we will put something in here eventually

SOME NOTES:
in order to do anything with fastText, you need to follow the instructions here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText. you also need to install gensim.

for the testing files, make sure you are in the test_files directory when running the scripts, or else the imports won't work due to relative vs absolute paths.
