As such, this course represents an important opportunity for students to develop the necessary knowledge, tools, and skills to make informed decisions as they continue with their lives. Rather than being mired down with facts and vocabulary, the typical non-science major student needs information presented in a way that is easy to read and understand. Even more importantly, the content should be meaningful. Students do much better when they understand why biology is relevant to their everyday lives. For these reasons, </span>Concepts of Biology <span class="p">is grounded on an evolutionary basis and includes exciting features that highlight careers in the biological sciences and everyday applications of the concepts at hand. We also strive to show the interconnectedness of topics within this extremely broad discipline. In order to meet the needs of today’s instructors and students, we maintain the overall organization and coverage found in most syllabi for this course. A strength of </span>Concepts of Biology <span class="p">is that instructors can customize the book,</span></p><p class="s20">2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Preface</p><p>adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. Concepts of Biology also includes an innovative art program that incorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to help students understand—and apply—key concepts.</p><p class="s24">Coverage and Scope</p><p>Our <i>Concepts of Biology </i>textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most one-semester non-majors courses nationwide. We also strive to make biology, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. In addition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts and foundational research, we have incorporated features that draw learners into the discipline in meaningful ways. Our scope of content was developed after surveying over a hundred biology professors and listening to their coverage needs. We provide a thorough treatment of biology’s fundamental concepts with a scope that is manageable for instructors and students alike.<br/>Unit 1: <b>The Cellular Foundation of Life</b>. Our opening unit introduces students to the sciences, including the process of science and the underlying concepts from the physical sciences that provide a framework within which learners comprehend biological processes. Additionally, students will gain solid understanding of the structures, functions, and processes of the most basic unit of life: the cell.<br/>Unit 2: <b>Cell Division and Genetics</b>. Our genetics unit takes learners from the foundations of cellular reproduction to the experiments that revealed the basis of genetics and laws of inheritance.<br/>Unit 3: <b>Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</b>. Students will learn the intricacies of DNA, protein synthesis, and gene regulation and current applications of biotechnology and genomics.<br/>Unit 4: <b>Evolution and the Diversity of Life</b>. The core concepts of evolution are discussed in this unit with examples illustrating evolutionary processes. Additionally, the evolutionary basis of biology reappears throughout the textbook in general discussion and is reinforced through special call-out features highlighting specific evolution-based topics. The diversity of life is explored with detailed study of various organisms and discussion of emerging phylogenetic relationships between and among bacteria, protist kingdoms, fungi, plants, and animals.<br/>Unit 5: <b>Animal Structure and Function</b>. An introduction to the form and function of the animal body is followed by chapters on the immune system and animal development. This unit touches on the biology of all organisms while maintaining an engaging focus on human anatomy and physiology that helps students connect to the topics.<br/>Unit 6: <b>Ecology</b>. Ecological concepts are broadly covered in this unit, with features highlighting localized, real-world issues of conservation and biodiversity.</p><p class="s24">Pedagogical Foundation and Features</p><p>Because of the impact science has on students and society, an important goal of science education is to achieve a scientifically  literate  population  that  consistently  makes  informed  decisions.  Scientific  literacy  transcends  a  basic understanding of scientific principles and processes to include the ability to make sense of the myriad instances where people encounter science in day-to-day life. Thus, a scientifically literate person is one who uses science content knowledge to make informed decisions, either personally or socially, about topics or issues that have a connection with science. Concepts of Biology is grounded on a solid scientific base and designed to promote scientific literacy. Throughout the text, you will find features that engage the students in scientific inquiry by taking selected topics a step further.</p><p class="s27">Evolution in Action <span class="p">features uphold the importance of evolution to all biological study through discussions like</span></p><p>“Global Decline of Coral Reefs” and “The Red Queen Hypothesis.”</p><p class="s27">Career in Action <span class="p">features present information on a variety of careers in the biological sciences, introducing students to the educational requirements and day-to-day work life of a variety of professions, such as forensic scientists, registered dietitians, and biogeographers.</span></p><p class="s27">Biology in Action <span class="p">features tie biological concepts to emerging issues and discuss science in terms of everyday life. Topics include “Invasive Species” and “Photosynthesis at the Grocery Store.”</span></p><p class="s24">Art and Animations that Engage</p><p>Our art program takes a straightforward approach designed to help students learn the concepts of biology through simple, effective illustrations, photos, and micrographs. Concepts of Biology also incorporates links to relevant animations and interactive exercises that help bring biology to life for students.</p><p class="s27">Art Connection <span class="p">features call out core figures in each chapter for student attention. Questions about key figures, including clicker questions that can be used in the classroom, engage students’ critical thinking and analytical abilities to ensure their genuine understanding of the concept at hand.</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Preface                                                                                                                                                                                                                              3</p><p class="s27">Concepts in Action <span class="p">features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations to add a fuller context and examples to core content.</span></p><p class="s23">About Our Team</p><p class="s22">Concepts of Biology <span class="p">would not be possible if not for the tremendous contributions of the authors and community reviewing team</span></p><p class="s24">Senior Contributing Authors</p><p>Samantha Fowler  Clayton State University Rebecca Roush    Sandhills Community  College James Wise            Hampton University</p><p class="s24">Contributing Authors and Reviewers</p><p>Mark Belk                 Brigham Young University<br/>Lisa Boggs                Southwestern Oklahoma State University<br/>Sherryl Broverman Duke University<br/>David Byres              Florida State College  at Jacksonville Aaron Cassill            The University of Texas at San  Antonio Karen Champ         College  of Central  Florida<br/>Sue  Chaplin              University of St. Thomas<br/>Diane Day                 Clayton State University<br/>Jean DeSaix             University of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill<br/>David Hunnicutt       St. Norbert College<br/>Barbara Kuehner    Hawaii Community  College<br/>Brenda Leady           University of Toledo<br/>Bernie Marcus          Genesee Community  College<br/>Flora Mhlanga          Lipscomb  University Madeline  Mignone   Dominican  College Elizabeth Nash         Long Beach City College Mark Newton            San  Jose City College<br/>Diana Oliveras          University of Colorado Boulder<br/>Ann Paterson         Williams Baptist  College Joel  Piperberg        Millersville University Nick Reeves           Mt.

It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life.</span></p><p class="s20">6                                                                                                                                                                                                             Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology</p><p>From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared properties that make something “alive”? How do those various living things function? When faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them? And, finally—what biologists ultimately seek to understand—how did this diversity arise and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.</p><p class="s24">Properties of Life</p><p>All groups of living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, and energy processing. When viewed together, these eight characteristics serve to define life.</p><p class="s34">Order</p><p>Organisms are highly organized structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled organisms are remarkably complex. Inside each cell, atoms make up molecules. These in turn make up cell components or organelles. Multicellular organisms, which may consist of millions of individual cells, have an advantage over single-celled organisms in that their cells can be specialized to perform specific functions, and even sacrificed in certain situations for the good of the organism as a whole. How these specialized cells come together to form organs such as the heart, lung, or skin in organisms like the toad shown in <span class="s32">Figure 1.2 </span>will be discussed later.<br/><span><IMG width="326" height="212" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_018.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  1.2  <span class="s30">A toad  represents a  highly organized structure consisting of cells,  tissues, organs, and  organ  systems.

For example, plants can bend toward a source of light or respond to touch (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">1.3<span class="p">). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called chemotaxis) or light (phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is considered a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus is considered a negative response.</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                            7</p><p><span><IMG width="326" height="245" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_019.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_020.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  1.3 </span>The leaves of this sensitive plant (<i>Mimosa  pudica</i>)  will instantly  droop  and  fold when  touched.

Many multicellular organisms (those made up of more than one cell) produce specialized reproductive cells that will form new individuals. When reproduction occurs, DNA containing genes is passed along to an organism’s offspring. These genes are the reason that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have characteristics similar to the parent, such as fur color and blood type.</p><p class="s34">Adaptation</p><p>All living organisms exhibit a “fit” to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as adaptation and it is a consequence of evolution by natural selection, which operates in every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples of adaptations are diverse and unique, from heat-resistant Archaea that live in boiling hot springs to the tongue length of a nectar-feeding moth that matches the size of the flower from which it feeds. All adaptations enhance the reproductive potential of the individual exhibiting them, including their ability to survive to reproduce. Adaptations are not constant. As an environment changes, natural selection causes the characteristics of the individuals in a population to track those changes.</p><p class="s34">Growth and Development</p><p>Organisms grow and develop according to specific instructions coded for by their genes. These genes provide instructions that will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species’ young (<span class="s32">Figure 1.4</span>) will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents.</p><p class="s20">8                                                                                                                                                                                                             Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology</p><p><span><IMG width="360" height="240" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_022.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  1.4 <span class="s30">Although no two look alike, these kittens  have  inherited  genes from both  parents and  share many  of the same characteristics.

For example, organ systems such as the digestive or circulatory systems perform specific functions like carrying oxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.</p><p class="s34">Homeostasis</p><p>To function properly, cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and concentrations of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through a process called <b>homeostasis </b>or “steady state”—the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions. For example, many organisms regulate their body temperature in a process known as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (<span class="s32">Figure 1.5</span>), have body structures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. In hot climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.<br/><span><IMG width="360" height="257" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_023.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 1.5 <span class="s30">Polar bears and other mammals living in ice-covered regions maintain  their body temperature by generating heat  and reducing heat  loss through  thick fur and a dense layer of fat under  their skin.

The <b>atom </b>is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form molecules. A <b>molecule </b>is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by a chemical bond. Many molecules that are biologically important are <b>macromolecules</b>, large molecules that are typically formed by combining smaller units called monomers.

Organelles are small structures that exist within cells and perform specialized functions. All living things are made of cells; the <b>cell </b>itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. <b>Prokaryotes </b>are single-celled organisms that lack organelles surrounded by a membrane and do not have nuclei surrounded by nuclear membranes; in contrast, the cells of <b>eukaryotes </b>do have membrane-bound organelles and nuclei.<br/>In most multicellular organisms, cells combine to make <b>tissues</b>, which are groups of similar cells carrying out the same function. <b>Organs </b>are collections of tissues grouped together based on a common function. Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants. An <b>organ system </b>is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. For example vertebrate animals have many organ systems, such as the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. <b>Organisms </b>are individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as microorganisms.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s37">Chapter 1<span class="s38">1  </span>Introduction to Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                     <span class="s39">11</span></p><p><span><IMG width="251" height="73" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_028.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="24" height="53" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_029.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="19" height="53" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_030.png"/></span></p><h4>a  r      <span class="s40"> </span><span class="s41">CONNECTION</span></h4><p><span><IMG width="254" height="646" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_031.png"/></span></p><p class="s43"><span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">Atom</span>:A <span style=" color: #212D36;">bas</span><span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">i</span>c <span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">u</span>nit <span style=" color: #212D36;">of matte</span><span style=" color: #0A0C0A;">r </span><span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">t</span><span style=" color: #212D36;">hat </span>consists of a dense central <span style=" color: #212D36;">nucleus </span>sur<span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">r</span><span style=" color: #212D36;">ounded </span>by a cloud of <span style=" color: #212D36;">negatively </span>charged electrons.</p><p class="s44"><span style=" color: #0A0C0A;">Mol</span>ec<span style=" color: #0A0C0A;">ule</span>:<span style=" color: #36444D;">A p</span><span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">h</span><span style=" color: #36444D;">ospholip</span><span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">i</span>d, <span style=" color: #36444D;">composed o</span><span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">f </span>many <span style=" color: #36444D;">atoms.</span></p><p class="s44"><span style=" color: #0A0C0A;">Organ</span>s <span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">and organ system</span>s: <span style=" color: #36444D;">Organs such as the stomach and </span>intestine make <span style=" color: #36444D;">up part of </span>the human digestive <span style=" color: #36444D;">system</span><span style=" color: #566975;">.</span></p><p class="s42">Th<span style=" color: #212D36;">e </span>bi<span style=" color: #212D36;">osp</span>her<span style=" color: #212D36;">e:</span><span style=" color: #36444D;">Encompasses all the ecosyste</span>m<span style=" color: #36444D;">s on Earth.</span></p><p class="s49"><span style=" color: #CF6E3B;">Figure 1.8 </span><span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">From </span><span style=" color: #343428;">a</span>n <span style=" color: #343428;">a</span>tom to the <span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">entire Earth, </span><span style=" color: #343428;">b</span>i<span style=" color: #343428;">o</span>logy <span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">examines all aspects of </span>life<span style=" color: #343428;">. </span><span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">(credit </span><span style=" color: #343428;">&quot;mo</span>le<span style=" color: #343428;">c</span>ule&quot;<span style=" color: #575746;">: </span>m<span style=" color: #343428;">od</span>ific<span style=" color: #343428;">a</span>tion of <span style=" color: #1D1F1A;">work </span>by Jane Whitney;

Communities exist within ecosystems which exist in the biosphere.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="121" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_032.png"/></span><br/>All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a <b>population</b>. For example, a forest may include many white pine trees. All of these pine trees represent the population of white pine trees in this forest. Different populations may live in the same specific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations. A <b>community </b>is the set of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forest’s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. An <b>ecosystem </b>consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, or non-living, parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rainwater. At the highest level of organization (<span class="s32">Figure 1.8</span>), the <b>biosphere </b>is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on Earth. It includes land, water, and portions of the atmosphere.</p><p class="s24">The Diversity of Life</p><p>The science of biology is very broad in scope because there is a tremendous diversity of life on Earth. The source of this diversity is <b>evolution</b>, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species. Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems.<br/>In the 18th century, a scientist named Carl Linnaeus first proposed organizing the known species of organisms into a hierarchical taxonomy. In this system, species that are most similar to each other are put together within a grouping known as a genus. Furthermore, similar genera (the plural of genus) are put together within a family. This grouping continues until all organisms are collected together into groups at the highest level. The current taxonomic system now has eight levels in its hierarchy, from lowest to highest, they are: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain. Thus species are grouped within genera, genera are grouped within families, families are grouped within orders, and so on (<span class="s32">Figure 1.9</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="253" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_033.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  1.9 <span class="s30">This diagram shows the levels  of taxonomic hierarchy for a dog, from the broadest category—domain—to the most specific—species.</span></p><p>The highest level, domain, is a relatively new addition to the system since the 1990s. Scientists now recognize three domains of life, the Eukarya, the Archaea, and the Bacteria. The domain Eukarya contains organisms that have cells with nuclei. It includes the kingdoms of fungi, plants, animals, and several kingdoms of protists. The Archaea, are single-celled organisms without nuclei and include many extremophiles that live in harsh environments like hot springs. The Bacteria are another quite different group of single-celled organisms without nuclei (<span class="s32">Figure 1.10</span>). Both the Archaea and the Bacteria are prokaryotes, an informal name for cells without nuclei. The recognition in the 1990s that certain “bacteria,” now known as the Archaea, were as different genetically and biochemically from other bacterial cells as they were from eukaryotes, motivated the recommendation to divide life into three domains. This dramatic change in our knowledge of the tree of life demonstrates that classifications are not permanent and will change when new information becomes available.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                          13</p><p>In addition to the hierarchical taxonomic system, Linnaeus was the first to name organisms using two unique names, now called the binomial naming system. Before Linnaeus, the use of common names to refer to organisms caused confusion because there were regional differences in these common names. Binomial names consist of the genus name (which is capitalized) and the species name (all lower-case). Both names are set in italics when they are printed. Every species is given a unique binomial which is recognized the world over, so that a scientist in any location can know which organism is being referred to. For example, the North American blue jay is known uniquely as <i>Cyanocitta cristata</i>. Our own species is <i>Homo sapiens</i>.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="131" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_034.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  1.10  <span class="s30">These images represent different  domains.

A <b>phylogenetic tree </b>is a diagram showing  the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities  and  differences in genetic or physical  traits or both. A phylogenetic tree  is composed of branch points,  or nodes, and  branches. The internal  nodes represent ancestors and  are  points  in evolution  when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor is thought  to have  diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch can be considered as estimates of relative time.<br/>In the  past,  biologists  grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants,  fungi,  protists,  and bacteria. The  pioneering work  of  American   microbiologist  Carl  Woese in  the  early  1970s has   shown, however, that life on Earth  has  evolved  along  three  lineages, now called  domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Woese proposed the domain  as a new taxonomic level and  Archaea as a new domain,  to reflect the  new  phylogenetic tree  (<span class="s32">Figure  1.11</span>).  Many  organisms belonging to the  Archaea domain  live under extreme conditions and  are  called  extremophiles. To construct his tree,  Woese used genetic relationships rather  than  similarities  based on morphology  (shape). Various  genes were  used in phylogenetic studies. Woese’s tree  was  constructed from comparative sequencing of the  genes that  are  universally  distributed, found in some slightly altered form in every organism, conserved (meaning that these genes have  remained only slightly changed throughout evolution), and of an appropriate length.</p><p class="s29">Figure  1.11  <span class="s30">This  phylogenetic tree  was  constructed by microbiologist  Carl Woese using  genetic relationships. The tree  shows the separation of living organisms into three  domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and  Eukarya. Bacteria and Archaea are organisms without a nucleus or other organelles surrounded by a membrane and,  therefore, are prokaryotes.

Biologists may pursue one of those sub disciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance, molecular biology studies biological processes at the molecular level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the way they are regulated. Microbiology is the study of the structure and function of microorganisms. It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists, ecologists, and geneticists, among others.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                          15</p><p>Another field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is considered a branch of biology, it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience.

Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants, respectively. Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or physiologists, to name just a few areas. Biotechnologists apply the knowledge of biology to create useful products. Ecologists study the interactions of organisms in their environments. Physiologists study the workings of cells, tissues and organs. This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue. From our own bodies to the world we live in, discoveries in biology can affect us in very direct and important ways. We depend on these discoveries for our health, our food sources, and the benefits provided by our ecosystem. Because of this, knowledge of biology can benefit us in making decisions in our day-to-day lives.<br/>The development of technology in the twentieth century that continues today, particularly the technology to describe and manipulate the genetic material, DNA, has transformed biology. This transformation will allow biologists to continue to understand the history of life in greater detail, how the human body works, our human origins, and how humans can survive as a species on this planet despite the stresses caused by our increasing numbers. Biologists continue to decipher huge mysteries about life suggesting that we have only begun to understand life on the planet, its history, and our relationship to it. For this and other reasons, the knowledge of biology gained through this textbook and other printed and electronic media should be a benefit in whichever field you enter.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="618" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_037.png"/></span></p><p class="s20">16                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology</p><p class="s16">Forensic Scientist</p><p>Forensic science is the  application of science to answer questions related to the  law.

Interest in forensic science has  increased in the  last  few years, possibly  because of popular  television  shows that  feature forensic  scientists on the job. Also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA databases have  updated the types  of work that forensic  scientists can  do. Their job activities  are  primarily related to crimes  against people such  as murder,  rape,  and  assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such  as hair, blood,  and  other  body fluids and  also  processing DNA (<span class="s32">Figure  1.13</span>)  found in many  different environments and materials. Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such  as insect  parts  or pollen  grains.

Specifically, biology is the study of life. The discoveries of biology are made by a community of researchers who work individually and together using agreed-on methods. In this sense, biology, like all sciences is a social enterprise like politics or the arts. The methods of science include careful observation, record keeping, logical and mathematical reasoning, experimentation, and submitting conclusions to the scrutiny of others. Science also requires considerable imagination and creativity; a well-designed experiment is commonly described as elegant, or beautiful. Like politics, science has considerable practical implications and some science is dedicated to practical applications, such as the prevention of disease (see <span class="s32">Figure 1.15</span>). Other science proceeds largely motivated by curiosity. Whatever its goal, there is no doubt that science, including biology, has transformed human existence and will continue to do so.<br/><span><IMG width="402" height="292" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_040.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  1.15  </span>Biologists  may  choose to study  <i>Escherichia coli </i>(<i>E. coli</i>), a  bacterium that  is a  normal  resident of our digestive tracts  but  which  is also  sometimes responsible for disease outbreaks.

What does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines?<br/><b>Science </b>(from the Latin <i>scientia, </i>meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;) can be defined as knowledge about the natural world.<br/>Science is a very specific way of learning, or knowing, about the world. The history of the past 500 years demonstrates that science is a very powerful way of knowing about the world; it is largely responsible for the technological revolutions</p><p class="s20">18                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology</p><p>that have taken place during this time. There are however, areas of knowledge and human experience that the methods of science cannot be applied to. These include such things as answering purely moral questions, aesthetic questions, or what can be generally categorized as spiritual questions. Science has cannot investigate these areas because they are outside the realm of material phenomena, the phenomena of matter and energy, and cannot be observed and measured.<br/>The <b>scientific method </b>is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses. A <b>hypothesis </b>is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested. Hypotheses, or tentative explanations, are generally produced within the context of a <b>scientific theory</b>. A scientific theory is a generally accepted, thoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. Scientific theory is the foundation of scientific knowledge. In addition, in many scientific disciplines (less so in biology) there are <b>scientific laws</b>, often expressed in mathematical formulas, which describe how elements of nature will behave under certain specific conditions. There is not an evolution of hypotheses through theories to laws as if they represented some increase in certainty about the world. Hypotheses are the day-to-day material that scientists work with and they are developed within the context of theories. Laws are concise descriptions of parts of the world that are amenable to formulaic or mathematical description.</p><p class="s34">Natural Sciences</p><p>What would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about how the brain functions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Or maybe all of the above? Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy, biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (<span class="s32">Figure 1.16</span>). However, those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered <b>natural sciences</b>. Thus, a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above.<br/><span><IMG width="326" height="326" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_041.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  1.16  <span class="s30">Some fields of science include  astronomy, biology, computer science, geology,  logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics.

For some experts, the natural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into <b>life sciences</b>, which study living things and include biology, and <b>physical sciences</b>, which study nonliving matter and include astronomy, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on two sciences and are interdisciplinary.</p><p class="s34">Scientific Inquiry</p><p>One thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal “to know.” Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for the development of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. Two methods of logical thinking are used: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.</p><p class="s27">Inductive reasoning <span class="p">is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion. This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and records them.</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                          19</p><p>These data can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (consisting of numbers), and the raw data can be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies often work this way. Many brains are observed while people are doing a task. The part of the brain that lights up, indicating activity, is then demonstrated to be the part controlling the response to that task.<br/>Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reasoning, the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. <b>Deductive reasoning </b>is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. For example, a prediction would be that if the climate is becoming warmer in a region, the distribution of plants and animals should change. Comparisons have been made between distributions in the past and the present, and the many changes that have been found are consistent with a warming climate. Finding the change in distribution is evidence that the climate change conclusion is a valid one.<br/>Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesis- based science. <b>Descriptive </b>(or discovery) <b>science </b>aims to observe, explore, and discover, while <b>hypothesis-based science </b>begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, because most scientific endeavors combine both approaches. Observations lead to questions, questions lead to forming a hypothesis as a possible answer to those questions, and then the hypothesis is tested. Thus, descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.</p><p class="s24">Hypothesis Testing</p><p>Biologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses. This approach is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used even in ancient times, but it was first documented by England’s Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) (<span class="s32">Figure 1.17</span>), who set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific method is not exclusively used by biologists but can be applied to almost anything as a logical problem-solving method.<br/><span><IMG width="200" height="328" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_042.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 1.17 <span class="s30">Sir Francis Bacon  is credited with being the first to document the scientific method.</span></p><p>The scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to be solved) that leads to a question. Let’s think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem. One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: “Why is the classroom so warm?”<br/>Recall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may be proposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.”</p><p class="s20">20                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology</p><p>But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be proposed. A second hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn’t work.”<br/>Once a hypothesis has been selected, a prediction may be made. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has the format “If . . . then . . . .” For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, “<i>If </i>the student turns on the air conditioning, <i>then </i>the classroom will no longer be too warm.”<br/>A hypothesis must be testable to ensure that it is valid. For example, a hypothesis that depends on what a bear thinks is not testable, because it can never be known what a bear thinks. It should also be <b>falsifiable</b>, meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results. An example of an unfalsifiable hypothesis is “Botticelli’s <i>Birth of Venus </i>is beautiful.” There is no experiment that might show this statement to be false. To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. This is important. A hypothesis can be disproven, or eliminated, but it can never be proven. Science does not deal in proofs like mathematics. If an experiment fails to disprove a hypothesis, then we find support for that explanation, but this is not to say that down the road a better explanation will not be found, or a more carefully designed experiment will be found to falsify the hypothesis.<br/>Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls. A <b>variable </b>is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. A <b>control </b>is a part of the experiment that does not change. Look for the variables and controls in the example that follows. As a simple example, an experiment might be conducted to test the hypothesis that phosphate limits the growth of algae in freshwater ponds. A series of artificial ponds are filled with water and half of them are treated by adding phosphate each week, while the other half are treated by adding a salt that is known not to be used by algae. The variable here is the phosphate (or lack of phosphate), the experimental or treatment cases are the ponds with added phosphate and the control ponds are those with something inert added, such as the salt. Just adding something is also a control against the possibility that adding extra matter to the pond has an effect. If the treated ponds show lesser growth of algae, then we have found support for our hypothesis. If they do not, then we reject our hypothesis. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid (<span class="s32">Figure 1.18</span>). Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data are rejected.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                          21</p><p class="s29">Figure 1.18 <span class="s30">The scientific method is a series of defined  steps that include experiments and careful observation.

Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach; often, an experiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion; instead, scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds. Scientific reasoning is more complex than the scientific method alone suggests.</p><p class="s20">22                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 1 | Introduction  to Biology</p><p class="s24">Basic and Applied  Science</p><p>The scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the value of different types of science. Is it valuable to pursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth if we can apply it to solving a specific problem or bettering our lives? This question focuses on the differences between two types of science: basic science and applied science.</p><p class="s27">Basic science <span class="p">or “pure” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that knowledge. It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The immediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge’s sake, though this does not mean that in the end it may not result in an application.</span></p><p>In contrast, <b>applied science </b>or “technology,” aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible, for example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster. In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.<br/>Some individuals may perceive applied science as “useful” and basic science as “useless.” A question these people might pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, “What for?” A careful look at the history of science, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many scientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on the results generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of the knowledge generated through basic science.<br/>One example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication. Strands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication, new copies of DNA are made, shortly before a cell divides to form new cells. Understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to identify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity. Without basic science, it is unlikely that applied science would exist.<br/>Another example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which each human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the exact location of each gene. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individual’s complete collection of genes is his or her genome.) Other organisms have also been studied as part of this project to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (<span class="s32">Figure 1.19</span>) relied on basic research carried out with non-human organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the data for applied research seeking cures for genetically related diseases.<br/><span><IMG width="250" height="251" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_044.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  1.19  <span class="s30">The  Human  Genome Project  was  a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several different  fields  of science.

Communication and collaboration within and between sub disciplines of science are key to the advancement of knowledge in science. For this reason, an important aspect of a scientist’s work is disseminating results and communicating with peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the limited few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed articles that are published in scientific journals. <b>Peer-reviewed articles </b>are scientific papers that are reviewed, usually anonymously by a scientist’s colleagues, or peers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge whether or not the scientist’s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists.<br/>There are many journals and the popular press that do not use a peer-review system. A large number of online open- access journals, journals with articles available without cost, are now available many of which use rigorous peer-review systems, but some of which do not. Results of any studies published in these forums without peer review are not reliable and should not form the basis for other scientific work. In one exception, journals may allow a researcher to cite a personal communication from another researcher about unpublished results with the cited author ’s permission.</p><p class="s20">24

the science of life. All living organisms share several key properties such as order, sensitivity or response to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, and energy processing. Living things are highly organized following a hierarchy that includes atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. Organisms, in turn, are grouped as populations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere. Evolution is the source of the tremendous biological diversity on Earth today. A diagram called a phylogenetic tree can be used to show evolutionary relationships among organisms. Biology is very broad and includes many branches and sub disciplines. Examples include molecular biology, microbiology, neurobiology, zoology, and botany, among others.</p><p class="s52">1.2 The Process of Science</p><p>Biology is the science that studies living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments. Science attempts to describe and understand the nature of the universe in whole or in part. Science has many fields; those fields related to the physical world and its phenomena are considered natural sciences.<br/>A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an observation. A scientific theory is a well-tested and consistently verified explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. A scientific law is a description, often in the form of a mathematical formula, of the behavior of an aspect of nature under certain circumstances. Two types of logical reasoning are used in science. Inductive reasoning uses results to produce general scientific principles. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that predicts results by applying general principles. The common thread throughout scientific research is the use of the scientific method. Scientists present their results in peer-reviewed scientific papers published in scientific journals.<br/>Science can be basic or applied. The main goal of basic science is to expand knowledge without any expectation of short- term practical application of that knowledge. The primary goal of applied research, however, is to solve practical problems.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 1.8 </span><span class="p">Which of the following statements is false?</span></p><p>A.

In this chapter, we will discuss these important building blocks and learn how the unique properties of the atoms of different elements affect their interactions with other atoms to form the molecules of life.<br/>Food provides an organism with nutrients—the matter it needs to survive. Many of these critical nutrients come in the form of biological macromolecules, or large molecules necessary for life. These macromolecules are built from different combinations of smaller organic molecules. What specific types of biological macromolecules do living things require? How are these molecules formed? What functions do they serve? In this chapter, we will explore these questions.</p><p class="s20">28                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="106" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_047.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">2.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>The Building Blocks of Molecules</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe matter and elements<br/>•   Describe the interrelationship between protons, neutrons, and electrons, and the ways in which electrons can be donated or shared between atoms<br/>At its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter. <b>Matter </b>occupies space and has mass. All matter is composed of <b>elements</b>, substances that cannot be broken down or transformed chemically into other substances. Each element is made of atoms, each with a constant number of protons and unique properties. A total of 118 elements have been defined; however, only 92 occur naturally, and fewer than 30 are found in living cells. The remaining 26 elements are unstable and, therefore, do not exist for very long or are theoretical and have yet to be detected.<br/>Each element is designated by its chemical symbol (such as H, N, O, C, and Na), and possesses unique properties. These unique properties allow elements to combine and to bond with each other in specific ways.</p><p class="s24">Atoms</p><p>An atom is the smallest component of an element that retains all of the chemical properties of that element. For example, one hydrogen atom has all of the properties of the element hydrogen, such as it exists as a gas at room temperature, and it bonds with oxygen to create a water molecule. Hydrogen atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of hydrogen. If a hydrogen atom were broken down into subatomic particles, it would no longer have the properties of hydrogen.<br/>At the most basic level, all organisms are made of a combination of elements. They contain atoms that combine together to form molecules. In multicellular organisms, such as animals, molecules can interact to form cells that combine to form tissues, which make up organs. These combinations continue until entire multicellular organisms are formed.<br/>All atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons (<span class="s32">Figure 2.2</span>). The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one electron. A <b>proton </b>is a positively charged particle that resides in the <b>nucleus </b>(the core of the atom) of an atom and has a mass of 1 and a charge of +1. An <b>electron </b>is a negatively charged particle that travels in the space around the nucleus. In other words, it resides outside of the nucleus. It has a negligible mass and has a charge of –1.<br/><span><IMG width="298" height="185" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_048.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  2.2  <span class="s30">Atoms  are  made up of protons and  neutrons located within the  nucleus, and  electrons surrounding the nucleus.</span></p><p class="s27">Neutrons<span class="p">, like protons, reside in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of 1 and no charge. The positive (protons) and negative (electrons) charges balance each other in a neutral atom, which has a net zero charge.</span></p><p>Because protons and neutrons each have a mass of 1, the mass of an atom is equal to the number of protons and neutrons of that atom. The number of electrons does not factor into the overall mass, because their mass is so small.<br/>As stated earlier, each element has its own unique properties. Each contains a different number of protons and neutrons, giving it its own atomic number and mass number. The <b>atomic number </b>of an element is equal to the number of protons that element contains. The <b>mass number</b>, or atomic mass, is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons of that element. Therefore, it is possible to determine the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                   29</p><p>These numbers provide information about the elements and how they will react when combined. Different elements have different melting and boiling points, and are in different states (liquid, solid, or gas) at room temperature. They also combine in different ways. Some form specific types of bonds, whereas others do not. How they combine is based on the number of electrons present. Because of these characteristics, the elements are arranged into the <b>periodic table of elements</b>, a chart of the elements that includes the atomic number and relative atomic mass of each element. The periodic table also provides key information about the properties of elements (<span class="s32">Figure 2.2</span>)—often indicated by color-coding. The arrangement of the table also shows how the electrons in each element are organized and provides important details about how atoms will react with each other to form molecules.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="540" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_049.png"/></span></p><p class="s27">Isotopes <span class="p">are different forms of the same element that have the same number of protons, but a different number of neutrons. Some elements, such as carbon, potassium, and uranium, have naturally occurring isotopes. Carbon-12, the most common isotope of carbon, contains six protons and six neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 12 (six protons and six neutrons) and an atomic number of 6 (which makes it carbon). Carbon-14 contains six protons and eight neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 14 (six protons and eight neutrons) and an atomic number of 6, meaning it is still the element carbon. These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes. Some isotopes are unstable and will lose protons, other subatomic particles, or energy to form more stable elements. These are called </span>radioactive isotopes <span class="p">or radioisotopes.</span></p><p class="s29">Figure 2.3 <span class="s30">Arranged in columns and rows based on the characteristics of the elements, the periodic table provides key information about  the elements and how they might interact  with each other  to form molecules.

This is a continuous process, so more  <span class="s54">14</span>C  is always  being  created. As a living organism develops, the relative level of <span class="s54">14</span>C in its body is equal  to the concentration of <span class="s54">14</span>C in the atmosphere. When  an organism dies,  it is no longer ingesting <span class="s54">14</span>C, so the ratio will decline. <span class="s54">14</span>C decays to <span class="s54">14</span>N by a process called beta  decay; it gives off energy in this slow process.<br/>After approximately 5,730  years, only one-half  of the starting  concentration of <span class="s54">14</span>C will have  been converted to <span class="s54">14</span>N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay to its more  stable form is called  its half-life. Because the  half-life of <span class="s54">14</span>C  is long, it is used to age  formerly living objects, such  as fossils.  Using  the  ratio of the  <span class="s54">14</span>C  concentration found  in an  object  to the  amount of <span class="s54">14</span>C  detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that has  not yet decayed can be determined. Based on this amount, the age  of the fossil can  be calculated to about  50,000 years (<span class="s32">Figure  2.4</span>).

Electrons exist at energy levels that form shells around the nucleus. The closest shell can hold up to two electrons. The closest shell to the nucleus is always filled first, before any other shell can be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot occupied within the lowest shell. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the lowest shell with its two electrons. If you look at the periodic table, you will see that hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row. This is because they only have electrons in their first shell. Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the lowest shell and no other shells.<br/>The second and third energy levels can hold up to eight electrons. The eight electrons are arranged in four pairs and one position in each pair is filled with an electron before any pairs are completed.<br/>Looking at the periodic table again (<span class="s32">Figure 2.3</span>), you will notice that there are seven rows. These rows correspond to the number of shells that the elements within that row have. The elements within a particular row have increasing numbers of electrons as the columns proceed from left to right. Although each element has the same number of shells, not all of the shells are completely filled with electrons. If you look at the second row of the periodic table, you will find lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne). These all have electrons that occupy only the first and second shells. Lithium has only one electron in its outermost shell, beryllium has two electrons, boron has three, and so on, until the entire shell is filled with eight electrons, as is the case with neon.<br/>Not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, but an atom is at its most stable when all of the electron positions in the outermost shell are filled. Because of these vacancies in the outermost shells, we see the formation of <b>chemical bonds</b>, or interactions between two or more of the same or different elements that result in the formation of molecules. To achieve greater stability, atoms will tend to completely fill their outer shells and will bond with other elements to accomplish this goal by sharing electrons, accepting electrons from another atom, or donating electrons to another atom. Because the outermost shells of the elements with low atomic numbers (up to calcium, with atomic number 20) can hold eight electrons, this is referred to as the <b>octet rule</b>. An element can donate, accept, or share electrons with other elements to fill its outer shell and satisfy the octet rule.<br/>When an atom does not contain equal numbers of protons and electrons, it is called an <b>ion</b>. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. Positive ions are formed by losing electrons and are called <b>cations</b>. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called <b>anions</b>.<br/>For example, sodium only has one electron in its outermost shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons and only<br/>10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now called a sodium ion.<br/>The chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (–1) charge. It is now called a chloride ion. This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as <b>electron transfer</b>. As <span class="s32">Figure 2.5 </span>illustrates, a sodium atom (Na) only has one electron in its outermost shell, whereas a chlorine atom (Cl) has seven electrons in its outermost shell. A sodium atom will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and a chlorine atom will accept that electron to fill its shell, becoming chloride. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium) or –1 (chloride) charge.</p><p class="s20">32                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life</p><p><span><IMG width="352" height="328" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_053.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  2.5  <span class="s30">Elements tend  to fill  their  outermost shells  with electrons. To do  this,  they  can  either  donate or accept electrons from other  elements.</span></p><p class="s34">Ionic Bonds</p><p>There are four types of bonds or interactions: ionic, covalent, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions. Ionic and covalent bonds are strong interactions that require a larger energy input to break apart. When an element donates an electron from its outer shell, as in the sodium atom example above, a positive ion is formed. The element accepting the electron is now negatively charged. Because positive and negative charges attract, these ions stay together and form an <b>ionic bond</b>, or a bond between ions. The elements bond together with the electron from one element staying predominantly with the other element. When Na<span class="s54">+ </span>and Cl<span class="s54">– </span>ions combine to produce NaCl, an electron from a sodium atom stays with the other seven from the chlorine atom, and the sodium and chloride ions attract each other in a lattice of ions with a net zero charge.</p><p class="s34">Covalent Bonds</p><p>Another type of strong chemical bond between two or more atoms is a <b>covalent bond</b>. These bonds form when an electron is shared between two elements and are the strongest and most common form of chemical bond in living organisms. Covalent bonds form between the elements that make up the biological molecules in our cells. Unlike ionic bonds, covalent bonds do not dissociate in water.<br/>The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds. The electron from the hydrogen atom divides its time between the outer shell of the hydrogen atom and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atom. To completely fill the outer shell of an oxygen atom, two electrons from two hydrogen atoms are needed, hence the subscript “2” in H<span class="s54">2</span>O. The electrons are shared between the atoms, dividing their time between them to “fill” the outer shell of each. This sharing is a lower energy state for all of the atoms involved than if they existed without their outer shells filled.<br/>There are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. <b>Nonpolar covalent bonds </b>form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share the electrons equally. For example, an oxygen atom can bond with another oxygen atom to fill their outer shells. This association is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between each oxygen atom. Two covalent bonds form between the two oxygen atoms because oxygen requires two shared electrons to fill its outermost shell. Nitrogen atoms will form three covalent bonds (also called triple covalent) between two atoms of nitrogen because each nitrogen atom needs three electrons to fill its outermost shell. Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is found in the methane (CH<span class="s54">4</span>) molecule. The carbon atom has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one. These elements all share the electrons equally, creating four nonpolar covalent bonds (<span class="s32">Figure 2.6</span>).<br/>In a <b>polar covalent bond</b>, the electrons shared by the atoms spend more time closer to one nucleus than to the other nucleus. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the different nuclei, a slightly positive (δ+) or slightly negative (δ–) charge develops. The covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are polar covalent bonds.

However, not all bonds between elements are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form. These are attractions that occur between positive and negative charges that do not require much energy to break. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. These bonds give rise to the unique properties of water and the unique structures of DNA and proteins.<br/>When polar covalent bonds containing a hydrogen atom form, the hydrogen atom in that bond has a slightly positive charge. This is because the shared electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen nucleus. Because the hydrogen atom is slightly positive (δ+), it will be attracted to neighboring negative partial charges (δ–). When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the δ+ charge of the hydrogen atom of one molecule and the δ– charge of the other molecule. This interaction is called a <b>hydrogen bond</b>. This type of bond is common; for example, the liquid nature of water is caused by the hydrogen bonds between water molecules (<span class="s32">Figure 2.7</span>). Hydrogen bonds give water the unique properties that sustain life. If it were not for hydrogen bonding, water would be a gas rather than a liquid at room temperature.<br/><span><IMG width="348" height="171" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_055.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  2.7  </span>Hydrogen bonds form between slightly positive  (<i>δ</i>+) and  slightly negative (<i>δ</i>–)  charges of polar  covalent molecules, such  as water.</p><p>Hydrogen bonds can form between different molecules and they do not always have to include a water molecule.

It is because water is essential to life; even minute traces of it on another planet can indicate that life could or did exist on that planet. Water is one of the more abundant molecules in living cells and the one most critical to life as we know it. Approximately 60–70 percent of your body is made up of water. Without it, life simply would not exist.</p><p class="s24">Water Is Polar</p><p>The hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend more time associated with the oxygen atom than they do with hydrogen atoms. There is no overall charge to a water molecule, but there is a slight positive charge on each hydrogen atom and a slight negative charge on the oxygen atom. Because of these charges, the slightly positive hydrogen atoms repel each other and form the unique shape seen in <span class="s32">Figure 2.7</span>. Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the positive and negative charges in the different parts of the molecule. Water also attracts other polar molecules (such as sugars), forming hydrogen bonds. When a substance readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred to as <b>hydrophilic </b>(“water-loving”). Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils and fats (<span class="s32">Figure 2.8</span>). These nonpolar compounds are <b>hydrophobic </b>(“water- fearing”) and will not dissolve in water.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                   35</p><p><span><IMG width="278" height="244" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_058.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  2.8 <span class="s30">As this macroscopic image  of oil and  water  show,  oil is a nonpolar compound and,  hence, will not dissolve in water.

As the motion increases, energy is higher and thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy disrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be created and disrupted rapidly, water absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only minimally. This means that water moderates temperature changes within organisms and in their environments. As energy input continues, the balance between hydrogen-bond formation and destruction swings toward the destruction side. More bonds are broken than are formed. This process results in the release of individual water molecules at the surface of the liquid (such as a body of water, the leaves of a plant, or the skin of an organism) in a process called <b>evaporation</b>. Evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows for cooling of an organism, because breaking hydrogen bonds requires an input of energy and takes heat away from the body.<br/>Conversely, as molecular motion decreases and temperatures drop, less energy is present to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. These bonds remain intact and begin to form a rigid, lattice-like structure (e.g., ice) (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">2.9<span style=" color: #000;">a</span><span class="p">). When frozen, ice is less dense than liquid water (the molecules are farther apart). This means that ice floats on the surface of a body of water (</span>Figure 2.9<span style=" color: #000;">b</span><span class="p">). In lakes, ponds, and oceans, ice will form on the surface of the water, creating an insulating barrier to protect the animal and plant life beneath from freezing in the water. If this did not happen, plants and animals living in water would freeze in a block of ice and could not move freely, making life in cold temperatures difficult or impossible.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="504" height="212" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_059.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  2.9 <span class="s30">(a) The lattice  structure of ice makes it less  dense than  the freely flowing molecules of liquid water.

You have probably used <b>litmus paper</b>, paper that has been treated with a natural water-soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator, to test how much acid or base (alkalinity) exists in a solution. You might have even used some to make sure the water in an outdoor swimming pool is properly treated. In both cases, this pH test measures the amount of hydrogen ions that exists in a given solution. High concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH. The overall concentration of hydrogen ions is inversely related to its pH and can be measured on the <b>pH scale </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 2.12</span>). Therefore, the more hydrogen ions present, the lower the pH; conversely, the fewer hydrogen ions, the higher the pH.<br/>The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A change of one unit on the pH scale represents a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions by a factor of 10, a change in two units represents a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions by a factor of 100. Thus, small changes in pH represent large changes in the concentrations of hydrogen ions. Pure water is neutral. It is neither acidic nor basic, and has a pH of 7.0. Anything below 7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from<br/>7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. The blood in your veins is slightly alkaline (pH = 7.4). The environment in your stomach is highly acidic (pH = 1 to 2).

The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H<span class="s54">+</span>. For example, hydrochloric acid and lemon juice are very acidic and readily give up H<span class="s54">+ </span>when added to water. Conversely, bases are those substances that readily donate OH<span class="s54">–</span>. The OH<span class="s54">– </span>ions combine with H<span class="s54">+ </span>to produce water, which raises a substance’s pH. Sodium hydroxide and many household cleaners are very alkaline and give up OH<span class="s54">– </span>rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the pH.<br/>Most cells in our bodies operate within a very narrow window of the pH scale, typically ranging only from 7.2 to 7.6. If the pH of the body is outside of this range, the respiratory system malfunctions, as do other organs in the body. Cells no longer function properly, and proteins will break down. Deviation outside of the pH range can induce coma or even cause death.<br/>So how is it that we can ingest or inhale acidic or basic substances and not die? Buffers are the key. <b>Buffers </b>readily absorb excess H<span class="s54">+ </span>or OH<span class="s54">–</span>, keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the aforementioned narrow range. Carbon dioxide is part of a prominent buffer system in the human body; it keeps the pH within the proper range. This buffer system involves<br/>carbonic acid (H<span class="s54">2</span>CO<span class="s54">3</span>) and bicarbonate (HCO <span class="s54">–</span>) anion. If too much H<span class="s54">+</span><br/>enters the body, bicarbonate will combine with the<br/>H<span class="s54">+ </span>to create carbonic acid and limit the decrease in pH. Likewise, if too much OH<span class="s54">– </span>is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will rapidly dissociate into bicarbonate and H<span class="s54">+ </span>ions. The H<span class="s54">+ </span>ions can combine with the OH<span class="s54">– </span>ions, limiting the increase in pH. While carbonic acid is an important product in this reaction, its presence is fleeting because the carbonic acid is released from the body as carbon dioxide gas each time we breathe. Without this buffer system, the pH in our bodies would fluctuate too much and we would fail to survive.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                   39</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="134" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_068.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">2.3 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Biological Molecules</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the ways in which carbon is critical to life<br/>•   Explain the impact of slight changes in amino acids on organisms<br/>•   Describe the four major types of biological molecules<br/>•   Understand the functions of the four major types of molecules<br/>The large molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules are called biological <b>macromolecules</b>. There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids), and each is an important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions. Combined, these molecules make up the majority of a cell’s mass. Biological macromolecules are organic, meaning that they contain carbon. In addition, they may contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and additional minor elements.</p><p class="s24">Carbon</p><p>It is often said that life is “carbon-based.” This means that carbon atoms, bonded to other carbon atoms or other elements, form the fundamental components of many, if not most, of the molecules found uniquely in living things. Other elements play important roles in biological molecules, but carbon certainly qualifies as the “foundation” element for molecules in living things. It is the bonding properties of carbon atoms that are responsible for its important role.</p><p class="s24">Carbon Bonding</p><p>Carbon contains four electrons in its outer shell. Therefore, it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms or molecules. The simplest organic carbon molecule is methane (CH<span class="s54">4</span>), in which four hydrogen atoms bind to a carbon atom (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">2.13<span class="p">).</span></p><p><span><IMG width="402" height="191" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_069.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  2.13  </span>Carbon can  form four covalent bonds to create an  organic  molecule.

Any of the hydrogen atoms can be replaced with another carbon atom covalently bonded to the first carbon atom. In this way, long and branching chains of carbon compounds can be made (<span class="s32">Figure 2.14</span><b>a</b>). The carbon atoms may bond with atoms of other elements, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus (<span class="s32">Figure 2.14</span><b>b</b>). The molecules may also form rings, which themselves can link with other rings (<span class="s32">Figure 2.14</span><b>c</b>). This diversity of molecular forms accounts for the diversity of functions of the biological macromolecules and is based to a large degree on the ability of carbon to form multiple bonds with itself and other atoms.</p><p class="s20">40                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life</p><p><span><IMG width="298" height="366" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_070.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  2.14  <span class="s30">These examples show  three  molecules (found in living organisms) that contain  carbon atoms bonded in various  ways to other carbon atoms and the atoms of other elements.

(c) Glucose, a sugar, has  a ring of carbon atoms and one oxygen  atom.</span></p><p class="s24">Carbohydrates</p><p class="s27">Carbohydrates <span class="p">are macromolecules with which most consumers are somewhat familiar. To lose weight, some individuals adhere to “low-carb” diets. Athletes, in contrast, often “carb-load” before important competitions to ensure that they have sufficient energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our diet; grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to the body, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar. Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans, animals, and plants.</span></p><p>Carbohydrates can be represented by the formula (CH<span class="s54">2</span>O)<span class="s56">n</span>, where <i>n </i>is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. In other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. Carbohydrates are classified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.</p><p class="s27">Monosaccharides <span class="p">(mono- = “one”; sacchar- = “sweet”) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In monosaccharides, the number of carbon atoms usually ranges from three to six. Most monosaccharide names end with the suffix -ose. Depending on the number of carbon atoms in the sugar, they may be known as trioses (three carbon atoms), pentoses (five carbon atoms), and hexoses (six carbon atoms).</span></p><p>Monosaccharides may exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules; in aqueous solutions, they are usually found in the ring form.<br/>The chemical formula for glucose is C<span class="s54">6</span>H<span class="s54">12</span>O<span class="s54">6</span>. In most living species, glucose is an important source of energy. During cellular respiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Plants synthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water by the process of photosynthesis, and the glucose, in turn, is used for the energy requirements of the plant. The excess synthesized glucose is often stored as starch that is broken down by other organisms that feed on plants.<br/>Galactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in fruit) are other common monosaccharides. Although glucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (C<span class="s54">6</span>H<span class="s54">12</span>O<span class="s54">6</span>), they differ structurally and chemically (and are known as isomers) because of differing arrangements of atoms in the carbon chain (<span class="s32">Figure 2.15</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                   41</p><p><span><IMG width="376" height="285" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_071.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  2.15  <span class="s30">Glucose, galactose, and  fructose are  isomeric  monosaccharides, meaning that  they  have  the  same chemical formula but slightly different structures.</span></p><p><b>Disaccharides </b>(di- = “two”) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (a reaction in which the removal of a water molecule occurs). During this process, the hydroxyl group (–OH) of one monosaccharide combines with a hydrogen atom of another monosaccharide, releasing a molecule of water (H<span class="s54">2</span>O) and forming a covalent bond between atoms in the two sugar molecules.<br/>Common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the monomers glucose and galactose. It is found naturally in milk. Maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed from a dehydration reaction between two glucose molecules. The most common disaccharide is sucrose, or table sugar, which is composed of the monomers glucose and fructose.<br/>A long chain of monosaccharides linked by covalent bonds is known as a <b>polysaccharide </b>(poly- = “many”). The chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. Polysaccharides may be very large molecules. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are examples of polysaccharides.</p><p class="s27">Starch <span class="p">is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose). Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose is stored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds. The starch that is consumed by animals is broken down into smaller molecules, such as glucose. The cells can then absorb the glucose.</span></p><p class="s27">Glycogen <span class="p">is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates, and is made up of monomers of glucose. Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells. Whenever glucose levels decrease, glycogen is broken down to release glucose.</span></p><p class="s27">Cellulose <span class="p">is one of the most abundant natural biopolymers. The cell walls of plants are mostly made of cellulose, which provides structural support to the cell. Wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature. Cellulose is made up of glucose monomers that are linked by bonds between particular carbon atoms in the glucose molecule.</span></p><p>Every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over and packed tightly as extended long chains. This gives cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strength—which is so important to plant cells. Cellulose passing through our digestive system is called dietary fiber. While the glucose-glucose bonds in cellulose cannot be broken down by human digestive enzymes, herbivores such as cows, buffalos, and horses are able to digest grass that is rich in cellulose and use it as a food source. In these animals, certain species of bacteria reside in the rumen (part of the digestive system of herbivores) and secrete the enzyme cellulase. The appendix also contains bacteria that break down cellulose, giving it an important role in the digestive systems of ruminants. Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that can be used as an energy source by the animal.<br/>Carbohydrates serve other functions in different animals. Arthropods, such as insects, spiders, and crabs, have an outer skeleton, called the exoskeleton, which protects their internal body parts. This exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule <b>chitin</b>, which is a nitrogenous carbohydrate. It is made of repeating units of a modified sugar containing nitrogen.</p><p class="s20">42                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life</p><p>Thus, through differences in molecular structure, carbohydrates are able to serve the very different functions of energy storage (starch and glycogen) and structural support and protection (cellulose and chitin) (<span class="s32">Figure 2.16</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="503" height="359" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_072.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="625" height="282" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_073.png"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure   2.16   </span>Although   their  structures  and   functions   differ,  all  polysaccharide  carbohydrates  are   made  up  of monosaccharides and have  the chemical formula (CH<span class="s54">2</span>O)<i>n</i>.</p><p class="s16">Registered Dietitian</p><p>Obesity   is  a  worldwide  health  concern, and  many  diseases, such   as diabetes and  heart   disease, are becoming more  prevalent because  of obesity.  This  is  one  of the  reasons why  registered dietitians  are increasingly sought  after  for  advice.   Registered  dietitians   help  plan  food  and   nutrition  programs  for individuals  in various  settings. They  often  work with patients in health-care facilities,  designing  nutrition plans  to  prevent and  treat  diseases. For  example, dietitians  may  teach a  patient  with diabetes how  to manage blood-sugar levels  by eating  the correct  types  and  amounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians  may also work in nursing  homes, schools, and private practices.<br/>To become a  registered dietitian,  one  needs to earn  at  least  a  bachelor’s  degree in dietetics,  nutrition, food technology, or a related field. In addition,  registered dietitians  must  complete a supervised internship program and  pass a  national   exam.   Those who  pursue careers in  dietetics take  courses in  nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry, biology,  microbiology,  and  human physiology.  Dietitians  must  become experts in the chemistry and functions  of food (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).</p><p class="s24">Lipids</p><p>Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are united by a common feature. <b>Lipids </b>are hydrophobic (“water- fearing”), or insoluble in water, because they are nonpolar molecules. This is because they are hydrocarbons that include only nonpolar carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of lipids called fats. Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (<span class="s32">Figure 2.17</span>). For example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry because of their water-repelling nature. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of the plasma membrane. Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                   43</p><p><span><IMG width="348" height="267" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_074.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 2.17 <span class="s30">Hydrophobic lipids in the fur of aquatic mammals, such  as this river otter, protect  them from the elements.

Glycerol is an organic compound with three carbon atoms, five hydrogen atoms, and three hydroxyl (–OH) groups. Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which an acidic carboxyl group is attached, hence the name “fatty acid.” The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36; most common are those containing 12–18 carbons. In a fat molecule, a fatty acid is attached to each of the three oxygen atoms in the –OH groups of the glycerol molecule with a covalent bond (<span class="s32">Figure 2.18</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="504" height="408" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_075.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  2.18  <span class="s30">Lipids include  fats,  such  as triglycerides, which are  made up of fatty acids  and  glycerol,  phospholipids, and steroids.</span></p><p>During this covalent bond formation, three water molecules are released.

For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from <i>Arachis hypogaea</i>, the scientific name for peanuts.<br/>Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is saturated. <b>Saturated fatty acids </b>are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized.<br/>When the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is an <b>unsaturated fatty acid</b>.<br/>Most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are called <b>oils</b>. If there is one double bond in the molecule, then it is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then it is known as a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).<br/>Saturated fats tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic acid contained in meat, and the fat with butyric acid contained in butter, are examples of saturated fats. Mammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell. In plants, fat or oil is stored in seeds and is used as a source of energy during embryonic development.<br/>Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain unsaturated fatty acids. The double bond causes a bend or a “kink” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature. Olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to improve blood cholesterol levels, whereas saturated fats contribute to plaque formation in the arteries, which increases the risk of a heart attack.<br/>In the food industry, oils are artificially hydrogenated to make them semi-solid, leading to less spoilage and increased shelf life. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this hydrogenation process, double bonds of the <i>cis</i>-conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double bonds in the <i>trans</i>-conformation. This forms a <i><b>trans</b></i><b>-fat </b>from a <i>cis</i>-fat. The orientation of the double bonds affects the chemical properties of the fat (<span class="s32">Figure 2.19</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="265" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_076.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure 2.19 </span>During the hydrogenation process, the orientation around the double  bonds is changed, making a <i>trans</i>-fat from a <i>cis</i>-fat. This changes the chemical properties of the molecule.</p><p>Margarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated <i>trans</i>-fats. Recent studies have shown that an increase in <i>trans</i>-fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, which, in turn, may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently eliminated the use of <i>trans</i>-fats, and U.S. food labels are now required to list their <i>trans</i>- fat content.<br/>Essential fatty acids are fatty acids that are required but not synthesized by the human body. Consequently, they must be supplemented through the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids fall into this category and are one of only two known essential fatty acids for humans (the other being omega-6 fatty acids). They are a type of polyunsaturated fat and are called omega-3 fatty acids because the third carbon from the end of the fatty acid participates in a double bond.<br/>Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are important in brain function and normal growth and development. They may also prevent heart disease and reduce the risk of cancer.<br/>Like carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity. It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other “fatty”<br/>foods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Fats serve as long-term energy storage.

Like fats, they are composed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or similar backbone. Instead of three fatty acids attached, however, there are two fatty acids and the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is bound to a phosphate group. The phosphate group is modified by the addition of an alcohol.</span></p><p>A  phospholipid  has  both  hydrophobic  and  hydrophilic  regions.  The  fatty  acid  chains  are  hydrophobic  and  exclude themselves from water, whereas the phosphate is hydrophilic and interacts with water.<br/>Cells are surrounded by a membrane, which has a bilayer of phospholipids. The fatty acids of phospholipids face inside, away from water, whereas the phosphate group can face either the outside environment or the inside of the cell, which are both aqueous.</p><p class="s34">Steroids and Waxes</p><p>Unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier, <b>steroids </b>have a ring structure. Although they do not resemble other lipids, they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic. All steroids have four, linked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail.<br/>Cholesterol is a steroid. Cholesterol is mainly synthesized in the liver and is the precursor of many steroid hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol. It is also the precursor of vitamins E and K. Cholesterol is the precursor of bile salts, which help in the breakdown of fats and their subsequent absorption by cells. Although cholesterol is often spoken of in negative terms, it is necessary for the proper functioning of the body.

Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of different proteins, each with a unique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence.</span></p><p>The functions of proteins are very diverse because there are 20 different chemically distinct amino acids that form long chains, and the amino acids can be in any order. For example, proteins can function as enzymes or hormones. <b>Enzymes</b>, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) upon which it acts. Enzymes can function to break molecular bonds, to rearrange bonds, or to form new bonds. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which breaks down amylose, a component of starch.</p><p class="s27">Hormones <span class="p">are chemical signaling molecules, usually proteins or steroids, secreted by an endocrine gland or group of endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For example, insulin is a protein hormone that maintains blood glucose levels.</span></p><p>Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is critical to its function. Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape</p><p class="s20">46                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life</p><p>of the protein, leading to a loss of function or <b>denaturation </b>(to be discussed in more detail later). All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 kinds of amino acids.<br/><b>Amino acids </b>are the monomers that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists of a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (–NH<span class="s54">2</span>), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogen atom. Every amino acid also has another variable atom or group of atoms bonded to the central carbon atom known as the R group. The R group is the only difference in structure between the 20 amino acids; otherwise, the amino acids are identical (<span class="s32">Figure 2.20</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="298" height="497" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_079.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  2.20  </span>Amino  acids  are  made up  of a  central  carbon bonded to  an  amino  group  (–NH<span class="s54">2</span>),  a  carboxyl  group (–COOH),  and  a hydrogen atom.  The central  carbon’s fourth bond  varies  among the different amino  acids,  as seen in these examples of alanine, valine, lysine, and aspartic acid.</p><p>The chemical nature of the R group determines the chemical nature of the amino acid within its protein (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar).<br/>The sequence and number of amino acids ultimately determine a protein’s shape, size, and function. Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a dehydration reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of a second amino acid combine, releasing a water molecule. The resulting bond is the peptide bond.<br/>The products formed by such a linkage are called polypeptides. While the terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchangeably, a <b>polypeptide </b>is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                   47</p><p class="s16">The Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome c</p><p>Cytochrome c is an  important  component of the  molecular machinery that  harvests energy from glucose. Because this protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has  changed very little over millions of years. Protein  sequencing has  shown  that  there  is a considerable amount of sequence similarity among cytochrome c molecules of different species; evolutionary relationships can  be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among various  species’ protein  sequences.<br/>For example, scientists have  determined that  human cytochrome c contains 104  amino  acids.  For each cytochrome c molecule that has  been sequenced to date  from different organisms, 37 of these amino  acids appear in the same position in each cytochrome c. This indicates that all of these organisms are descended from a  common ancestor.  On  comparing the  human and  chimpanzee protein  sequences, no  sequence difference was found. When human and rhesus monkey  sequences were compared, a single difference was found  in one  amino  acid.  In contrast, human-to-yeast comparisons show  a difference in 44 amino  acids, suggesting that  humans and  chimpanzees have  a  more  recent common ancestor than  humans and  the rhesus monkey,  or humans and yeast.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="297" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_080.png"/></span></p><p class="s34">Protein Structure</p><p>As discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. To understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary (<span class="s32">Figure 2.21</span>).<br/>The unique sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. The unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene that encodes the protein. Any change in the gene sequence may lead to a different amino acid being added to the polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein structure and function. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin β chain has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in both the structure and function of the protein. What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule—that dramatically decreases life expectancy in the affected individuals—is a single amino acid of the 600.<br/>Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, the normally biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood cells assume a crescent or “sickle” shape, which clogs arteries. This can lead to a myriad of serious health problems, such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those who have this disease.<br/>Folding patterns resulting from interactions between the non-R group portions of amino acids give rise to the secondary structure of the protein. The most common are the alpha (α)-helix and beta (β)-pleated sheet structures. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds. In the alpha helix, the bonds form between every fourth amino acid and cause a twist in the amino acid chain.<br/>In the β-pleated sheet, the “pleats” are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the polypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons, and extend above and below the folds of the pleat. The pleated segments align parallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the same pairs of atoms on each of the aligned amino acids. The α-helix and β-pleated sheet structures are found in many globular and fibrous proteins.<br/>The unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is known as its tertiary structure. This structure is caused by chemical interactions between various amino acids and regions of the polypeptide. Primarily, the interactions among R groups create the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. There may be ionic bonds formed between R groups on different amino acids, or hydrogen bonding beyond that involved in the secondary structure. When protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids lay in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups lay on the outside. The former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions.<br/>In nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure. For example, hemoglobin is a combination of four polypeptide subunits.</p><p class="s20">48                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life</p><p><span><IMG width="376" height="501" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_081.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  2.21 <span class="s30">The four levels  of protein  structure can  be observed in these illustrations.

If the protein is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape in what is known as denaturation as discussed earlier. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure is preserved if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to a loss of function. One example of protein denaturation can be seen when an egg is fried or boiled. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan, changing from a clear substance to an opaque white substance. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that are adapted to function at those temperatures.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_083.png"/></span><br/><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/proteins" class="s25">For an additional perspective on proteins, explore “Biomolecules: The Proteins” through this interactive </a><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/proteins" class="s36">animation</a></p><p class="s32">(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/proteins) <span class="p">.</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                   49</p><p class="s24">Nucleic Acids</p><p>Nucleic acids are key macromolecules in the continuity of life.

DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals.<br/>The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus, but instead use an RNA intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. Other types of RNA are also involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.<br/>DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as <b>nucleotides</b>. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide, DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group (<span class="s32">Figure 2.22</span>).

As the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water continually break and reform, allowing for the overall temperature to remain stable, although increased energy is added to the system. Water’s cohesive forces allow for the property of surface tension. All of these unique properties of water are important in the chemistry of living organisms.<br/>The pH of a solution is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. A solution with a high number of hydrogen ions is acidic and has a low pH value. A solution with a high number of hydroxide ions is basic and has a high pH value. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral. Buffers are solutions that moderate pH changes when an acid or base is added to the buffer system. Buffers are important in biological systems because of their ability to maintain constant pH conditions.</p><p class="s52">2.3 Biological Molecules</p><p>Living things are carbon-based because carbon plays such a prominent role in the chemistry of living things. The four covalent bonding positions of the carbon atom can give rise to a wide diversity of compounds with many functions, accounting for the importance of carbon in living things. Carbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell, provide structural support to many organisms, and can be found on the surface of the cell as receptors or for cell recognition. Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, depending on the number of monomers in the molecule.<br/>Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats and oils are a stored form of energy and can include triglycerides. Fats and oils are usually made up of fatty acids and glycerol.<br/>Proteins are a class of macromolecules that can perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers or as hormones. The building blocks of proteins are amino acids. Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature, pH, or chemical exposure may lead to protein denaturation and a loss of function.</p><p class="s20">54                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 2 | Chemistry of Life</p><p>Nucleic acids are molecules made up of repeating units of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell division<br/>and protein synthesis.

What is the basic building block of that wall? It is a single brick, of course. Like a brick wall, your body is composed of basic building blocks, and the building blocks of your body are cells.<br/>Your body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for a specific purpose. Just as a home is made from a variety of building materials, the human body is constructed from many cell types. For example, epithelial cells protect the surface of the body and cover the organs and body cavities within. Bone cells help to support and protect the body. Cells of the immune system fight invading bacteria. Additionally, red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. Each of these cell types plays a vital role during the growth, development, and day-to-day maintenance of the body.

A living thing, like you, is called an organism. Thus, cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms.<br/>In multicellular organisms, several cells of one particular kind interconnect with each other and perform shared functions to form tissues (for example, muscle tissue, connective tissue, and nervous tissue), several tissues combine to form an organ (for example, stomach, heart, or brain), and several organs make up an organ system (such as the digestive system, circulatory system, or nervous system). Several systems functioning together form an organism (such as an elephant, for example).<br/>There are many types of cells, and all are grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Animal cells, plant cells, fungal cells, and protist cells are classified as eukaryotic, whereas bacteria and archaea cells are classified as prokaryotic. Before discussing the criteria for determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, let us first examine how biologists study cells.</p><p class="s24">Microscopy</p><p>Cells vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells are too small to be seen with the naked eye, so scientists use microscopes to study them. A <b>microscope </b>is an instrument that magnifies an object. Most images of cells are taken with a microscope and are called micrographs.</p><p class="s34">Light Microscopes</p><p>To give you a sense of the size of a cell, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers (abbreviated as µm) in diameter; the head of a pin is about two thousandths of a meter (millimeters, or mm) in diameter. That means that approximately 250 red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin.<br/>The optics of the lenses of a light microscope changes the orientation of the image. A specimen that is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing left when viewed through a microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved left while looking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and if moved down, it will seem to move up. This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image. Due to the manner in which light travels through the lenses, this system of lenses produces an inverted image (binoculars and a dissecting microscope work in a similar manner, but include an additional magnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright).<br/>Most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes (<span class="s32">Figure 3.2</span><b>a</b>). Visible light both passes through and is bent by the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains. Staining, however, usually kills the cells.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_089.jpg"/></span><br/>Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times. Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power. Magnification is the degree of enlargement of an object. Resolving power is the ability of a microscope to allow the eye to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate; the higher the resolution, the closer those two objects can be, and the better the clarity and detail of the image. When oil immersion lenses are used, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times for the study of smaller cells, like most prokaryotic cells. Because light entering a specimen from below is focused onto the eye of an observer, the specimen can be viewed using light microscopy. For this reason, for light to pass through a specimen, the sample must be thin or translucent.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_090.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/cell_sizes2" class="s25">For another perspective on cell size, try the </a>HowBig (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/cell_sizes2) <span class="p">interactive.</span></p><p>A second type of microscope used in laboratories is the dissecting microscope (<span class="s32">Figure 3.2</span><b>b</b>). These microscopes have a lower magnification (20 to 80 times the object size) than light microscopes and can provide a three-dimensional view of the specimen. Thick objects can be examined with many components in focus at the same time. These microscopes are designed to give a magnified and clear view of tissue structure as well as the anatomy of the whole organism.

The lens systems are separated by a certain distance, and therefore provide a sense of depth in the view of their subject to make manipulations by hand easier. Dissecting microscopes also have optics that correct the image so that it appears as if being seen by the naked eye and not as an inverted image. The light illuminating a sample under a dissecting microscope typically comes from above the sample, but may also be directed from below.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="308" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_091.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.2 <span class="s30">(a) Most light microscopes used in a college  biology lab can  magnify cells up to approximately 400 times. (b) Dissecting microscopes have  a lower magnification than light microscopes and are used to examine larger objects, such  as tissues.</span></p><p class="s34">Electron Microscopes</p><p>In contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. Not only does this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (<span class="s32">Figure 3.3</span>), it also provides higher resolving power. Preparation of a specimen for viewing under an electron microscope will kill it; therefore, live cells cannot be viewed using this type of microscopy. In addition, the electron beam moves best in a vacuum, making it impossible to view living materials.<br/>In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell’s surface, rendering the details of cell surface characteristics by reflection. Cells and other structures are usually coated with a metal like gold. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam is transmitted through the cell and provides details of a cell’s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than are light microscopes.</p><p class="s20">58                                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function</p><p><span><IMG width="542" height="205" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_092.png"/></span></p><p class="s30">(a)                                                                                      (b)</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="555" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_093.png"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  3.3 </span>(a) <i>Salmonella </i>bacteria are  viewed  with a light microscope.

Despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van Leeuwenhoek observed  the  movements  of  protists  (a  type  of  single-celled  organism)  and  sperm,  which  he  collectively  termed “animalcules.”<br/>In a 1665 publication called <i>Micrographia</i>, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” (from the Latin <i>cella</i>, meaning “small room”) for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens. In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later advances in lenses and microscope construction enabled other scientists to see different components inside cells.<br/>By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the <b>unified cell theory</b>, which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, that the cell is the basic unit of life, and that all new cells arise from existing cells.

The predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (<i>pro</i>- = before; -<i>karyon</i>- = nucleus). Animal cells, plant cells, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes (<i>eu</i>- = true).</p><p class="s24">Components of Prokaryotic Cells</p><p>All cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell’s interior from its surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like region within the cell in which other cellular components are found; 3) DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and 4) ribosomes, particles that synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways.<br/>A <b>prokaryotic cell </b>is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is found in the central part of the cell: a darkened region called the nucleoid (<span class="s32">Figure 3.5</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="348" height="244" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_095.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 3.5 <span class="s30">This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic  cell.</span></p><p class="s20">60                                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function</p><p>Unlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, comprised of sugars and amino acids, and many have a polysaccharide capsule (<span class="s32">Figure 3.5</span>). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion, while most pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation.</p><p class="s24">Eukaryotic Cells</p><p>In nature, the relationship between form and function is apparent at all levels, including the level of the cell, and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells. The principle “form follows function” is found in many contexts. For example, birds and fish have streamlined bodies that allow them to move quickly through the medium in which they live, be it air or water. It means that, in general, one can deduce the function of a structure by looking at its form, because the two are matched.<br/>A <b>eukaryotic cell </b>is a cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound compartments or sacs, called <b>organelles</b>, which have specialized functions. The word eukaryotic means “true kernel” or “true nucleus,” alluding to the presence of the membrane-bound nucleus in these cells. The word “organelle” means “little organ,” and, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have specialized functions.</p><p class="s24">Cell Size</p><p>At 0.1–5.0 µm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging from 10–100 µm (<span class="s32">Figure 3.6</span>). The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly spread to other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly move out. However, larger eukaryotic cells have evolved different structural adaptations to enhance cellular transport. Indeed, the large size of these cells would not be possible without these adaptations. In general, cell size is limited because volume increases much more quickly than does cell surface area. As a cell becomes larger, it becomes more and more difficult for the cell to acquire sufficient materials to support the processes inside the cell, because the relative size of the surface area across which materials must be transported declines.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="328" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_096.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.6 <span class="s30">This figure shows the relative  sizes of different kinds of cells and  cellular components.

A phospholipid is a lipid molecule composed of two fatty acid chains, a glycerol backbone, and a phosphate group. The plasma membrane regulates the passage of some substances, such as organic molecules, ions, and water, preventing the passage of some to maintain internal conditions, while actively bringing in or removing others. Other compounds move passively across the membrane.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="221" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_099.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.8  <span class="s30">The  plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer  with embedded proteins. There  are  other  components, such  as cholesterol and carbohydrates, which can be found in the membrane in addition to phospholipids and protein.</span></p><p>The plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption are folded into fingerlike projections called microvilli (singular<br/>= microvillus). This folding increases the surface area of the plasma membrane. Such cells are typically found lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This is an excellent example of form matching the function of a structure.<br/>People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.</p><p class="s24">The Cytoplasm</p><p>The <b>cytoplasm </b>comprises the contents of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a structure to be discussed shortly). It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel-like <b>cytosol</b>, the cytoskeleton, and various chemicals (<span class="s32">Figure 3.7</span>). Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-solid consistency, which comes from the proteins within it. However, proteins are not the only organic molecules found in the cytoplasm. Glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol are found there too. Ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other elements are also dissolved in the cytoplasm. Many metabolic reactions, including protein synthesis, take place in the cytoplasm.</p><p class="s24">The Cytoskeleton</p><p>If you were to remove all the organelles from a cell, would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be the only components left? No. Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of protein fibers that helps to maintain the shape of the cell, secures certain organelles in specific positions, allows cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enables unicellular organisms to move independently. Collectively, this network of protein fibers is known as the <b>cytoskeleton</b>. There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, also known as actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (<span class="s32">Figure 3.9</span>).</p><p class="s20">64                                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function</p><p><span><IMG width="298" height="381" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_100.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 3.9 <span class="s30">Microfilaments,  intermediate filaments,  and microtubules compose a cell’s cytoskeleton.</span></p><p>Microfilaments are the thinnest of the cytoskeletal fibers and function in moving cellular components, for example, during cell division. They also maintain the structure of microvilli, the extensive folding of the plasma membrane found in cells dedicated to absorption. These components are also common in muscle cells and are responsible for muscle cell contraction. Intermediate filaments are of intermediate diameter and have structural functions, such as maintaining the shape of the cell and anchoring organelles. Keratin, the compound that strengthens hair and nails, forms one type of intermediate filament. Microtubules are the thickest of the cytoskeletal fibers. These are hollow tubes that can dissolve and reform quickly. Microtubules guide organelle movement and are the structures that pull chromosomes to their poles during cell division. They are also the structural components of flagella and cilia. In cilia and flagella, the microtubules are organized as a circle of nine double microtubules on the outside and two microtubules in the center.<br/>The centrosome is a region near the nucleus of animal cells that functions as a microtubule-organizing center. It contains a pair of centrioles, two structures that lie perpendicular to each other. Each centriole is a cylinder of nine triplets of microtubules.<br/>The centrosome replicates itself before a cell divides, and the centrioles play a role in pulling the duplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell. However, the exact function of the centrioles in cell division is not clear, since cells that have the centrioles removed can still divide, and plant cells, which lack centrioles, are capable of cell division.</p><p class="s34">Flagella  and Cilia</p><p><b>Flagella </b>(singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell, (for example, sperm, <i>Euglena</i>). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella. When <b>cilia </b>(singular = cilium) are present, however, they are many in number and extend along the entire surface of the plasma membrane. They are short, hair-like structures that are used to move entire cells (such as paramecium) or move substances along the outer surface of the cell (for example, the cilia of cells lining the fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that move particulate matter toward the throat that mucus has trapped).</p><p class="s24">The Endomembrane System</p><p>The <b>endomembrane system </b>(<i>endo </i>= within) is a group of membranes and organelles (<span class="s32">Figure 3.13</span>) in eukaryotic cells that work together to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins. It includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, and vesicles, the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly. Although not technically <i>within </i>the cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will see, it interacts with the other endomembranous organelles.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function                                                                                                                                                                                                  65</p><p class="s34">The Nucleus</p><p>Typically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell (<span class="s32">Figure 3.7</span>). The <b>nucleus </b>(plural = nuclei) houses the cell’s<br/>DNA in the form of chromatin and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. Let us look at it in more detail (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">3.10<span class="p">).</span></p><p><span><IMG width="348" height="235" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_101.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 3.10 <span class="s30">The outermost boundary of the nucleus is the nuclear envelope. Notice that the nuclear envelope consists of two phospholipid bilayers  (membranes)—an outer  membrane and  an  inner  membrane—in contrast to the  plasma membrane (</span>Figure 3.8<span class="s30">), which consists of only one phospholipid bilayer. (credit: modification of work by NIGMS, NIH)</span></p><p>The <b>nuclear envelope </b>is a double-membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus (<span class="s32">Figure 3.10</span>). Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers.<br/>The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.<br/>To understand chromatin, it is helpful to first consider chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures within the nucleus that are made up of DNA, the hereditary material, and proteins. This combination of DNA and proteins is called chromatin. In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. Every species has a specific number of chromosomes in the nucleus of its body cells. For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, whereas in fruit flies, the chromosome number is eight.<br/>Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, the chromosomes resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch of threads.<br/>We already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this? Some chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly staining area within the nucleus, called the <b>nucleolus </b>(plural<br/>= nucleoli), aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm.</p><p class="s34">The Endoplasmic Reticulum</p><p>The <b>endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 3.13</span>) is a series of interconnected membranous tubules that collectively modify proteins and synthesize lipids. However, these two functions are performed in separate areas of the endoplasmic reticulum: the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.<br/>The hollow portion of the ER tubules is called the lumen or cisternal space. The membrane of the ER, which is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins, is continuous with the nuclear envelope.<br/>The <b>rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) </b>is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface give it a studded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope.<br/>The ribosomes synthesize proteins while attached to the ER, resulting in transfer of their newly synthesized proteins into the lumen of the RER where they undergo modifications such as folding or addition of sugars. The RER also makes phospholipids for cell membranes.<br/>If the phospholipids or modified proteins are not destined to stay in the RER, they will be packaged within vesicles and transported from the RER by budding from the membrane (<span class="s32">Figure 3.13</span>). Since the RER is engaged in modifying proteins that will be secreted from the cell, it is abundant in cells that secrete proteins, such as the liver.</p><p class="s20">66                                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function</p><p>The <b>smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) </b>is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface (see <span class="s32">Figure 3.7</span>). The SER’s functions include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids (including phospholipids), and steroid hormones; detoxification of medications and poisons; alcohol metabolism; and storage of calcium ions.</p><p class="s34">The Golgi  Apparatus</p><p>We have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER, but where do the vesicles go? Before reaching their final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles need to be sorted, packaged, and tagged so that they wind up in the right place. The sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins take place in the <b>Golgi apparatus </b>(also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranous sacs (<span class="s32">Figure 3.11</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="402" height="202" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_102.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.11 <span class="s30">The Golgi apparatus in this transmission electron micrograph of a white blood cell is visible as a stack  of semicircular flattened rings in the lower portion of this image.  Several vesicles can  be seen near  the Golgi apparatus. (credit: modification of work by Louisa Howard; scale-bar data  from Matt Russell)</span></p><p>The Golgi apparatus has a receiving face near the endoplasmic reticulum and a releasing face on the side away from the ER, toward the cell membrane. The transport vesicles that form from the ER travel to the receiving face, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. As the proteins and lipids travel through the Golgi, they undergo further modifications. The most frequent modification is the addition of short chains of sugar molecules. The newly modified proteins and lipids are then tagged with small molecular groups to enable them to be routed to their proper destinations.<br/>Finally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into vesicles that bud from the opposite face of the Golgi. While some of these vesicles, transport vesicles, deposit their contents into other parts of the cell where they will be used, others, secretory vesicles, fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell.<br/>The amount of Golgi in different cell types again illustrates that form follows function within cells. Cells that engage in a great deal of secretory activity (such as cells of the salivary glands that secrete digestive enzymes or cells of the immune system that secrete antibodies) have an abundant number of Golgi.<br/>In plant cells, the Golgi has an additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated into the cell wall and some of which are used in other parts of the cell.</p><p class="s34">Lysosomes</p><p>In animal cells, the <b>lysosomes </b>are the cell’s “garbage disposal.” Digestive enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles. In single-celled eukaryotes, lysosomes are important for digestion of the food they ingest and the recycling of organelles. These enzymes are active at a much lower pH (more acidic) than those located in the cytoplasm. Many reactions that take place in the cytoplasm could not occur at a low pH, thus the advantage of compartmentalizing the eukaryotic cell into organelles is apparent.<br/>Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy disease-causing organisms that might enter the cell. A good example of this occurs in a group of white blood cells called macrophages, which are part of your body’s immune system. In a process known as phagocytosis, a section of the plasma membrane of the macrophage invaginates (folds in) and engulfs a pathogen. The invaginated section, with the pathogen inside, then pinches itself off from the plasma membrane and becomes a vesicle. The vesicle fuses with a lysosome. The lysosome’s hydrolytic enzymes then destroy the pathogen (<span class="s32">Figure 3.12</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function                                                                                                                                                                                                  67</p><p><span><IMG width="348" height="203" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_103.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.12 <span class="s30">A macrophage has  phagocytized a potentially  pathogenic bacterium into a vesicle, which then  fuses with a lysosome within the  cell so  that  the  pathogen can  be  destroyed.

When viewed through an electron microscope, free ribosomes appear as either clusters or single tiny dots floating freely in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes may be attached to either the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (<span class="s32">Figure 3.7</span>). Electron microscopy has shown that ribosomes consist of large and small subunits. Ribosomes are enzyme complexes that are responsible for protein synthesis.<br/>Because protein synthesis is essential for all cells, ribosomes are found in practically every cell, although they are smaller in prokaryotic cells. They are particularly abundant in immature red blood cells for the synthesis of hemoglobin, which functions in the transport of oxygen throughout the body.</p><p class="s24">Mitochondria</p><p><b>Mitochondria </b>(singular = mitochondrion) are often called the “powerhouses” or “energy factories” of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. The formation of ATP from the breakdown of glucose is known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria are oval-shaped, double-membrane organelles (<span class="s32">Figure 3.14</span>) that have their own ribosomes and DNA. Each membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The inner layer has folds called cristae, which increase the surface area of the inner membrane. The area surrounded by the folds is called the mitochondrial matrix. The cristae and the matrix have different roles in cellular respiration.<br/>In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria because muscle cells need a lot of energy to contract.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="232" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_105.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.14  <span class="s30">This transmission electron micrograph shows a mitochondrion as viewed  with an  electron microscope.

Fungal and protist cells also have cell walls.<br/>While the chief component of prokaryotic cell walls is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant cell wall is cellulose, a polysaccharide made up of long, straight chains of glucose units. When nutritional information refers to dietary fiber, it is referring to the cellulose content of food.</p><p class="s34">Chloroplasts</p><p>Like mitochondria, chloroplasts also have their own DNA and ribosomes. <b>Chloroplasts </b>function in photosynthesis and can be found in eukaryotic cells such as plants and algae. In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide, water, and light energy are used to make glucose and oxygen. This is the major difference between plants and animals: Plants (autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like glucose, whereas animals (heterotrophs) must rely on other organisms for their organic compounds or food source.<br/>Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplast’s inner membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked, fluid-filled membrane sacs called thylakoids (<span class="s32">Figure 3.15</span>). Each stack of thylakoids is called a granum (plural = grana).

Endosymbiosis (<i>endo-</i>=   within)  is  a  relationship in which  one  organism lives  inside  the  other.  Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. Microbes  that produce vitamin K live inside the human gut. This relationship is beneficial  for us because we are  unable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial  for the microbes because they are protected from other organisms and are provided  a stable habitat  and abundant food by living within the large intestine.<br/>Scientists have  long  noticed  that  bacteria,  mitochondria, and  chloroplasts are  similar  in size.  We  also know that mitochondria and  chloroplasts have  DNA and  ribosomes, just as bacteria do. Scientists believe that  host  cells  and  bacteria formed  a  mutually  beneficial  endosymbiotic relationship when  the  host  cells ingested aerobic bacteria and  cyanobacteria but did not destroy them.  Through  evolution,  these ingested bacteria became more  specialized in their functions,  with the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the photosynthetic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="318" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_107.png"/></span></p><p class="s34">The Central Vacuole</p><p>Previously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells. If you look at <span class="s32">Figure 3.7</span>, you will see that plant cells each have a large, central vacuole that occupies most of the cell. The <b>central vacuole </b>plays a key role in regulating the cell’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions. In plant cells, the liquid inside the central vacuole provides turgor pressure, which is the outward pressure caused by the fluid inside the cell. Have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days, it wilts? That is because as the water concentration in the soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and cytoplasm and into the soil. As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported. This loss of support to the cell walls of a plant results in the wilted appearance. Additionally, this fluid has a very bitter taste, which discourages consumption by insects and animals. The central vacuole also functions to store proteins in developing seed cells.</p><p class="s24">Extracellular Matrix of Animal Cells</p><p>Most  animal  cells  release  materials  into  the  extracellular  space.  The  primary  components  of  these  materials  are glycoproteins and the protein collagen. Collectively, these materials are called the <b>extracellular matrix </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 3.16</span>). Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function                                                                                                                                                                                                  71</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="348" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_108.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 3.16 <span class="s30">The extracellular matrix consists of a network of substances secreted by cells.</span></p><p>Blood clotting provides an example of the role of the extracellular matrix in cell communication. When the cells lining a blood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor. When tissue factor binds with another factor in the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel, stimulates adjacent smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and initiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors.</p><p class="s24">Intercellular  Junctions</p><p>Cells can also communicate with each other by direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions. There are some differences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this. <b>Plasmodesmata </b>(singular = plasmodesma) are junctions between plant cells, whereas animal cell contacts include tight and gap junctions, and desmosomes.<br/>In general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because they are separated by the cell walls surrounding each cell. Plasmodesmata are numerous channels that pass between the cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connecting their cytoplasm and enabling signal molecules and nutrients to be transported from cell to cell (<span class="s32">Figure 3.17</span><b>a</b>).</p><p class="s20">72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function</p><p><span><IMG width="525" height="422" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_109.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.17  <span class="s30">There  are  four kinds  of connections between cells.

Proteins hold the cells tightly against each other. This tight adhesion prevents materials from leaking between the cells. Tight junctions are typically found in the epithelial tissue that lines internal organs and cavities, and composes most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells lining the urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking into the extracellular space.<br/>Also found only in animal cells are <b>desmosomes</b>, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (<span class="s32">Figure 3.17</span><b>c</b>).

Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities. Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux. The plasma membrane must be sufficiently flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a plasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during early development, and which later plays a role in the “self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response.<br/>The plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specific substances that interact with the cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specific substance. For example, surface receptors of the membrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways. These metabolic pathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specific substances for the cell, or breaking down cellular waste or toxins for disposal. Receptors on the plasma membrane’s exterior surface interact with hormones or neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the cell. Some recognition sites are used by viruses as attachment points. Although they are highly specific, pathogens like viruses may evolve to exploit receptors to gain entry to a cell by mimicking the specific substance that the receptor is meant to bind. This specificity helps to explain why human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any of the five types of hepatitis viruses invade only specific cells.</p><p class="s24">Fluid Mosaic Model</p><p>In 1972, S. J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson proposed a new model of the plasma membrane that, compared to earlier understanding, better explained both microscopic observations and the function of the plasma membrane. This was called the <b>fluid mosaic model</b>. The model has evolved somewhat over time, but still best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them. The fluid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates—in which the components are able to flow and change position, while maintaining the basic integrity of the membrane. Both phospholipid molecules and embedded proteins are able to diffuse rapidly and laterally in the membrane. The fluidity of the plasma membrane is necessary for the activities of certain enzymes and transport molecules within the membrane. Plasma membranes range from 5–10 nm thick. As a comparison, human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 µm thick, or approximately 1,000 times thicker than a plasma membrane.

The amount of cholesterol in animal plasma membranes regulates the fluidity of the membrane and changes based on the temperature of the cell’s environment. In other words, cholesterol acts as antifreeze in the cell membrane and is more abundant in animals that live in cold climates.<br/>The main fabric of the membrane is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules, and the polar ends of these molecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model) (<span class="s32">Figure 3.18</span>) are in contact with aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell. Thus, both surfaces of the plasma membrane are hydrophilic. In contrast, the interior of the membrane, between its two surfaces, is a hydrophobic or nonpolar region because of the fatty acid tails. This region has no attraction for water or other polar molecules.<br/>Proteins make up the second major chemical component of plasma membranes. Integral proteins are embedded in the plasma membrane and may span all or part of the membrane. Integral proteins may serve as channels or pumps to move materials into or out of the cell. Peripheral proteins are found on the exterior or interior surfaces of membranes, attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipid molecules. Both integral and peripheral proteins may serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for the fibers of the cytoskeleton, or as part of the cell’s recognition sites.<br/>Carbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes. They are always found on the exterior surface of cells and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids). These carbohydrate chains may consist of 2–60 monosaccharide units and may be either straight or branched. Along with peripheral proteins, carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="808" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_121.png"/></span></p><p class="s20">76                                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function</p><p class="s16">How Viruses Infect Specific Organs</p><p>Specific  glycoprotein molecules exposed on the surface of the cell membranes of host  cells  are  exploited by many  viruses to infect specific  organs. For example, HIV is able  to penetrate the plasma membranes of specific  kinds of white blood cells called  T-helper  cells and  monocytes, as well as some cells of the central nervous system. The hepatitis virus attacks only liver cells.<br/>These viruses are able to invade  these cells, because the cells have  binding sites  on their surfaces that the viruses have  exploited  with equally  specific  glycoproteins in their coats. (<span class="s32">Figure  3.19</span>).  The  cell is tricked by the  mimicry of the  virus coat  molecules, and  the  virus is able  to enter  the  cell. Other  recognition sites on the virus’s surface interact  with the human immune  system, prompting  the body to produce antibodies. Antibodies  are  made in response to the antigens (or proteins associated with invasive  pathogens). These same sites  serve as places for antibodies to attach, and  either  destroy or inhibit the  activity of the  virus. Unfortunately, these  sites   on  HIV are  encoded by  genes that  change quickly,  making  the  production of an  effective  vaccine against the  virus  very  difficult. The  virus  population  within an  infected  individual quickly evolves through  mutation  into different populations, or variants, distinguished by differences in these recognition sites. This rapid  change of viral surface markers decreases the  effectiveness of the  person’s immune  system in attacking the virus, because the antibodies will not recognize the new  variations of the surface patterns.</p><p class="s29">Figure 3.19 <span class="s30">HIV docks  at and binds to the CD4 receptor, a glycoprotein on the surface of T cells, before  entering, or infecting,  the cell.

In other words, plasma membranes are <b>selectively permeable</b>—they allow some substances through but not others. If they were to lose this selectivity, the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself, and it would be destroyed. Some cells require larger amounts of specific substances than do other cells; they must have a way of obtaining these materials from the extracellular fluids. This may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may have special mechanisms that ensure transport. Most cells expend most of their energy, in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to create and maintain an uneven distribution of ions on the opposite sides of their membranes. The structure of the plasma membrane contributes to these functions, but it also presents some problems.<br/>The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive. <b>Passive transport </b>is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to expend energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration in a process called diffusion. A physical space in which there is a different concentration of a single substance is said to have a <b>concentration gradient</b>.</p><p class="s24">Selective Permeability</p><p>Plasma membranes are asymmetric, meaning that despite the mirror image formed by the phospholipids, the interior of the membrane is not identical to the exterior of the membrane. Integral proteins that act as channels or pumps work in one direction. Carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also found on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. These carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind substances that the cell needs in the extracellular fluid. This adds considerably to the selective nature of plasma membranes.<br/>Recall that plasma membranes have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps the movement of certain materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Lipid-soluble material can easily slip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane. Substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble drugs also gain easy entry into cells and are readily transported into the body’s tissues and organs. Molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide have no charge and pass through by simple diffusion.<br/>Polar substances, with the exception of water, present problems for the membrane. While some polar molecules connect easily with the outside of a cell, they cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the plasma membrane. Additionally, whereas small ions could easily slip through the spaces in the mosaic of the membrane, their charge prevents them from doing so. Ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride must have a special means of penetrating plasma membranes. Simple sugars and amino acids also need help with transport across plasma membranes.</p><p class="s24">Diffusion</p><p><b>Diffusion </b>is a passive process of transport. A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across the space. You are familiar with diffusion of substances through the air. For example, think about someone opening a bottle of perfume in a room filled with people. The perfume is at its highest concentration in the bottle and is at its lowest at the edges of the room. The perfume vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the perfume as it spreads. Materials move within the cell’s cytosol by diffusion, and certain materials move through the plasma membrane by diffusion (<span class="s32">Figure 3.20</span>). Diffusion expends no energy. Rather the different concentrations of materials in different areas are a form of potential energy, and diffusion is the dissipation of that potential energy as materials move down their concentration gradients, from high to low.</p><p class="s20">78                                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function</p><p><span><IMG width="471" height="205" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_123.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.20  <span class="s30">Diffusion through  a permeable membrane follows the concentration gradient of a substance, moving the substance from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration.

Additionally, each substance will diffuse according to that gradient.<br/>Several factors affect the rate of diffusion.<br/>•   Extent of the concentration gradient: The greater the difference in concentration, the more rapid the diffusion. The closer the distribution of the material gets to equilibrium, the slower the rate of diffusion becomes.<br/>•   Mass of the molecules diffusing: More massive molecules move more slowly, because it is more difficult for them to move between the molecules of the substance they are moving through; therefore, they diffuse more slowly.<br/>•   Temperature: Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the movement of the molecules, increasing the rate of diffusion.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_124.jpg"/></span><br/>•   Solvent density: As the density of the solvent increases, the rate of diffusion decreases.

However, the substances that undergo facilitated transport would otherwise not diffuse easily or quickly across the plasma membrane. The solution to moving polar substances and other substances across the plasma membrane rests in the proteins that span its surface. The material being transported is first attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. This allows the material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular fluid. The substances are then passed to specific integral proteins that facilitate their passage, because they form channels or pores that allow certain substances to pass through the membrane. The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins, and they function as either channels for the material or carriers.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function                                                                                                                                                                                                  79</p><p class="s24">Osmosis</p><p><b>Osmosis </b>is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane. Whereas diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells, osmosis transports <i>only water </i>across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water. Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like other substances, moves from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane, separating the two sides or halves (<span class="s32">Figure 3.21</span>). On both sides of the membrane, the water level is the same, but there are different concentrations on each side of a dissolved substance, or <b>solute</b>, that cannot cross the membrane. If the volume of the water is the same, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are also different concentrations of water, the solvent, on either side of the membrane.<br/><span><IMG width="402" height="227" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_126.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.21  <span class="s30">In  osmosis, water  always   moves from  an  area of  higher  concentration (of  water)  to  one  of  lower concentration (of water).

However, only the material capable of getting through the membrane will diffuse through it. In this example, the solute cannot diffuse through the membrane, but the water can. Water has a concentration gradient in this system. Therefore, water will diffuse down its concentration gradient, crossing the membrane to the side where it is less concentrated. This diffusion of water through the membrane—osmosis—will continue until the concentration gradient of water goes to zero.

The measure of the tonicity of a solution, or the total amount of solutes dissolved in a specific amount of solution, is called its <b>osmolarity</b>. Three terms—hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic—are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the cells. In a <b>hypotonic </b>solution, such as tap water, the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes than the fluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the prefix <i>hypo</i>- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than the cell cytoplasm.) It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water than does the cell. In this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell. This may cause an animal cell to burst, or lyse.<br/>In a <b>hypertonic </b>solution (the prefix <i>hyper</i>- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher concentration of solutes than the cell’s cytoplasm), the fluid contains less water than the cell does, such as seawater.

In effect, the solute is drawing the water out of the cell. This may cause an animal cell to shrivel, or crenate.<br/>In an <b>isotonic </b>solution, the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell. If the concentration of solutes of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid, there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell. Blood cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic appearances (<span class="s32">Figure 3.22</span>).</p><p class="s29">Figure  3.22  <span class="s30">Osmotic   pressure changes the  shape of red  blood  cells  in hypertonic, isotonic,  and  hypotonic solutions.

The plasma membrane can only expand to the limit of the cell wall, so the cell will not lyse. In fact, the cytoplasm in plants is always slightly hypertonic compared to the cellular environment, and water will always enter a cell if water is available. This influx of water produces turgor pressure, which stiffens the cell walls of the plant (<span class="s32">Figure 3.23</span>). In nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports the plant. If the plant cells become hypertonic, as occurs in drought or if a plant is not watered adequately, water will leave the cell. Plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt.<br/><span><IMG width="402" height="139" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_130.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.23  <span class="s30">The turgor pressure within a plant cell depends on the tonicity of the solution  that it is bathed in.

If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient, that is, if the concentration of the substance inside the cell must be greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid, the cell must use energy to move the substance. Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight material, such as ions, through the membrane.</span></p><p>In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger molecules and particles. Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy.

Because cells contain proteins, most of which are negatively charged, and because ions move into and out of cells, there is an electrical gradient, a difference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed; at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K<span class="s54">+</span>) and lower concentrations of sodium (Na<span class="s54">+</span>) than does the extracellular fluid. Thus, in a living cell, the concentration gradient and electrical gradient of Na<span class="s54">+ </span>promotes diffusion of the ion into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na<span class="s54">+ </span>(a positive ion) tends to drive it inward to the negatively charged interior. The situation is more complex, however, for other elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K<span class="s54">+ </span>promotes diffusion of the ion <i>into </i>the cell, but the concentration gradient of K<span class="s54">+ </span>promotes diffusion <i>out </i>of the cell (<span class="s32">Figure</span><br/><span class="s32">3.24</span>).

This energy is harvested from ATP that is generated through cellular metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, collectively called pumps or carrier proteins, work against electrochemical gradients. With the exception of ions, small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other substances needed by living cells in the face of these passive changes. Much of a cell’s supply of metabolic energy may be spent maintaining these processes. Because active transport mechanisms depend on cellular metabolism for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the supply of ATP.<br/>Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and macromolecules. Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane. The primary active transport system uses ATP to move a substance, such as an ion, into the cell, and often at the same time, a second substance is moved out of the cell. The sodium-potassium pump, an important pump in animal cells, expends energy to move potassium ions into the cell and a different number of sodium ions out of the cell (<span class="s32">Figure 3.25</span>). The action of this pump results in a concentration and charge difference across the membrane.<br/><span><IMG width="527" height="241" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_133.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  3.25  <span class="s30">The  sodium-potassium pump  move  potassium and  sodium  ions  across the  plasma membrane.

For  example,  when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil removes the invader through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (<span class="s32">Figure 3.26</span>).<br/>A variation of endocytosis is called <b>pinocytosis</b>. This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this process takes in solutes that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid (<span class="s32">Figure 3.26</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_135.jpg"/></span><br/>A targeted variation of endocytosis employs binding proteins in the plasma membrane that are specific for certain substances (<span class="s32">Figure 3.26</span>). The particles bind to the proteins and the plasma membrane invaginates, bringing the substance and the proteins into the cell. If passage across the membrane of the target of <b>receptor-mediated endocytosis </b>is ineffective, it will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by a failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor- mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear the chemical from their blood.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_136.png"/></span><br/><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/endocytosis2" class="s25">See   receptor-mediated   endocytosis   in   action   and   click   on   different   parts   for   a   focused   </a><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/endocytosis2" class="s36">animation</a></p><p class="s32">(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/endocytosis2) <span class="p">to learn more.</span></p><p class="s24">Exocytosis</p><p>In contrast to these methods of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. <b>Exocytosis </b>is the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid.

class="s24">CHAPTER SUMMARY</p><p class="s52">3.1 How Cells  Are Studied</p><p>A cell is the smallest unit of life. Most cells are so small that they cannot be viewed with the naked eye. Therefore, scientists must use microscopes to study cells. Electron microscopes provide higher magnification, higher resolution, and more detail than light microscopes. The unified cell theory states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells.</p><p class="s52">3.2 Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells</p><p>Prokaryotes are predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea. All prokaryotes have plasma membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, a cell wall, DNA, and lack membrane-bound organelles. Many also have polysaccharide capsules. Prokaryotic cells range in diameter from 0.1–5.0 µm.<br/>Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a eukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a membrane), and has other membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of functions. Eukaryotic cells tend to be 10 to 100 times the size of prokaryotic cells.</p><p class="s52">3.3 Eukaryotic Cells</p><p>Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a eukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a membrane), and has other membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of functions. The plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleolus within the nucleus is the site for ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm or are attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. They perform protein synthesis. Mitochondria perform cellular respiration and produce ATP. Peroxisomes break down fatty acids, amino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles and vacuoles are storage and transport compartments. In plant cells, vacuoles also help break down macromolecules.<br/>Animal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes. The centrosome has two bodies, the centrioles, with an unknown role in cell division. Lysosomes are the digestive organelles of animal cells.<br/>Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central vacuole. The plant cell wall, whose primary component is cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. The central vacuole expands, enlarging the cell without the need to produce more cytoplasm.<br/>The endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vesicles, as well as the plasma membrane. These cellular components work together to modify, package, tag, and transport membrane lipids and proteins.<br/>The cytoskeleton has three different types of protein elements. Microfilaments provide rigidity and shape to the cell, and facilitate cellular movements. Intermediate filaments bear tension and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place. Microtubules help the cell resist compression, serve as tracks for motor proteins that move vesicles through the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. They are also the structural elements of centrioles, flagella, and cilia.<br/>Animal cells communicate through their extracellular matrices and are connected to each other by tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. Plant cells are connected and communicate with each other by plasmodesmata.</p><p class="s20">88                                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 3 | Cell Structure and Function</p><p class="s52">3.4 The Cell Membrane</p><p>The modern understanding of the plasma membrane is referred to as the fluid mosaic model. The plasma membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with each other. The landscape of the membrane is studded with proteins, some of which span the membrane. Some of these proteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing surface of the membrane. These form complexes that function to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid nature of the<br/>membrane owes itself to the configuration of the fatty acid tails, the presence of cholesterol embedded in the membrane (in animal cells), and the mosaic nature of the proteins and protein-carbohydrate complexes, which are not firmly fixed in place. Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly<br/>in flux.</p><p class="s52">3.5 Passive Transport</p><p>The passive forms of transport, diffusion and osmosis, move material of small molecular weight. Substances diffuse from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, and this process continues until the substance is evenly distributed in a system. In solutions of more than one substance, each type of molecule diffuses according to its own concentration gradient. Many factors can affect the rate of diffusion, including concentration gradient, the sizes of the particles that are diffusing, and the temperature of the system.<br/>In living systems, diffusion of substances into and out of cells is mediated by the plasma membrane. Some materials<br/>diffuse readily through the membrane, but others are hindered, and their passage is only made possible by protein channels and carriers. The chemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions, and balancing the concentrations of those<br/>solutions is an ongoing problem. In living systems, diffusion of some substances would be slow or difficult without membrane proteins.</p><p class="s52">3.6 Active  Transport</p><p>The combined gradient that affects an ion includes its concentration gradient and its electrical gradient. Living cells need certain substances in concentrations greater than they exist in the extracellular space. Moving substances up their electrochemical gradients requires energy from the cell. Active transport uses energy stored in ATP to fuel the transport. Active transport of small molecular-size material uses integral proteins in the cell membrane to move the material—these proteins are analogous to pumps. Some pumps, which carry out primary active transport, couple directly with ATP to drive their action. In secondary transport, energy from primary transport can be used to move another substance into the cell and up its concentration gradient.<br/>Endocytosis methods require the direct use of ATP to fuel the transport of large particles such as macromolecules; parts of cells or whole cells can be engulfed by other cells in a process called phagocytosis. In phagocytosis, a portion of the membrane invaginates and flows around the particle, eventually pinching off and leaving the particle wholly enclosed by an envelope of plasma membrane. Vacuoles are broken down by the cell, with the particles used as food or dispatched in some other way. Pinocytosis is a similar process on a smaller scale. The cell expels waste and other particles through the reverse process, exocytosis. Wastes are moved outside the cell, pushing a membranous vesicle to the plasma membrane, allowing the vesicle to fuse with the membrane and incorporating itself into the membrane structure, releasing its contents to the exterior of the cell.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 3.7 </span><span class="p">What structures does a plant cell have that an animal cell does not have?

Energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use energy while thinking, and even during sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy. Nutrients and other molecules are imported into the cell, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into new molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and possibly distributed to the entire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are built from smaller molecules imported from dietary amino acids. Complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules as well as the transport of molecules into and out of cells. In addition, processes such as ingesting and breaking down pathogenic bacteria and viruses, exporting wastes and toxins, and movement of the cell require energy. From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer. This chapter will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell are performed with great efficiency.</p><p class="s20">92                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="155" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_140.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">4.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Energy  and Metabolism</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Explain what metabolic pathways are<br/>•   State the first and second laws of thermodynamics<br/>•   Explain the difference between kinetic and potential energy<br/>•   Describe endergonic and exergonic reactions<br/>•   Discuss how enzymes function as molecular catalysts<br/>Scientists use the term <b>bioenergetics </b>to describe the concept of energy flow (<span class="s32">Figure 4.2</span>) through living systems, such as cells. Cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of complex molecules occur through stepwise chemical reactions. Some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release energy, whereas others require energy to proceed. Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish their energy supplies, cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy-requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place. Together, all of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells, including those that consume or generate energy, are referred to as the cell’s <b>metabolism</b>.<br/><span><IMG width="350" height="400" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_141.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 4.2 <span class="s30">Ultimately, most life forms get their energy from the sun.

This is a classic example of one of the many cellular processes that use and produce energy. Living things consume sugars as a major energy source, because sugar molecules have a great deal of energy stored within their bonds. For the most part, photosynthesizing organisms like plants produce these sugars. During photosynthesis, plants use energy (originally from sunlight) to convert carbon dioxide gas (CO<span class="s54">2</span>) into sugar molecules (like glucose: C<span class="s54">6</span>H<span class="s54">12</span>O<span class="s54">6</span>). They consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen as a waste product.

During the light reactions of photosynthesis, energy is provided by a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary energy currency of all cells. Just as the dollar is used as currency to buy goods, cells use molecules of ATP as energy currency to perform immediate work. In contrast, energy-storage molecules such as glucose are consumed only to be broken down to use their energy. The reaction that harvests the energy of a sugar molecule in cells requiring oxygen to survive can be summarized by the reverse reaction to photosynthesis. In this reaction, oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. The reaction is summarized as:</p><p class="s11">C <span class="s10">6 </span>H <span class="s10">12 </span>O <span class="s10">6 </span>+ 6O <span class="s10">2</span>--&gt;6H <span class="s10">2 </span>O + 6CO <span class="s10">2</span></p><p>Both of these reactions involve many steps.<br/>The processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two examples of metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions that takes a starting molecule and modifies it, step-by-step, through a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product. In the example of sugar metabolism, the first metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down into smaller molecules. These two opposite processes—the first requiring energy and the second producing energy—are referred to as <b>anabolic </b>pathways (building polymers) and <b>catabolic </b>pathways (breaking down polymers into their monomers), respectively. Consequently, metabolism is composed of synthesis (anabolism) and degradation (catabolism) (<span class="s32">Figure 4.3</span>).<br/>It is important to know that the chemical reactions of metabolic pathways do not take place on their own. Each reaction step is facilitated, or catalyzed, by a protein called an enzyme. Enzymes are important for catalyzing all types of biological reactions—those that require energy as well as those that release energy.<br/><span><IMG width="530" height="169" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_142.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 4.3 <span class="s30">Catabolic pathways are those that generate energy by breaking down larger molecules. Anabolic pathways are  those that require  energy to synthesize larger  molecules. Both types  of pathways are  required for maintaining the cell’s energy balance.</span></p><p class="s24">Energy</p><p class="s27">Thermodynamics <span class="p">refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter relevant to a particular case of energy transfer is called a system, and everything outside of that matter is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. In an open system, energy can be exchanged with its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost to the air. A closed system cannot exchange energy with its surroundings.</span></p><p>Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings as they use energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis or consume energy-storing molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work and releasing heat. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to physical laws. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.<br/>In general, energy is defined as the ability to do work, or to create some kind of change. Energy exists in different forms. For example, electrical energy, light energy, and heat energy are all different types of energy. To appreciate the way energy flows into and out of biological systems, it is important to understand two of the physical laws that govern energy.</p><p class="s24">Thermodynamics</p><p>The first law of thermodynamics states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant and conserved. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe.

According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may be transferred from place to place or transformed into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and transformations of energy take place around us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light and heat energy. Gas stoves transform chemical energy from natural gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy transformations on earth: that of converting the energy of sunlight to chemical energy stored within organic molecules (<span class="s32">Figure 4.2</span>). Some examples of energy transformations are shown in <span class="s32">Figure 4.4</span>.<br/>The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or transform into usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge. Chemical energy stored within organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transferred and transformed through a series of cellular chemical reactions into energy within molecules of ATP. Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the motion of cilia or flagella, and contracting muscle fibers to create movement.<br/><span><IMG width="396" height="535" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_143.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 4.4 <span class="s30">Shown  are some examples of energy transferred and transformed from one system to another and from one form to another.

However, the second law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. All energy transfers and transformations are never completely efficient. In every energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically, <b>heat energy </b>is defined as the energy transferred from<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy                                                                                                                                                                                                      95</p><p>one system to another that is not work. For example, when a light bulb is turned on, some of the energy being converted from electrical energy into light energy is lost as heat energy. Likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions.<br/>An important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder. The more energy that is lost by a system to its surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is. Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder within a system as entropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy. Molecules and chemical reactions have varying entropy as well. For example, entropy increases as molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out. The second law of thermodynamics says that energy will always be lost as heat in energy transfers or transformations.<br/>Living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to be maintained in a state of low entropy.</p><p class="s24">Potential and Kinetic Energy</p><p>When an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a slow-moving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other objects. Energy associated with objects in motion is called <b>kinetic energy </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 4.5</span>). A speeding bullet, a walking person, and the rapid movement of molecules in the air (which produces heat) all have kinetic energy.<br/>Now what if that same motionless wrecking ball is lifted two stories above ground with a crane? If the suspended wrecking ball is unmoving, is there energy associated with it? The answer is yes. The energy that was required to lift the wrecking ball did not disappear, but is now stored in the wrecking ball by virtue of its position and the force of gravity acting on it. This type of energy is called <b>potential energy </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 4.5</span>). If the ball were to fall, the potential energy would be transformed into kinetic energy until all of the potential energy was exhausted when the ball rested on the ground. Wrecking balls also swing like a pendulum; through the swing, there is a constant change of potential energy (highest at the top of the swing) to kinetic energy (highest at the bottom of the swing). Other examples of potential energy include the energy of water held behind a dam or a person about to skydive out of an airplane.<br/><span><IMG width="505" height="225" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_144.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  4.5 <span class="s30">Still water  has  potential  energy; moving water,  such  as in a waterfall or a rapidly flowing river, has  kinetic energy.

Even a spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed; so does a rubber band that is pulled taut. On a molecular level, the bonds that hold the atoms of molecules together exist in a particular structure that has potential energy. Remember that anabolic cellular pathways require energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones and catabolic pathways release energy when complex molecules are broken down. The fact that energy can be released by the breakdown of certain chemical bonds implies that those bonds have potential energy. In fact, there is potential energy stored within the bonds of all the food molecules we eat, which is eventually harnessed for use. This is because these bonds can release energy when broken. The type of potential energy that exists within chemical bonds, and is released when those bonds are broken, is called chemical energy. Chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food. The release of energy occurs when the molecular bonds within food molecules are broken.</p><p class="s20">96                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy</p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_145.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_146.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/simple_pendulu2" class="s25">Visit the </a>site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/simple_pendulu2) <span class="p">and select “Pendulum” from the “Work and Energy” menu to see the shifting kinetic and potential energy of a pendulum in motion.</span></p><p class="s24">Free and Activation Energy</p><p>After learning that chemical reactions release energy when energy-storing bonds are broken, an important next question is the following: How is the energy associated with these chemical reactions quantified and expressed? How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction? A measurement of free energy is used to quantify these energy transfers. Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve the loss of some amount of energy in an unusable form such as heat. Free energy specifically refers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that is available after the losses are accounted for. In other words, free energy is usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.<br/>If energy is released during a chemical reaction, then the change in free energy, signified as ∆G (delta G) will be a negative number. A negative change in free energy also means that the products of the reaction have less free energy than the reactants, because they release some free energy during the reaction. Reactions that have a negative change in free energy and consequently release free energy are called <b>exergonic reactions</b>. Think: <i>ex</i>ergonic means energy is <i>ex</i>iting the system. These reactions are also referred to as spontaneous reactions, and their products have less stored energy than the reactants. An important distinction must be drawn between the term spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction occurring immediately. Contrary to the everyday use of the term, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. The rusting of iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that occurs slowly, little by little, over time.<br/>If a chemical reaction absorbs energy rather than releases energy on balance, then the ∆G for that reaction will be a positive value. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy-storing molecules. These chemical reactions are called <b>endergonic reactions </b>and they are non- spontaneous. An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy                                                                                                                                                                                                      97</p><p class="s29">Figure  4.6  <span class="s30">Shown   are  some examples of  endergonic processes  (ones that  require   energy) and  exergonic processes (ones that release energy).

Exergonic reactions require a small amount of energy input to get going, before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps. These reactions have a net release of energy, but still require some energy input in the beginning. This small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the <b>activation energy</b>.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_149.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/energy_reactio2" class="s25">Watch an </a>animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/energy_reactio2) <span class="p">of the move from free energy to transition state of the reaction.</span></p><p class="s24">Enzymes</p><p>A substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is called a catalyst, and the molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions are called <b>enzymes</b>.

Without enzymes to speed up these reactions, life could not persist. Enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules and holding them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and -forming processes take place more easily. It is important to remember that enzymes do not change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they do not change the free energy of the reactants or products. They only reduce the activation energy required for the reaction to go forward (<span class="s32">Figure 4.7</span>). In addition, an enzyme itself is unchanged by the reaction it catalyzes. Once one reaction has been catalyzed, the enzyme is able to participate in other reactions.<br/><span><IMG width="348" height="298" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_150.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 4.7 <span class="s30">Enzymes lower the activation  energy of the reaction but do not change the free energy of the reaction.</span></p><p>The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are called the enzyme’s <b>substrates</b>. There may be one or more substrates, depending on the particular chemical reaction. In some reactions, a single reactant substrate is broken down into multiple products. In others, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. Two reactants might also enter a reaction and both become modified, but they leave the reaction as two products. The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme’s <b>active site</b>. The active site is where the “action” happens. Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid side chains within the active site. Each side chain is characterized by different properties. They can be large or small, weakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of side chains creates a very specific chemical environment within the active site. This specific environment is suited to bind to one specific chemical substrate (or substrates).<br/>Active sites are subject to influences of the local environment. Increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction rates, enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise. However, temperatures outside of an optimal range reduce the rate at which an enzyme catalyzes a reaction. Hot temperatures will eventually cause enzymes to denature, an irreversible change in the three-dimensional shape and therefore the function of the enzyme. Enzymes are also suited to function best within a certain pH and salt concentration range, and, as with temperature, extreme pH, and salt concentrations can cause enzymes to denature.<br/>For many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple “lock and key” fashion. This model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step. However, current research supports a model called induced fit (<span class="s32">Figure 4.8</span>). The induced-fit model expands on the lock-and-key model by describing a more dynamic binding between enzyme and substrate. As the enzyme and substrate come together, their interaction causes a mild shift in the enzyme’s structure that forms an ideal binding arrangement between enzyme and substrate.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy                                                                                                                                                                                                      99</p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_151.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_152.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hexokinase2" class="s25">View an </a>animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hexokinase2) <span class="p">of induced fit.</span></p><p>When an enzyme binds its substrate, an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. This complex lowers the activation energy of the reaction and promotes its rapid progression in one of multiple possible ways. On a basic level, enzymes promote chemical reactions that involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation for reaction. Another way in which enzymes promote the reaction of their substrates is by creating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur. The chemical properties that emerge from the particular arrangement of amino acid R groups within an active site create the perfect environment for an enzyme’s specific substrates to react.<br/>The enzyme-substrate complex can also lower activation energy by compromising the bond structure so that it is easier to break. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical reaction itself. In these cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will always return to its original state by the completion of the reaction. One of the hallmark properties of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze. After an enzyme has catalyzed a reaction, it releases its product(s) and can catalyze a new reaction.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="178" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_153.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  4.8  <span class="s30">The  induced-fit  model  is  an  adjustment to  the  lock-and-key model  and  explains how  enzymes and substrates undergo dynamic  modifications during  the  transition  state to increase the  affinity of the  substrate for the active site.</span></p><p>It would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all of an organism&#39;s enzymes existed in abundant supply and functioned optimally under all cellular conditions, in all cells, at all times. However, a variety of mechanisms ensures that this does not happen. Cellular needs and conditions constantly vary from cell to cell, and change within individual cells over time. The required enzymes of stomach cells differ from those of fat storage cells, skin cells, blood cells, and nerve cells. Furthermore, a digestive organ cell works much harder to process and break down nutrients during the time that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal. As these cellular demands and conditions vary, so must the amounts and functionality of different enzymes.<br/>Since the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine activation energies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a cell ultimately determine which reactions will proceed and at what rates. This determination is tightly controlled in cells. In certain cellular environments, enzyme activity is partly controlled by environmental factors like pH, temperature, salt concentration, and, in some cases, cofactors or coenzymes.<br/>Enzymes can also be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce enzyme activity. There are many kinds of molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms by which they do so. In some cases of enzyme inhibition, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding. When this happens, the enzyme is inhibited through <b>competitive inhibition</b>, because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for binding to the active site.</p><p class="s20">100                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy</p><p>On the other hand, in <b>noncompetitive inhibition</b>, an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than the active site, called an allosteric site, but still manages to block substrate binding to the active site. Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. This type of inhibition is called <b>allosteric inhibition </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 4.9</span>). Most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide, meaning that they have more than one protein subunit. When an allosteric inhibitor binds to a region on an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits are changed slightly such that they bind their substrates with less efficiency. There are allosteric activators as well as inhibitors. Allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from the active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme’s active site(s) for its substrate(s) (<span class="s32">Figure 4.9</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="305" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_154.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  4.9  <span class="s30">Allosteric inhibition works  by indirectly inducing  a conformational change to the  active  site  such  that  the substrate no longer fits.

Understanding how enzymes work and how they can be regulated are key principles  behind  the development of many of the pharmaceutical drugs  on the market today.  Biologists working in this field collaborate with other  scientists to design drugs  (<span class="s32">Figure 4.10</span>).<br/>Consider statins for example—statins is the name given to one  class of drugs  that can  reduce cholesterol levels.  These compounds are  inhibitors  of the  enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which  is the  enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol from lipids in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the level of cholesterol synthesized in the body can  be reduced. Similarly, acetaminophen, popularly  marketed under  the brand  name Tylenol, is an inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. While it is used to provide  relief from fever and  inflammation (pain), its mechanism of action is still not completely understood.<br/>How are  drugs  discovered? One  of the biggest challenges in drug discovery is identifying a drug target. A drug target  is a molecule that is literally the target  of the drug.  In the case of statins, HMG-CoA reductase is the  drug  target. Drug  targets are  identified  through  painstaking research in the  laboratory.  Identifying the target  alone  is not enough; scientists also  need to know how the target  acts  inside  the cell and  which reactions go awry in the  case of disease. Once  the  target  and  the  pathway are  identified,  then  the  actual process of drug design begins. In this stage, chemists and biologists  work together to design and synthesize molecules that can  block or activate a particular  reaction. However,  this is only the beginning:  If and  when a drug  prototype is successful in performing  its function,  then  it is subjected to many  tests from in vitro experiments to clinical trials before  it can get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  to be on the market.<br/>Many enzymes do not work optimally, or even at all, unless bound to other specific non-protein helper molecules. They may bond either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds, or permanently through stronger covalent bonds. Binding to these molecules promotes optimal shape and function of their respective enzymes. Two examples of these types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes. Cofactors are inorganic ions such as ions of iron and magnesium. Coenzymes are organic helper molecules, those with a basic atomic structure made up of carbon and hydrogen. Like enzymes, these molecules participate in reactions without being changed themselves and are ultimately recycled and reused. Vitamins are the source of coenzymes. Some vitamins are the precursors of coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes. Vitamin C is a direct coenzyme for multiple enzymes that take part in building the important connective tissue, collagen. Therefore, enzyme function is, in part, regulated by the abundance of various cofactors and coenzymes, which may be supplied by an organism’s diet or, in some cases, produced by the organism.</p><p class="s34">Feedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways</p><p>Molecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways. The major question remains, however: What are these molecules and where do they come from? Some are cofactors and coenzymes, as you have learned. What other molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and non-competitive inhibition?

Additionally, ATP is an allosteric regulator of some of the enzymes involved in the catabolic breakdown of sugar, the process that creates ATP. In this way, when ATP is in abundant supply, the cell can prevent the production of ATP. On the other hand, ADP serves as a positive allosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes that are inhibited by ATP. Thus, when relative levels of ADP are high compared to ATP, the cell is triggered to produce more ATP through sugar catabolism.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="90" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_157.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">4.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Glycolysis</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Explain how ATP is used by the cell as an energy source<br/>•   Describe the overall result in terms of molecules produced of the breakdown of glucose by glycolysis<br/>Even exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy to proceed. However, consider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input because their products have more free energy than their reactants. Within the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from? The answer lies with an energy-supplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or <b>ATP</b>. ATP is a small, relatively simple molecule, but within its bonds contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work. This molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for things they need. ATP is used to power the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.</p><p class="s24">ATP in Living Systems</p><p>A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy. Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell, which would denature enzymes and other proteins, and thus destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells accomplish this using ATP, which can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions as a rechargeable battery.<br/>When ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. This energy is used to do work by the cell, usually by the binding of the released phosphate to another molecule, thus activating it. For example, in the mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies energy to move the contractile muscle proteins.</p><p class="s34">ATP Structure and Function</p><p>At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to both a ribose molecule and a single phosphate group (<span class="s32">Figure 4.12</span>). Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in RNA and AMP is one of the nucleotides in RNA. The addition of a second phosphate group to this core molecule results in adenosine <u>di</u>phosphate (ADP); the addition of a third phosphate group forms adenosine <u>tri</u>phosphate (ATP).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy                                                                                                                                                                                                    103</p><p><span><IMG width="378" height="223" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_158.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  4.12  <span class="s30">The  structure of ATP shows the  basic  components of a two-ring adenine, five-carbon ribose,  and  three phosphate groups.</span></p><p>The addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires a high amount of energy and results in a high-energy bond. Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one another when they are arranged in series, as they are in ADP and ATP. This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable. The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP, a process called hydrolysis, releases energy.</p><p class="s24">Glycolysis</p><p>You have read that nearly all of the energy used by living things comes to them in the bonds of the sugar, glucose. <b>Glycolysis </b>is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cell metabolism. Many living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of most prokaryotic and all eukaryotic cells.<br/>Glycolysis begins with the six-carbon, ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. In the first part of the glycolysis pathway, energy is used to make adjustments so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. In the second part of glycolysis, ATP and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are produced (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">4.13<span class="p">).</span></p><p>If the cell cannot catabolize the pyruvate molecules further, it will harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose.

If oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward. In mitochondria, pyruvate will be transformed into a two-carbon acetyl group (by removing a molecule of carbon dioxide) that will be picked up by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA), which is made from vitamin B<span class="s54">5</span>. The resulting compound is called <b>acetyl CoA</b>. (<span class="s32">Figure 4.14</span>). Acetyl CoA can be used in a variety of ways by the cell, but its major function is to deliver the acetyl group derived from pyruvate to the next pathway in glucose catabolism.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy                                                                                                                                                                                                    105</p><p><span><IMG width="449" height="186" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_161.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 4.14 <span class="s30">Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA  before  entering the citric acid cycle.</span></p><p>Like the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the <b>citric acid cycle </b>in eukaryotic cells takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop: The last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step. The eight steps of the cycle are a series of chemical reactions that produces two carbon dioxide molecules, one ATP molecule (or an equivalent), and reduced forms (NADH and FADH<span class="s54">2</span>) of NAD<span class="s54">+ </span>and FAD<span class="s54">+</span>, important coenzymes in the cell. Part of this is considered an aerobic pathway (oxygen-requiring) because the NADH and FADH<span class="s54">2 </span>produced must transfer their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen. If oxygen is not present, this transfer does not occur.<br/>Two carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group. Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not contain the same carbon atoms contributed by the acetyl group on that turn of the pathway. The two acetyl-carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the cycle; in this way, all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule will be eventually released as carbon dioxide. It takes two turns of the cycle to process the equivalent of one glucose molecule. Each turn of the cycle forms three high-energy NADH molecules and one high-energy FADH<span class="s54">2 </span>molecule. These high-energy carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration to produce ATP molecules. One ATP (or an equivalent) is also made in each cycle. Several of the intermediate compounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing non-essential amino acids; therefore, the cycle is both anabolic and catabolic.</p><p class="s24">Oxidative Phosphorylation</p><p>You have just read about two pathways in glucose catabolism—glycolysis and the citric acid cycle—that generate ATP. Most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from these pathways. Rather, it derives from a process that begins with passing electrons through a series of chemical reactions to a final electron acceptor, oxygen. These reactions take place in specialized protein complexes located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic organisms and on the inner part of the cell membrane of prokaryotic organisms. The energy of the electrons is harvested and used to generate a electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The potential energy of this gradient is used to generate ATP. The entirety of this process is called <b>oxidative phosphorylation</b>.<br/>The electron transport chain (<span class="s32">Figure 4.15</span><b>a</b>) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of metabolism that uses atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen continuously diffuses into plants for this purpose. In animals, oxygen enters the body through the respiratory system. Electron transport is a series of chemical reactions that resembles a bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next, to the endpoint of the chain where oxygen is the final electron acceptor and water is produced. There are four complexes composed of proteins, labeled I through IV in <span class="s32">Figure 4.15</span><b>c</b>, and the aggregation of these four complexes, together with associated mobile, accessory electron carriers, is called the <b>electron transport chain</b>. The electron transport chain is present in multiple copies in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes. In each transfer of an electron through the electron transport chain, the electron loses energy, but with some transfers, the energy is stored as potential energy by using it to pump hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient.</p><p class="s20">106                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy</p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  4.15  </span>(a) The  electron transport chain  is a set  of molecules that  supports a series of oxidation-reduction reactions.

What affect would cyanide have  on ATP synthesis?<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="689" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_162.png"/></span><br/>Electrons from NADH and FADH<span class="s54">2 </span>are passed to protein complexes in the electron transport chain. As they are passed from one complex to another (there are a total of four), the electrons lose energy, and some of that energy is used to pump hydrogen ions from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. In the fourth protein complex, the electrons are accepted by oxygen, the terminal acceptor. The oxygen with its extra electrons then combines with two hydrogen ions, further enhancing the electrochemical gradient, to form water. If there were no oxygen present in the mitochondrion, the electrons could not be removed from the system, and the entire electron transport chain would back up and stop. The mitochondria would be unable to generate new ATP in this way, and the cell would ultimately die from lack of energy. This is the reason we must breathe to draw in new oxygen.<br/>In the electron transport chain, the free energy from the series of reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions across the membrane. The uneven distribution of H<span class="s54">+ </span>ions across the membrane establishes an electrochemical gradient, owing to the H<span class="s54">+ </span>ions’ positive charge and their higher concentration on one side of the membrane.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy                                                                                                                                                                                                    107</p><p>Hydrogen ions diffuse through the inner membrane through an integral membrane protein called <b>ATP synthase </b>(<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s27"><span style=" color: #C63;">4.15</span>b<span class="p">). This complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down their electrochemical gradient from the intermembrane space, where there are many mutually repelling hydrogen ions to the matrix, where there are few. The turning of the parts of this molecular machine regenerate ATP from ADP. This flow of hydrogen ions across the membrane through ATP synthase is called </span>chemiosmosis<span class="p">.</span></p><p>Chemiosmosis (<span class="s32">Figure 4.15</span><b>c</b>) is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during aerobic glucose catabolism. The result of the reactions is the production of ATP from the energy of the electrons removed from hydrogen atoms. These atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. At the end of the electron transport system, the electrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions. The extra electrons on the oxygen ions attract hydrogen ions (protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is formed. The electron transport chain and the production of ATP through chemiosmosis are collectively called oxidative phosphorylation.</p><p class="s24">ATP Yield</p><p>The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. For example, the number of hydrogen ions that the electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between species. Another source of variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the mitochondrial membrane. The NADH generated from glycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria. Thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of the mitochondria by either NAD<span class="s54">+ </span>or FAD<span class="s54">+</span>. Fewer ATP molecules are generated when FAD<span class="s54">+ </span>acts as a carrier. NAD<span class="s54">+ </span>is used as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD<span class="s54">+ </span>in the brain, so ATP yield depends on the tissue being considered.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="261" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_163.png"/></span><br/>Another factor that affects the yield of ATP molecules generated from glucose is that intermediate compounds in these pathways are used for other purposes. Glucose catabolism connects with the pathways that build or break down all other biochemical compounds in cells, and the result is somewhat messier than the ideal situations described thus far. For example, sugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway for energy extraction. Other molecules that would otherwise be used to harvest energy in glycolysis or the citric acid cycle may be removed to form nucleic acids, amino acids, lipids, or other compounds. Overall, in living systems, these pathways of glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained in glucose.</p><p class="s16">Mitochondrial Disease Physician</p><p>What  happens when  the  critical reactions of cellular  respiration do  not  proceed  correctly?

Many prokaryotes are facultatively anaerobic. This means that they can switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of oxygen. Certain prokaryotes, like <i>Clostridia </i>bacteria, are obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen. Oxygen is a poison to these microorganisms and kills them upon exposure. It should be noted that all forms of fermentation, except lactic acid fermentation, produce gas. The production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the fermentation of specific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria. The various methods of fermentation are used by different organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD<span class="s54">+ </span>for the sixth step in glycolysis. Without these pathways, that step would not occur, and no ATP would be harvested from the breakdown of glucose.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="106" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_171.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">4.5 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Connections to Other Metabolic  Pathways</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Discuss the way in which carbohydrate metabolic pathways, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle interrelate with protein and lipid metabolic pathways<br/>•   Explain why metabolic pathways are not considered closed systems<br/>You have learned about the catabolism of glucose, which provides energy to living cells. But living things consume more than just glucose for food. How does a turkey sandwich, which contains protein, provide energy to your cells? This happens because all of the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids eventually connect into glycolysis and the citric acid cycle pathways (<span class="s32">Figure 4.20</span>). Metabolic pathways should be thought of as porous—that is, substances enter from other pathways, and other substances leave for other pathways. These pathways are not closed systems. Many of the products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways.</p><p class="s24">Connections of Other Sugars to Glucose Metabolism</p><p>Glycogen, a polymer of glucose, is a short-term energy storage molecule in animals. When there is adequate ATP present, excess glucose is converted into glycogen for storage. Glycogen is made and stored in the liver and muscle. Glycogen will be taken out of storage if blood sugar levels drop. The presence of glycogen in muscle cells as a source of glucose allows ATP to be produced for a longer time during exercise.<br/>Sucrose is a disaccharide made from glucose and fructose bonded together. Sucrose is broken down in the small intestine, and the glucose and fructose are absorbed separately. Fructose is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose (which is part of milk sugar, the disaccharide lactose), that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. The catabolism of both fructose and galactose produces the same number of ATP molecules as glucose.</p><p class="s24">Connections of Proteins to Glucose Metabolism</p><p>Proteins are broken down by a variety of enzymes in cells. Most of the time, amino acids are recycled into new proteins. If there are excess amino acids, however, or if the body is in a state of famine, some amino acids will be shunted into pathways of glucose catabolism. Each amino acid must have its amino group removed prior to entry into these pathways. The amino group is converted into ammonia. In mammals, the liver synthesizes urea from two ammonia molecules and a carbon dioxide molecule. Thus, urea is the principal waste product in mammals from the nitrogen originating in amino acids, and it leaves the body in urine.</p><p class="s20">112                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy</p><p class="s24">Connections of Lipids to Glucose Metabolism</p><p>The lipids that are connected to the glucose pathways are cholesterol and triglycerides. Cholesterol is a lipid that contributes to cell membrane flexibility and is a precursor of steroid hormones. The synthesis of cholesterol starts with acetyl CoA and proceeds in only one direction. The process cannot be reversed, and ATP is not produced.<br/>Triglycerides are a form of long-term energy storage in animals. Triglycerides store about twice as much energy as carbohydrates. Triglycerides are made of glycerol and three fatty acids. Animals can make most of the fatty acids they need. Triglycerides can be both made and broken down through parts of the glucose catabolism pathways. Glycerol can be phosphorylated and proceeds through glycolysis. Fatty acids are broken into two-carbon units that enter the citric acid cycle.<br/><span><IMG width="402" height="176" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_172.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="625" height="357" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_173.png"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  4.20  <span class="s30">Glycogen from  the  liver  and  muscles, together with  fats,  can  feed  into  the  catabolic pathways for carbohydrates.</span></p><p class="s16">Pathways of Photosynthesis and Cellular Metabolism</p><p>Photosynthesis and  cellular metabolism consist of several very complex  pathways. It is generally thought that  the  first  cells  arose in  an  aqueous  environment—a “soup”  of  nutrients. If  these cells  reproduced successfully and their numbers climbed steadily, it follows that the cells would begin to deplete the nutrients from the  medium  in which they  lived, as they  shifted  the  nutrients into their  own cells.  This  hypothetical situation  would have  resulted in natural  selection favoring  those organisms that  could  exist  by using  the nutrients that  remained in their environment and  by manipulating these nutrients into materials that  they could use  to survive.  Additionally, selection would favor those organisms that could extract  maximal  value from the available nutrients.<br/>An early  form of photosynthesis developed that  harnessed the  sun’s energy using  compounds other  than water  as a  source of hydrogen atoms, but  this  pathway did not  produce free  oxygen.  It is thought  that glycolysis developed prior to this time and could take advantage of simple sugars being produced, but these reactions were not able to fully extract  the energy stored in the carbohydrates. A later form of photosynthesis used water  as a source of hydrogen ions and  generated free oxygen.  Over time, the atmosphere became oxygenated. Living things  adapted to exploit this new  atmosphere and  allowed  respiration as we know it to evolve.  When  the full process of photosynthesis as we know it developed and  the atmosphere became oxygenated, cells  were  finally able  to use  the  oxygen  expelled by photosynthesis to extract  more  energy from the sugar molecules using the citric acid cycle.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 4 | How Cells Obtain Energy                                                                                                                                                                                                    113</p><p class="s24">KEY TERMS</p><p class="s27">acetyl CoA  <span class="p">the combination of an acetyl group derived from pyruvic acid and coenzyme A which is made  from pantothenic acid (a B-group vitamin)</span></p><p class="s27">activation energy  <span class="p">the amount of initial energy necessary for reactions to occur</span></p><p class="s27">active site   <span class="p">a specific region on the enzyme where the substrate binds</span></p><p class="s27">allosteric inhibition <span class="p">the mechanism for inhibiting enzyme action in which a regulatory molecule binds to a second site</span></p><p>(not the active site) and initiates a conformation change in the active site, preventing binding with the substrate</p><p class="s27">anabolic <span class="p">describes the pathway that requires a net energy input to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones</span></p><p class="s27">anaerobic cellular  respiration <span class="p">the use of an electron acceptor other than oxygen to complete metabolism  using electron transport-based chemiosmosis</span></p><p class="s27">ATP  <span class="p">(also, adenosine triphosphate) the cell’s energy currency</span></p><p class="s27">ATP synthase <span class="p">a membrane-embedded protein complex that regenerates ATP from ADP with energy from  protons diffusing through it</span></p><p class="s27">bioenergetics <span class="p">the concept of energy flow through living systems</span></p><p class="s27">catabolic <span class="p">describes the pathway in which complex molecules are broken down into simpler ones, yielding energy as an additional product of the reaction</span></p><p class="s27">chemiosmosis <span class="p">the movement of hydrogen ions down their electrochemical gradient across a membrane through ATP</span></p><p>synthase to generate ATP</p><p class="s27">citric acid cycle <span class="p">a series of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions of central importance in all living cells that harvests the energy in carbon-carbon bonds of sugar molecules to generate ATP;

A cell’s metabolism refers to the combination of chemical reactions that take place within it. Catabolic reactions break down complex chemicals into simpler ones and are associated with energy release. Anabolic processes build complex molecules out of simpler ones and require energy.<br/>In studying energy, the term system refers to the matter and environment involved in energy transfers. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. The physical laws that describe the transfer of energy are the laws of thermodynamics. The first law states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. The second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy. Energy comes in different forms: kinetic, potential, and free. The change in free energy of a reaction can be negative (releases energy, exergonic) or positive (consumes energy, endergonic). All reactions require an initial input of energy to proceed, called the activation energy.<br/>Enzymes are chemical catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by lowering their activation energy. Enzymes have an active site with a unique chemical environment that fits particular chemical reactants for that enzyme, called substrates. Enzymes and substrates are thought to bind according to an induced-fit model. Enzyme action is regulated to conserve resources and respond optimally to the environment.</p><p class="s52">4.2 Glycolysis</p><p>ATP functions as the energy currency for cells. It allows cells to store energy briefly and transport it within itself to support endergonic chemical reactions. The structure of ATP is that of an RNA nucleotide with three phosphate groups attached. As ATP is used for energy, a phosphate group is detached, and ADP is produced. Energy derived from glucose catabolism is used to recharge ADP into ATP.<br/>Glycolysis is the first pathway used in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy. Because it is used by nearly all organisms on earth, it must have evolved early in the history of life. Glycolysis consists of two parts: The first part prepares the six-carbon ring of glucose for separation into two three-carbon sugars. Energy from ATP is invested into the molecule during this step to energize the separation. The second half of glycolysis extracts ATP and high-energy electrons from hydrogen atoms and attaches them to NAD<span class="s54">+</span>. Two ATP molecules are invested in the first half and four ATP molecules are formed during the second half. This produces a net gain of two ATP molecules per molecule of glucose for the cell.</p><p class="s52">4.3 Citric Acid Cycle  and Oxidative Phosphorylation</p><p>The citric acid cycle is a series of chemical reactions that removes high-energy electrons and uses them in the electron transport chain to generate ATP. One molecule of ATP (or an equivalent) is produced per each turn of the cycle.<br/>The electron transport chain is the portion of aerobic respiration that uses free oxygen as the final electron acceptor for electrons removed from the intermediate compounds in glucose catabolism. The electrons are passed through a series of chemical reactions, with a small amount of free energy used at three points to transport hydrogen ions across the membrane. This contributes to the gradient used in chemiosmosis. As the electrons are passed from NADH or FADH<span class="s54">2 </span>down the electron transport chain, they lose energy. The products of the electron transport chain are water and ATP.

The carbohydrates that can also feed into glucose catabolism include galactose, fructose, and glycogen. These connect with glycolysis. The amino acids from proteins connect with glucose catabolism through pyruvate, acetyl CoA, and<br/>components of the citric acid cycle. Cholesterol synthesis starts with acetyl CoA, and the components of triglycerides are picked up by acetyl CoA and enter the citric acid cycle.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 4.6 </span><span class="p">Look at each of the processes shown and decide if it is endergonic or exergonic.</span></p><p class="s27">2. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 4.15 </span><span class="p">Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, a component of the electron transport chain.

An <b>autotroph </b>is an organism that can produce its own food. The Greek roots of the word <i>autotroph </i>mean “self” (<i>auto</i>) “feeder” (<i>troph</i>). Plants are the best-known autotrophs, but others exist, including certain types of bacteria and algae (<span class="s32">Figure 5.2</span>). Oceanic algae contribute enormous quantities of food and oxygen to global food chains. Plants are also <b>photoautotrophs</b>, a type of autotroph that uses sunlight and carbon from carbon dioxide to synthesize chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. All organisms carrying out photosynthesis require sunlight.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="134" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_179.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  5.2 <span class="s30">(a) Plants, (b) algae, and  (c) certain  bacteria, called  cyanobacteria, are  photoautotrophs that can  carry out photosynthesis.

The Greek roots of the word <i>heterotroph </i>mean “other” (<i>hetero</i>) “feeder” (<i>troph</i>), meaning that their food comes from other organisms. Even if the food organism is another animal, this food traces its origins back to autotrophs and the process of photosynthesis. Humans are heterotrophs, as are all animals. Heterotrophs depend on autotrophs, either directly or indirectly. Deer and wolves are heterotrophs. A deer obtains energy by eating plants. A wolf eating a deer obtains energy that originally came from the plants eaten by that deer. The energy in the plant came from photosynthesis, and therefore it is the only autotroph in this example (<span class="s32">Figure 5.3</span>). Using this reasoning, all food eaten by humans also links back to autotrophs that carry out photosynthesis.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 5 | Photosynthesis                                                                                                                                                                                     119</p><p><span><IMG width="348" height="232" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_180.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="625" height="481" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_181.png"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  5.3  <span class="s30">The  energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes  through  the  food  chain.

Before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the physical structures involved.<br/>In plants, photosynthesis takes place primarily in leaves, which consist of many layers of cells and have differentiated top and bottom sides. The process of photosynthesis occurs not on the surface layers of the leaf, but rather in a middle layer called the <b>mesophyll </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 5.7</span>). The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called <b>stomata</b>.<br/>In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a <b>chloroplast</b>. In plants, chloroplast- containing cells exist in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double (inner and outer) membrane. Within the chloroplast is a third membrane that forms stacked, disc-shaped structures called <b>thylakoids</b>. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are molecules of <b>chlorophyll</b>, a <b>pigment </b>(a molecule that absorbs light) through which the entire process of photosynthesis begins. Chlorophyll is responsible for the green color of plants. The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid space.

In the <b>light-dependent reactions</b>, which take place at the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy with the use of water. The light-dependent reactions release oxygen from the hydrolysis of water as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules. The two reactions use carrier molecules to transport the energy from one to the other. The carriers that move energy from the light-dependent reactions to the Calvin cycle reactions can be thought of as “full” because they bring energy. After the energy is released, the “empty” energy carriers return to the light-dependent reactions to obtain more energy.</p><p class="s20">122                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 5 | Photosynthesis</p><p class="s23">5.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>The Light-Dependent Reactions of</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_185.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">Photosynthesis</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Explain how plants absorb energy from sunlight<br/>•   Describe how the wavelength of light affects its energy and color<br/>•   Describe how and where photosynthesis takes place within a plant<br/>How can light be used to make food?

Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its <b>wavelength</b>, the distance between two consecutive, similar points in a series of waves, such as from crest to crest or trough to trough (<span class="s32">Figure 5.9</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="348" height="232" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_189.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 5.9 <span class="s30">The wavelength of a single wave is the distance between two consecutive points along the wave.</span></p><p>Visible light constitutes only one of many types of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun. The <b>electromagnetic spectrum </b>is the range of all possible wavelengths of radiation (<span class="s32">Figure 5.10</span>). Each wavelength corresponds to a different amount of energy carried.<br/><span><IMG width="503" height="244" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_190.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure   5.10   <span class="s30">The  sun   emits   energy  in  the  form  of  electromagnetic  radiation.  This  radiation   exists   in  different wavelengths, each of which has  its own characteristic energy. Visible light is one type of energy emitted  from the sun.</span></p><p>Each type of electromagnetic radiation has a characteristic range of wavelengths. The longer the wavelength (or the more stretched out it appears), the less energy is carried. Short, tight waves carry the most energy. This may seem illogical, but think of it in terms of a piece of moving rope. It takes little effort by a person to move a rope in long, wide waves. To make a rope move in short, tight waves, a person would need to apply significantly more energy.<br/>The sun emits (<span class="s32">Figure 5.10</span>) a broad range of electromagnetic radiation, including X-rays and ultraviolet (UV) rays. The higher-energy waves are dangerous to living things; for example, X-rays and UV rays can be harmful to humans.</p><p class="s24">Absorption of Light</p><p>Light energy enters the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light. In plants, pigment molecules absorb only visible light for photosynthesis. The visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors. Certain objects, such as a prism or a drop of water, disperse white light to reveal these colors to the human eye. The visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is perceived by the human eye as a rainbow of colors, with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths and, therefore, higher energy. At the other end of the spectrum toward red, the wavelengths are longer and have lower energy.</p><p class="s20">124                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 5 | Photosynthesis</p><p class="s24">Understanding Pigments</p><p>Different kinds of pigments exist, and each absorbs only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect the color of the wavelengths that they cannot absorb.<br/>All photosynthetic organisms contain a pigment called <b>chlorophyll </b><i><b>a</b></i>, which humans see as the common green color associated with plants. Chlorophyll <i>a </i>absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not from green. Because green is reflected, chlorophyll appears green.<br/>Other pigment types include <b>chlorophyll </b><i><b>b </b></i>(which absorbs blue and red-orange light) and the carotenoids. Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is its <b>absorption spectrum</b>.<br/>Many photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments; between them, the organism can absorb energy from a wider range of visible-light wavelengths. Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. Some organisms grow underwater where light intensity decreases with depth, and certain wavelengths are absorbed by the water. Other organisms grow in competition for light. Plants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees block most of the sunlight (<span class="s32">Figure 5.11</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="348" height="232" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_191.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  5.11  <span class="s30">Plants that commonly  grow in the shade benefit  from having  a variety of light-absorbing pigments.

This chemical energy will be used by the Calvin cycle to fuel the assembly of sugar molecules.<br/>The light-dependent reactions begin in a grouping of pigment molecules and proteins called a <b>photosystem</b>. Photosystems exist in the membranes of thylakoids. A pigment molecule in the photosystem absorbs one <b>photon</b>, a quantity or “packet” of light energy, at a time.<br/>A photon of light energy travels until it reaches a molecule of chlorophyll. The photon causes an electron in the chlorophyll to become “excited.” The energy given to the electron allows it to break free from an atom of the chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll is therefore said to “donate” an electron (<span class="s32">Figure 5.12</span>).<br/>To replace the electron in the chlorophyll, a molecule of water is split. This splitting releases an electron and results in the formation of oxygen (O<span class="s54">2</span>) and hydrogen ions (H<span class="s54">+</span>) in the thylakoid space. Technically, each breaking of a water molecule releases a pair of electrons, and therefore can replace two donated electrons.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 5 | Photosynthesis                                                                                                                                                                                     125</p><p><span><IMG width="400" height="338" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_192.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  5.12  <span class="s30">Light energy is absorbed by a chlorophyll molecule and  is passed along  a pathway to other  chlorophyll molecules. The energy culminates in a molecule of chlorophyll found in the reaction center. The energy “excites” one of its electrons enough to leave  the molecule and  be transferred to a nearby primary electron acceptor. A molecule of water  splits to release an electron, which is needed to replace the one  donated. Oxygen  and  hydrogen ions are  also formed from the splitting of water.</span></p><p>The replacing of the electron enables chlorophyll to respond to another photon. The oxygen molecules produced as byproducts find their way to the surrounding environment. The hydrogen ions play critical roles in the remainder of the light-dependent reactions.<br/>Keep in mind that the purpose of the light-dependent reactions is to convert solar energy into chemical carriers that will be used in the Calvin cycle. In eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, two photosystems exist. The first is called photosystem II, which was named for the order of its discovery rather than for the order of the function.<br/>After the photon hits, photosystem II transfers the free electron to the first in a series of proteins inside the thylakoid membrane called the electron transport chain. As the electron passes along these proteins, energy from the electron fuels membrane pumps that actively move hydrogen ions against their concentration gradient from the stroma into the thylakoid space. This is quite analogous to the process that occurs in the mitochondrion in which an electron transport chain pumps hydrogen ions from the mitochondrial stroma across the inner membrane and into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. After the energy is used, the electron is accepted by a pigment molecule in the next photosystem, which is called photosystem I (<span class="s32">Figure 5.13</span>).</p><p class="s20">126                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 5 | Photosynthesis</p><p><span><IMG width="449" height="269" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_193.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  5.13  <span class="s30">From  photosystem II, the  electron travels  along  a  series of proteins.

The energy that these molecules carry is stored in a bond that holds a single atom to the molecule. For ATP, it is a phosphate atom, and for NADPH, it is a hydrogen atom. Recall that NADH was a similar molecule that carried energy in the mitochondrion from the citric acid cycle to the electron transport chain. When these molecules release energy into the Calvin cycle, they each lose atoms to become the lower-energy molecules ADP and NADP<span class="s54">+</span>.<br/>The buildup of hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space forms an electrochemical gradient because of the difference in the concentration of protons (H<span class="s54">+</span>) and the difference in the charge across the membrane that they create. This potential energy is harvested and stored as chemical energy in ATP through chemiosmosis, the movement of hydrogen ions down their electrochemical gradient through the transmembrane enzyme ATP synthase, just as in the mitochondrion.<br/>The hydrogen ions are allowed to pass through the thylakoid membrane through an embedded protein complex called ATP synthase. This same protein generated ATP from ADP in the mitochondrion. The energy generated by the hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP in a process called photophosphorylation. The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis, because the ions move from an area of high to low concentration through a semi-permeable structure.</p><p class="s24">Generating Another  Energy  Carrier: NADPH</p><p>The remaining function of the light-dependent reaction is to generate the other energy-carrier molecule, NADPH. As the electron from the electron transport chain arrives at photosystem I, it is re-energized with another photon captured by chlorophyll. The energy from this electron drives the formation of NADPH from NADP<span class="s54">+ </span>and a hydrogen ion (H<span class="s54">+</span>).

The <b>Calvin cycle </b>is the term used for the reactions of photosynthesis that use the energy stored by the light-dependent reactions to form glucose and other carbohydrate molecules.</p><p class="s24">The Interworkings of the Calvin Cycle</p><p>In  plants,  carbon  dioxide  (CO<span class="s54">2</span>)  enters  the  chloroplast  through  the  stomata  and  diffuses  into  the  stroma  of  the chloroplast—the site of the Calvin cycle reactions where sugar is synthesized. The reactions are named after the scientist who discovered them, and reference the fact that the reactions function as a cycle. Others call it the Calvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery (<span class="s32">Figure 5.14</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="352" height="322" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_195.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  5.14  <span class="s30">Light-dependent reactions harness  energy from the  sun  to produce ATP and  NADPH. These energy- carrying molecules travel into the stroma where  the Calvin cycle reactions take place.</span></p><p>The Calvin cycle reactions (<span class="s32">Figure 5.15</span>) can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and regeneration. In the stroma, in addition to CO<span class="s54">2</span>, two other chemicals are present to initiate the Calvin cycle: an enzyme abbreviated RuBisCO, and the molecule ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). RuBP has five atoms of carbon and a phosphate group on each end.<br/>RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO<span class="s54">2 </span>and RuBP, which forms a six-carbon compound that is immediately converted into two three-carbon compounds. This process is called <b>carbon fixation</b>, because CO<span class="s54">2 </span>is “fixed” from its inorganic form into organic molecules.<br/>ATP and NADPH use their stored energy to convert the three-carbon compound, 3-PGA, into another three-carbon compound called G3P. This type of reaction is called a reduction reaction, because it involves the gain of electrons. A reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule. The molecules of ADP and NAD<span class="s54">+</span>, resulting from the reduction reaction, return to the light-dependent reactions to be re-energized.<br/>One of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle to contribute to the formation of the carbohydrate molecule, which is commonly glucose (C<span class="s54">6</span>H<span class="s54">12</span>O<span class="s54">6</span>). Because the carbohydrate molecule has six carbon atoms, it takes six turns of the Calvin cycle to make one carbohydrate molecule (one for each carbon dioxide molecule fixed). The remaining G3P molecules regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for the carbon-fixation step. ATP is also used in the regeneration of RuBP.</p><p class="s20">128                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 5 | Photosynthesis</p><p><span><IMG width="449" height="374" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_196.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  5.15 <span class="s30">The Calvin cycle has  three  stages.

Even  between the  giant  tropical  leaves in the  rainforest and  tiny cyanobacteria, the process and  components of photosynthesis that use  water  as an electron donor  remain largely the same. Photosystems function to absorb light and use  electron transport chains to convert  energy. The Calvin cycle reactions assemble carbohydrate molecules with this energy.<br/>However,  as with all biochemical pathways, a variety  of conditions leads to varied  adaptations that  affect the  basic  pattern. Photosynthesis in dry-climate  plants  (<span class="s32">Figure  5.16</span>)  has  evolved  with adaptations that conserve water.  In the  harsh dry heat, every  drop  of water  and  precious energy must  be  used to survive. Two adaptations have  evolved  in such  plants.  In one  form, a  more  efficient  use  of CO<span class="s54">2  </span>allows  plants  to photosynthesize even  when CO<span class="s54">2  </span>is in short  supply,  as when the stomata are  closed on hot days.  The other adaptation performs preliminary reactions of the Calvin cycle at night, because opening the stomata at this time conserves water due to cooler temperatures. In addition, this adaptation has  allowed plants  to carry out low levels  of photosynthesis without opening stomata at all, an extreme mechanism to face  extremely dry periods.</p><p class="s29">Figure  5.16  <span class="s30">Living in the  harsh conditions of the  desert has  led  plants  like this  cactus to evolve  variations in reactions outside the  Calvin  cycle.

However, prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, lack membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotic photosynthetic  autotrophic  organisms  have  infoldings  of  the  plasma  membrane  for  chlorophyll  attachment  and photosynthesis (<span class="s32">Figure 5.17</span>). It is here that organisms like cyanobacteria can carry out photosynthesis.</p><p class="s20">130                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 5 | Photosynthesis</p><p><span><IMG width="348" height="289" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_200.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  5.17  <span class="s30">A photosynthetic prokaryote has  infolded  regions of the  plasma membrane that  function  like thylakoids.

However, if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down? Carbohydrates are storage molecules for energy in all living things. Although energy can be stored in molecules like ATP, carbohydrates are much more stable and efficient reservoirs for chemical energy. Photosynthetic organisms also carry out the reactions of respiration to harvest the energy that they have stored in carbohydrates, for example, plants have mitochondria in addition to chloroplasts.<br/>You may have noticed that the overall reaction for photosynthesis:</p><p class="s11">6CO <span class="s10">2 </span>+ 6H <span class="s10">2 </span>O <span class="s6">⎯→ </span>C <span class="s10">6 </span>H <span class="s10">12 </span>O <span class="s10">6 </span>+ 6O <span class="s10">2</span></p><p>is the reverse of the overall reaction for cellular respiration:</p><p class="s11">6O <span class="s10">2 </span>+ C <span class="s10">6 </span>H <span class="s10">12 </span>O <span class="s10">6  </span>→ 6CO <span class="s10">2 </span>+ 6H <span class="s10">2 </span>O</p><p>Photosynthesis produces oxygen as a byproduct, and respiration produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct.<br/>In nature, there is no such thing as waste. Every single atom of matter is conserved, recycling indefinitely. Substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another, but never disappear (<span class="s32">Figure 5.18</span>).<br/>CO<span class="s54">2  </span>is no more a form of waste produced by respiration than oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis. Both are byproducts of reactions that move on to other reactions. Photosynthesis absorbs energy to build carbohydrates in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular respiration releases energy by using oxygen to break down carbohydrates. Both organelles use electron transport chains to generate the energy necessary to drive other reactions. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration function in a biological cycle, allowing organisms to access life-sustaining energy that originates millions of miles away in a star.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 5 | Photosynthesis                                                                                                                                                                                     131</p><p><span><IMG width="352" height="294" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_201.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 5.18 <span class="s30">In the carbon cycle, the reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration share reciprocal reactants and products.

By harnessing energy from the sun, photosynthesis allowed living things to access enormous amounts of energy. Because of photosynthesis, living things gained access to sufficient energy, allowing them to evolve new structures and achieve the biodiversity that is evident today.<br/>Only certain organisms, called autotrophs, can perform photosynthesis; they require the presence of chlorophyll, a specialized pigment that can absorb light and convert light energy into chemical energy. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble carbohydrate molecules (usually glucose) and releases oxygen into the air. Eukaryotic autotrophs, such as plants and algae, have organelles called chloroplasts in which photosynthesis takes place.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 5 | Photosynthesis                                                                                                                                                                                     133</p><p class="s52">5.2 The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis</p><p>In the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reaction, pigment molecules absorb energy from sunlight. The most common and abundant pigment is chlorophyll <i>a</i>. A photon strikes photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. Energy travels through the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space. This forms an electrochemical gradient. The ions flow through ATP synthase from the thylakoid space into the stroma in a process called chemiosmosis<br/>to form molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy carrier for the Calvin cycle reactions.</p><p class="s52">5.3 The Calvin Cycle</p><p>Using the energy carriers formed in the first stage of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle reactions fix CO<span class="s54">2 </span>from the environment to build carbohydrate molecules. An enzyme, RuBisCO, catalyzes the fixation reaction, by combining CO<span class="s54">2 </span>with RuBP. The resulting six-carbon compound is broken down into two three-carbon compounds, and the energy in ATP and NADPH is used to convert these molecules into G3P. One of the three-carbon molecules of G3P leaves the cycle to become a part of a carbohydrate molecule. The remaining G3P molecules stay in the cycle to be formed back into RuBP, which is ready to react with more CO<span class="s54">2</span>. Photosynthesis forms a balanced energy cycle with the process of cellular respiration. Plants are capable of both photosynthesis and cellular respiration, since they contain both chloroplasts and mitochondria.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 5.7 </span><span class="p">On a hot, dry day, plants close their stomata to conserve water.

Once a human individual is fully grown, cell reproduction is still necessary to repair or regenerate tissues. For example, new blood and skin cells are constantly being produced.

The region in the cell containing this genetic material is called a nucleoid. Some prokaryotes also have smaller loops of DNA called plasmids that are not essential for normal growth.<br/>In eukaryotes, the genome comprises several double-stranded, linear DNA molecules (<span class="s32">Figure 6.2</span>) bound with proteins to form complexes called chromosomes.

Human cells that contain one set of 23 chromosomes are called <b>gametes</b>, or sex cells; these eggs and sperm are designated <i>n</i>, or <b>haploid</b>.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="253" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_205.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  6.2  <span class="s30">There  are  23 pairs  of homologous chromosomes in a female  human somatic cell.

Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called <b>genes </b>in exactly the same location, or <b>locus</b>. Genes, the functional units of chromosomes, determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins. Traits are the different forms of a characteristic. For example, the shape of earlobes is a characteristic with traits of free or attached.<br/>Each copy of the homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent; therefore, the copies of each of the genes themselves may not be identical. The variation of individuals within a species is caused by the specific combination of the genes inherited from both parents. For example, there are three possible gene sequences on the human chromosome that codes for blood type: sequence A, sequence B, and sequence O. Because all diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood type (the trait) is determined by which two versions of the marker gene are inherited. It is possible to have two copies of the same gene sequence, one on each homologous chromosome (for example, AA, BB, or OO), or two different sequences, such as AB.<br/>Minor variations in traits such as those for blood type, eye color, and height contribute to the natural variation found within a species. The sex chromosomes, X and Y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous chromosomes; other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to reliably produce gametes, the genes found on the X and Y chromosomes are not the same.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 6 | Reproduction at the Cellular Level                                                                                                                                                                                    137</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="150" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_206.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">6.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>The Cell Cycle</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the three stages of interphase<br/>•   Discuss the behavior of chromosomes during mitosis and how the cytoplasmic content divides during cytokinesis<br/>•   Define the quiescent G<span class="s54">0 </span>phase<br/>•   Explain how the three internal control checkpoints occur at the end of G<span class="s54">1</span>, at the G<span class="s54">2</span>–M transition, and during metaphase<br/>The <b>cell cycle </b>is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication, and division that produce two genetically identical cells. The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase (<span class="s32">Figure 6.3</span>). During <b>interphase</b>, the cell grows and DNA is replicated.

In the <b>S phase </b>(synthesis phase), DNA replication results in the formation of two identical copies of each chromosome—sister chromatids—that are firmly attached at the centromere region. At this stage, each chromosome is made of two sister chromatids and is a duplicated chromosome. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes will give rise to the <b>mitotic spindle</b>, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. The centrosome consists of a pair of rod-like <b>centrioles </b>at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division.

The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and moved to opposite poles of the cell, and then the cell is divided into two new identical daughter cells. The first portion of the mitotic phase, <b>mitosis</b>, is composed of five stages, which accomplish nuclear division. The second portion of the mitotic phase, called cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells.</p><p class="s34">Mitosis</p><p>Mitosis is divided into a series of phases—prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase—that result in the division of the cell nucleus (<span class="s32">Figure 6.4</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 6 | Reproduction at the Cellular Level                                                                                                                                                                                    139</p><p class="s29">Figure  6.4 <span class="s30">Animal cell mitosis  is divided into five stages—prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase—visualized here  by light microscopy with fluorescence.

Although the stages of mitosis are similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant cells.</span></p><p>In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis begins following the onset of anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure, or “crack,” is called the <b>cleavage furrow</b>. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane and cell are cleaved in two (<span class="s32">Figure 6.5</span>).<br/>In plant cells, a cleavage furrow is not possible because of the rigid cell walls surrounding the plasma membrane. A new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking up into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell. During telophase, these Golgi vesicles move on microtubules to collect at the metaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a <b>cell plate</b>. As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell wall at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall of cellulose. The Golgi membranes become the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall (<span class="s32">Figure 6.5</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 6 | Reproduction at the Cellular Level                                                                                                                                                                                    141</p><p><span><IMG width="348" height="348" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_211.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 6.5 <span class="s30">In part (a), a cleavage furrow forms at the former metaphase plate in the animal cell.

Despite the redundancy and overlapping levels of cell-cycle control, errors occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the cell-cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of the cell-cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. If one of these changes to the DNA nucleotide sequence occurs within a gene, a gene mutation results. All cancers begin when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that participates in the process of cell reproduction. The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor. Even minor mistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, small, uncorrected errors are passed from parent cell to daughter cells and accumulate as each generation of cells produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage. Eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor can result.</p><p class="s24">Proto-oncogenes</p><p>The genes that code for the positive cell-cycle regulators are called <b>proto-oncogenes</b>. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that, when mutated, become <b>oncogenes</b>—genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a less functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing the cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward. If a cell cannot reproduce, the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene mutation causes a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator. For example, a mutation that allows Cdk, a protein involved in cell-cycle regulation, to be activated before it should be could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met. If the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undertake further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated and no harm comes to the organism. However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to divide further, the subsequent generation of cells will likely accumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle.<br/>The Cdk example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the cell-cycle regulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell-cycle checkpoints. Once a proto-oncogene has been altered such that there is an increase in the rate of the cell cycle, it is then called an oncogene.</p><p class="s20">144                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 6 | Reproduction at the Cellular Level</p><p class="s24">Tumor Suppressor Genes</p><p>Like proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell-cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous.  <b>Tumor  suppressor  genes  </b>are  genes  that  code  for  the  negative  regulator  proteins,  the  type  of  regulator that—when activated—can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. The collective function of the best- understood tumor suppressor gene proteins, retinoblastoma protein (RB1), p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell- cycle progress until certain events are completed. A cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem.<br/>Mutated p53 genes have been identified in more than half of all human tumor cells.

The p53 protein activates other genes whose products halt the cell cycle (allowing time for DNA repair), activates genes whose products participate in DNA repair, or activates genes that initiate cell death when DNA damage cannot be repaired. A damaged p53 gene can result in the cell behaving as if there are no mutations (<span class="s32">Figure 6.8</span>). This allows cells to divide, propagating the mutation in daughter cells and allowing the accumulation of new mutations. In addition, the damaged version of p53 found in cancer cells cannot trigger cell death.<br/><span><IMG width="505" height="378" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_217.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_218.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 6.8 <span class="s30">(a) The role of p53 is to monitor DNA.

For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to produce new individuals. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals.<br/>To achieve the outcome of identical daughter cells, some steps are essential. The genomic DNA must be replicated and then allocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to sustain life. In bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular DNA chromosome; therefore, the process of cell division is simplified. Mitosis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus or multiple chromosomes. This type of cell division is called binary fission.</p><p class="s24">Binary Fission</p><p>The cell division process of prokaryotes, called <b>binary fission</b>, is a less complicated and much quicker process than cell division in eukaryotes. Because of the speed of bacterial cell division, populations of bacteria can grow very rapidly. The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell. As in eukaryotes, the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to some of the proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes.<br/>The starting point of replication, the <b>origin</b>, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (<span class="s32">Figure 6.9</span>). Replication of the DNA is bidirectional—moving away from the origin on both strands of the DNA loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell-wall attachment toward opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. A <b>septum </b>is formed between the nucleoids from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.</p><p class="s20">146                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 6 | Reproduction at the Cellular Level</p><p><span><IMG width="424" height="640" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_221.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure   6.9   <span class="s30">The   binary   fission   of   a   bacterium  is   outlined   in   five   steps.

Prokaryotic cells,  on  the  other  hand, do  not  undergo mitosis  and  therefore have  no  need for a  mitotic spindle.  However,  the FtsZ protein  that plays  such  a vital role in prokaryotic  cytokinesis is structurally  and functionally  very similar to tubulin, the  building block of the  microtubules that  make  up the  mitotic spindle fibers that are  necessary for eukaryotes. The formation  of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called  <b>FtsZ </b>directs  the  partition  between the  nucleoids in prokaryotes. Formation of the  FtsZ  ring triggers the  accumulation of other  proteins that  work together to  recruit  new  membrane and  cell-wall materials to  the  site.  FtsZ  proteins can  form  filaments,   rings,  and  other  three-dimensional structures resembling the  way  tubulin  forms  microtubules, centrioles, and  various  cytoskeleton components. In addition,  both FtsZ and  tubulin employ  the same energy source, GTP (guanosine triphosphate), to rapidly assemble and disassemble complex  structures.<br/>FtsZ and tubulin are an example of homology,  structures derived  from the same evolutionary origins. In this example, FtsZ is presumed to be similar to the ancestor protein  to both the modern FtsZ and  tubulin. While both  proteins are  found  in extant  organisms, tubulin  function  has  evolved  and  diversified  tremendously since  the  evolution  from its FtsZ-like prokaryotic  origin. A survey  of cell-division machinery in present-day unicellular  eukaryotes reveals crucial  intermediary steps to the  complex  mitotic machinery of multicellular eukaryotes (<span class="s32">Table 6.1</span>).</p><p class="s52">Structure of</p><p class="s60">Mitotic Spindle Evolution</p><p class="s52">Separation of</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="883" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_222.png"/></span></p><p class="s52">genetic material                       Division of nuclear material</p><p class="s52">daughter cells</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s19">Prokaryotes</p></td><td><p class="s19">There  is no nucleus.

Human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes consisting of two sets of 22 homologous chromosomes<br/>and a pair of nonhomologous sex chromosomes. This is the 2<i>n, </i>or diploid, state. Human gametes have 23 chromosomes or one complete set of chromosomes. This is the <i>n, </i>or haploid, state. Genes are segments of DNA that code for a specific protein or RNA molecule. An organism’s traits are determined in large part by the genes inherited from each parent, but also by the environment that they experience. Genes are expressed as characteristics of the organism and each characteristic may have different variants called traits that are caused by differences in the DNA sequence for a gene.</p><p class="s52">6.2 The Cell Cycle</p><p>The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory period, called interphase. Interphase is divided into G<span class="s54">1</span>, S, and G<span class="s54">2 </span>phases. Mitosis consists of five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Mitosis is usually accompanied by cytokinesis, during which the cytoplasmic components of the daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring (animal cells) or by cell plate formation (plant cells).<br/>Each step of the cell cycle is monitored by internal controls called checkpoints. There are three major checkpoints in the cell cycle: one near the end of G<span class="s54">1</span>, a second at the G<span class="s54">2</span>–M transition, and the third during metaphase.</p><p class="s52">6.3 Cancer  and the Cell Cycle</p><p>Cancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of the mechanisms regulating the cell cycle. The loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. Faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should. Any disruption of the monitoring system can allow other mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells. Each successive cell division will give rise to daughter cells with even more accumulated damage. Eventually, all checkpoints become nonfunctional, and rapidly reproducing cells crowd out normal cells, resulting in tumorous growth.</p><p class="s52">6.4 Prokaryotic Cell Division</p><p>In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division, the genomic DNA is replicated and each copy is allocated into a daughter cell. The cytoplasmic contents are also divided evenly to the new cells. However, there are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division. Bacteria have a single, circular DNA chromosome and no nucleus. Therefore, mitosis is not necessary in bacterial cell division.

Hippopotamuses give birth to hippopotamus calves; Monterey pine trees produce seeds from which Monterey pine seedlings emerge; and adult flamingos lay eggs that hatch into flamingo chicks. <i>In kind </i>does not generally mean <i>exactly the same</i>. While many single-celled organisms and a few multicellular organisms can produce genetically identical clones of themselves through mitotic cell division, many single-celled organisms and most multicellular organisms reproduce regularly using another method.<br/>Sexual reproduction is the production by parents of haploid cells and the fusion of a haploid cell from each parent to form a single, unique diploid cell. In multicellular organisms, the new diploid cell will then undergo mitotic cell divisions to develop into an adult organism. A type of cell division called meiosis leads to the haploid cells that are part of the sexual reproductive cycle. Sexual reproduction, specifically meiosis and fertilization, introduces variation into offspring that may account for the evolutionary success of sexual reproduction. The vast majority of eukaryotic organisms can or must employ some form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="91" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_226.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">7.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Sexual Reproduction</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Explain that variation among offspring is a potential evolutionary advantage resulting from sexual reproduction<br/>•   Describe the three different life-cycle strategies among sexual multicellular organisms and their commonalities<br/>Sexual reproduction was an early evolutionary innovation after the appearance of eukaryotic cells. The fact that most eukaryotes reproduce sexually is evidence of its evolutionary success. In many animals, it is the only mode of reproduction.</p><p class="s20">154                                                                                                                                                                                      Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance</p><p>And yet, scientists recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. On the surface, offspring that are genetically identical to the parent may appear to be more advantageous. If the parent organism is successfully occupying a habitat, offspring with the same traits would be similarly successful. There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that can produce offspring by asexual budding, fragmentation, or asexual eggs. These methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex. There is no need to expend energy finding or attracting a mate. That energy can be spent on producing more offspring. Indeed, some organisms that lead a solitary lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually. In addition, asexual populations only have female individuals, so every individual is capable of reproduction. In contrast, the males in sexual populations (half the population) are not producing offspring themselves. Because of this, an asexual population can grow twice as fast as a sexual population in theory. This means that in competition, the asexual population would have the advantage. All of these advantages to asexual reproduction, which are also disadvantages to sexual reproduction, should mean that the number of species with asexual reproduction should be more common.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="459" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_227.png"/></span><br/>However, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare. Why is sexual reproduction so common? This is one of the important questions in biology and has been the focus of much research from the latter half of the twentieth century until now. A likely explanation is that the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and reproduction of those offspring. The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. This is the ultimate source of variation in sexual organisms. In addition, those different mutations are continually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes, and the genes are mixed into different combinations by the process of <b>meiosis</b>. Meiosis is the division of the contents of the nucleus that divides the chromosomes among gametes. Variation is introduced during meiosis, as well as when the gametes combine in fertilization.</p><p class="s16">The Red Queen Hypothesis</p><p>There  is no question that sexual reproduction provides evolutionary advantages to organisms that employ this  mechanism to produce offspring.  The  problematic question is why,  even  in the  face  of fairly stable conditions, sexual reproduction persists when  it is more  difficult and  produces fewer offspring for individual organisms? Variation  is the  outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are  ongoing  variations necessary?</p><p class="s55">[1]</p><p>Enter  the Red  Queen hypothesis, first proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.<br/>The concept was  named in<br/>reference to the  Red  Queen&#39;s race  in Lewis Carroll&#39;s  book,  <i>Through  the  Looking-Glass, </i>in which the  Red<br/>Queen says one must run at full speed just to stay where  one is.<br/>All species coevolve with other  organisms. For example, predators coevolve with their prey,  and  parasites coevolve with their  hosts. A remarkable example of coevolution between predators and  their  prey  is the unique  coadaptation of night flying bats  and  their moth  prey.  Bats  find their prey  by emitting  high-pitched clicks, but moths  have  evolved  simple ears to hear  these clicks so they can avoid the bats.  The moths  have also  adapted behaviors, such  as flying away  from the  bat  when  they  first hear  it, or dropping  suddenly to the ground  when  the bat is upon  them.  Bats  have  evolved  “quiet” clicks in an attempt to evade the moth’s hearing. Some moths  have  evolved  the  ability to respond to the  bats’  clicks  with their  own  clicks  as a strategy to confuse the bats  echolocation abilities.<br/>Each   tiny  advantage  gained by  favorable variation  gives  a  species an  edge over  close   competitors, predators, parasites, or even  prey.  The  only method that  will allow a coevolving  species to keep  its own share of the  resources is also  to continually  improve  its ability to survive  and  produce offspring.  As one species gains  an advantage, other species must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted. No single  species progresses too far ahead because genetic variation  among progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to produce adapted individuals.  Species whose individuals  cannot keep  up become extinct. The Red  Queen’s catchphrase was,  “It takes all the running  you can  do to stay  in the same place.” This is an apt description of coevolution between competing species.</p><p class="s24">Life Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms</p><p>Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual <b>life cycles</b>.

The gametes are produced from diploid <b>germ cells</b>, a special cell line that only produces gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. There is no multicellular haploid life stage.

During sexual reproduction, specialized haploid cells from two individuals join to form a diploid zygote. The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid cells called spores (<span class="s32">Figure 7.2</span><b>b</b>).<br/>The third life-cycle type, employed by some algae and all plants, is called alternation of generations. These species have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle. The haploid multicellular plants are called <b>gametophytes </b>because they produce gametes. Meiosis is not involved in the production of gametes in this case, as the organism that produces gametes is already haploid. Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote. The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a <b>sporophyte</b>. Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores. The spores will develop into the gametophytes (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">7.2<span style=" color: #000;">c</span><span class="p">).</span></p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="133" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_233.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">7.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Meiosis</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis<br/>•   Describe cellular events during meiosis<br/>•   Explain the differences between meiosis and mitosis<br/>•   Explain the mechanisms within meiosis that generate genetic variation among the products of meiosis<br/>Sexual reproduction requires <b>fertilization</b>, a union of two cells from two individual organisms. If those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes, then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes. The number of sets of chromosomes in a cell is called its ploidy level. Haploid cells contain one set of chromosomes. Cells containing two sets of chromosomes are called diploid. If the reproductive cycle is to continue, the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets before fertilization can occur again, or there will be a continual doubling in the number of chromosome sets in every generation. So, in addition to fertilization, sexual reproduction includes a nuclear division, known as meiosis, that reduces the number of chromosome sets.<br/>Most animals and plants are diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes; in each <b>somatic cell </b>(the nonreproductive cells of a multicellular organism), the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome that are referred to as homologous chromosomes. Somatic cells are sometimes referred to as “body” cells. Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing genes for the same traits in identical locations along their length. Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from each parent; all together, they are considered a full set of chromosomes. In animals, haploid cells containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome are found only within gametes. Gametes fuse with another haploid gamete to produce a diploid cell.<br/>The nuclear division that forms haploid cells, which is called meiosis, is related to mitosis. As you have learned, mitosis is part of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also genetically identical to the original parent nucleus. In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei contain the same number of chromosome sets—diploid for most plants and animals. Meiosis employs many of the same mechanisms as mitosis. However, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the nuclei that result at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid. To achieve the reduction in chromosome number, meiosis consists of one round of chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division. Because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned. However, because there are two rounds of division, the stages are designated with a “I” or “II.” Thus, <b>meiosis I </b>is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on. Meiosis I reduces the number of chromosome sets from two to one. The genetic information is also mixed during this division to create unique recombinant chromosomes. <b>Meiosis II</b>, in which the second round of meiotic division takes place in a way that is similar to mitosis, includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.</p><p class="s20">158                                                                                                                                                                                      Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance</p><p class="s24">Interphase</p><p>Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the G<span class="s54">1</span>, S, and G<span class="s54">2  </span>phases, which are nearly identical to the phases preceding mitosis. The G<span class="s54">1 </span>phase is the first phase of interphase and is focused on cell growth. In the S phase, the DNA of the chromosomes is replicated. Finally, in the G<span class="s54">2 </span>phase, the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis.<br/>During DNA duplication of the S phase, each chromosome becomes composed of two identical copies (called sister chromatids) that are held together at the centromere until they are pulled apart during meiosis II. In an animal cell, the centrosomes that organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle also replicate. This prepares the cell for the first meiotic phase.</p><p class="s24">Meiosis I</p><p>Early in prophase I, the chromosomes can be seen clearly microscopically. As the nuclear envelope begins to break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair close to each other. The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called <b>synapsis</b>. In synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are precisely aligned with each other. An exchange of chromosome segments between non-sister homologous chromatids occurs and is called <b>crossing over</b>. This process is revealed visually after the exchange as <b>chiasmata </b>(singular = <i>chiasma</i>) (<span class="s32">Figure 7.3</span>).<br/>As prophase I progresses, the close association between homologous chromosomes begins to break down, and the chromosomes continue to condense, although the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at chiasmata. The number of chiasmata varies with the species and the length of the chromosome. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together only at chiasmata (<span class="s32">Figure 7.3</span>) and are called <b>tetrads </b>because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible.<br/>The crossover events are the first source of genetic variation produced by meiosis. A single crossover event between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome. Now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete, it will carry some DNA from one parent of the individual and some DNA from the other parent. The <b>recombinant </b>sister chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance                                                                                                                                                                   159</p><p><span><IMG width="300" height="420" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_234.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  7.3 <span class="s30">In this illustration  of the  effects  of crossing over,  the  blue  chromosome came from the  individual’s father and  the  red  chromosome came from the  individual’s  mother.  Crossover occurs between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. The  result  is an  exchange of genetic material  between homologous chromosomes. The chromosomes that have  a mixture of maternal and  paternal sequence are  called  recombinant and  the chromosomes that are completely paternal or maternal are called non-recombinant.</span></p><p>The key event in prometaphase I is the attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at the centromeres. The microtubules assembled from centrosomes at opposite poles of the cell grow toward the middle of the cell. At the end of prometaphase I, each tetrad is attached to microtubules from both poles, with one homologous chromosome attached at one pole and the other homologous chromosome attached to the other pole. The homologous chromosomes are still held together at chiasmata. In addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely.<br/>During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the center of the cell with the kinetochores facing opposite poles. The orientation of each pair of homologous chromosomes at the center of the cell is random.<br/>This randomness, called independent assortment, is the physical basis for the generation of the second form of genetic variation in offspring. Consider that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one from each parent. Using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother. The father provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg. In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. Any maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole. Any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole. The orientation of each tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads.<br/>In each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the tetrads is different. The number of variations depends on the number of chromosomes making up a set. There are two possibilities for orientation (for each tetrad); thus, the possible number of alignments equals 2<span class="s56">n </span>where <i>n </i>is the number of chromosomes per set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (2<span class="s54">23</span>) possibilities. This number does not include the variability previously created in the sister chromatids by crossover. Given these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic composition (<span class="s32">Figure 7.4</span>).</p><p class="s20">160                                                                                                                                                                                      Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance</p><p>To summarize the genetic consequences of meiosis I: the maternal and paternal genes are recombined by crossover events occurring on each homologous pair during prophase I; in addition, the random assortment of tetrads at metaphase produces a unique combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="397" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_235.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  7.4 </span>To demonstrate random, independent assortment at metaphase I, consider a cell with <i>n </i>= 2. In this case, there  are  two possible arrangements at the equatorial plane  in metaphase I, as shown  in the upper  cell of each panel. These two possible orientations lead  to the production of genetically different gametes. With more  chromosomes, the number of possible arrangements increases dramatically.</p><p>In anaphase I, the spindle fibers pull the linked chromosomes apart. The sister chromatids remain tightly bound together at the centromere. It is the chiasma connections that are broken in anaphase I as the fibers attached to the fused kinetochores pull the homologous chromosomes apart (<span class="s32">Figure 7.5</span>).<br/>In telophase I, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. The remainder of the typical telophase events may or may not occur depending on the species. In some organisms, the chromosomes decondense and nuclear envelopes form around the chromatids in telophase I.<br/>Cytokinesis, the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells, occurs without reformation of the nuclei in other organisms. In nearly all species, cytokinesis separates the cell contents by either a cleavage furrow (in animals and some fungi), or a cell plate that will ultimately lead to formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells (in plants). At each pole, there is just one member of each pair of the homologous chromosomes, so only one full set of the chromosomes is present. This is why the cells are considered haploid—there is only one chromosome set, even though there are duplicate copies of the set because each homolog still consists of two sister chromatids that are still attached to each other. However, although the sister chromatids were once duplicates of the same chromosome, they are no longer identical at this stage because of crossovers.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance                                                                                                                                                                   161</p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_236.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_237.jpg"/></span><br/><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/animal_meiosis2" class="s25">Review the process of meiosis, observing how chromosomes align and migrate, at </a><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/animal_meiosis2" class="s36">this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/</a></p><p class="s32">l/animal_meiosis2) <span class="p">.</span></p><p class="s24">Meiosis II</p><p>In meiosis II, the connected sister chromatids remaining in the haploid cells from meiosis I will be split to form four haploid cells. In some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or <b>interkinesis</b>, that lacks an S phase, before entering meiosis II. Chromosomes are not duplicated during interkinesis. The two cells produced in meiosis I go through the events of meiosis II in synchrony. Overall, meiosis II resembles the mitotic division of a haploid cell.<br/>In prophase II, if the chromosomes decondensed in telophase I, they condense again. If nuclear envelopes were formed, they fragment into vesicles. The centrosomes duplicated during interkinesis move away from each other toward opposite poles, and new spindles are formed. In prometaphase II, the nuclear envelopes are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully formed. Each sister chromatid forms an individual kinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles. In metaphase II, the sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the center of the cell. In anaphase II, the sister chromatids are pulled apart by the spindle fibers and move toward opposite poles.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="361" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_238.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure   7.5  <span class="s30">In  prometaphase I, microtubules attach  to  the  fused   kinetochores of  homologous chromosomes.

Cytokinesis separates the two cells into four genetically unique haploid cells. At this point, the nuclei in the newly produced cells are both haploid and have only one copy of the single set of chromosomes. The cells produced are genetically unique because of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and because of the recombination of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomes—with their sets of genes—that occurs during crossover.</p><p class="s20">162                                                                                                                                                                                      Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance</p><p class="s24">Comparing Meiosis and Mitosis</p><p>Mitosis and meiosis, which are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells, share some similarities, but also exhibit distinct differences that lead to their very different outcomes. Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two nuclei, usually partitioned into two new cells. The nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the original. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes: one in the case of haploid cells, and two in the case of diploid cells. On the other hand, meiosis is two nuclear divisions that result in four nuclei, usually partitioned into four new cells. The nuclei resulting from meiosis are never genetically identical, and they contain one chromosome set only—this is half the number of the original cell, which was diploid (<span class="s32">Figure 7.6</span>).<br/>The differences in the outcomes of meiosis and mitosis occur because of differences in the behavior of the chromosomes during each process. Most of these differences in the processes occur in meiosis I, which is a very different nuclear division than mitosis. In meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs become associated with each other, are bound together, experience chiasmata and crossover between sister chromatids, and line up along the metaphase plate in tetrads with spindle fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog in a tetrad. All of these events occur only in meiosis I, never in mitosis.<br/>Homologous chromosomes move to opposite poles during meiosis I so the number of sets of chromosomes in each nucleus- to-be is reduced from two to one. For this reason, meiosis I is referred to as a <b>reduction division</b>. There is no such reduction in ploidy level in mitosis.<br/>Meiosis II is much more analogous to a mitotic division. In this case, duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line up at the center of the cell with divided kinetochores attached to spindle fibers from opposite poles. During anaphase II, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatid is pulled to one pole and the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. If it were not for the fact that there had been crossovers, the two products of each meiosis II division would be identical as in mitosis; instead, they are different because there has always been at least one crossover per chromosome. Meiosis II is not a reduction division because, although there are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis I.<br/>Cells produced by mitosis will function in different parts of the body as a part of growth or replacing dead or damaged cells. They may even be involved in asexual reproduction in some organisms. Cells produced by meiosis in a diploid-dominant organism such as an animal will only participate in sexual reproduction.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance                                                                                                                                                                   163</p><p><span><IMG width="451" height="416" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_239.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_240.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  7.6 <span class="s30">Meiosis  and  mitosis  are  both  preceded by one  round  of DNA replication;  however, meiosis includes two nuclear divisions.

A  <b>karyotype  </b>is  the  number  and  appearance  of chromosomes, including their length, banding pattern, and centromere position. To obtain a view of an individual’s karyotype, cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart, or <b>karyogram </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 7.7</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="122" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_243.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  7.7 <span class="s30">This karyogram shows the chromosomes of a female  human immune  cell during mitosis.

To observe an  individual’s  karyotype, a  person’s cells  (like white  blood  cells)  are  first collected from a blood  sample or other  tissue. In the  laboratory, the  isolated cells  are  stimulated to begin actively  dividing. A chemical is then  applied  to the  cells  to arrest mitosis  during  metaphase. The cells  are then fixed to a slide.<br/>The  geneticist then  stains chromosomes with  one  of  several dyes   to  better   visualize   the  distinct  and reproducible banding patterns  of each chromosome pair.  Following  staining, chromosomes  are  viewed using  bright-field  microscopy. An experienced  cytogeneticist can  identify  each band. In addition  to  the banding patterns, chromosomes are further identified on the basis of size and centromere location. To obtain the classic depiction  of the karyotype in which homologous pairs  of chromosomes are  aligned  in numerical order  from longest to shortest, the  geneticist obtains a  digital image,  identifies  each chromosome, and manually  arranges the chromosomes into this pattern (<span class="s32">Figure 7.7</span>).<br/>At its most  basic,  the karyogram may reveal  genetic abnormalities in which an individual has  too many  or too few chromosomes per cell. Examples of this are  Down syndrome, which is identified by a third copy of chromosome 21, and Turner syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of only one X chromosome in women  instead of two. Geneticists can  also  identify large  deletions or insertions of DNA. For instance, Jacobsen  syndrome, which  involves  distinctive  facial  features as well as heart  and  bleeding defects, is identified by a deletion  on chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint <b>translocations</b>, which occur when  a segment of genetic material  breaks from one  chromosome and  reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome. Translocations are  implicated  in certain  cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia.<br/>By observing a karyogram, geneticists can  actually  visualize  the chromosomal composition of an individual to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities in offspring even  before  birth.</p><p class="s34">Nondisjunctions, Duplications, and Deletions</p><p>Of all the chromosomal disorders, abnormalities in chromosome number are the most easily identifiable from a karyogram. Disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes, as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes. They are caused by <b>nondisjunction</b>, which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis. The risk of nondisjunction increases with the age of the parents.<br/>Nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis I or II, with different results (<span class="s32">Figure 7.8</span>). If homologous chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis I, the result is two gametes that lack that chromosome and two gametes with two copies of the<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance                                                                                                                                                                   165</p><p>chromosome.

An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as <b>aneuploid</b>, a term that includes <b>monosomy </b>(loss of one chromosome) or <b>trisomy </b>(gain of an extraneous chromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they have only one copy of essential genes. Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop to birth; however, duplications of some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several weeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose. Cell functions are calibrated to the amount of gene product produced by two copies (doses) of each gene; adding a third copy (dose) disrupts this balance. The most common trisomy is that of chromosome 21, which leads to Down syndrome. Individuals with this inherited disorder have characteristic physical features and developmental delays in growth and cognition. The incidence of Down syndrome is correlated with maternal age, such that older women are more likely to give birth to children with Down syndrome (<span class="s32">Figure 7.9</span>).</p><p class="s20">166                                                                                                                                                                                      Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance</p><p><span><IMG width="349" height="314" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_246.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_247.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 7.9 <span class="s30">The incidence of having a fetus with trisomy 21 increases dramatically  with maternal age.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_248.png"/></span><br/><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/down_syndrome2" class="s25">Visualize    the    addition    of    a    chromosome    that    leads    to    Down    syndrome    in    this    </a><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/down_syndrome2" class="s36">video    simulation</a></p><p class="s32">(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/down_syndrome2) <span class="p">.</span></p><p>Humans  display  dramatic  deleterious  effects  with  autosomal  trisomies  and  monosomies.  Therefore,  it  may  seem counterintuitive that  human  females  and  males  can  function  normally,  despite  carrying  different  numbers  of  the  X chromosome.  In  part,  this  occurs  because  of  a  process  called  <b>X  inactivation</b>.  Early  in  development,  when  female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells, one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by condensing into a structure called a Barr body. The genes on the inactive X chromosome are not expressed. The particular X chromosome (maternally or paternally derived) that is inactivated in each cell is random, but once the inactivation occurs, all cells descended from that cell will have the same inactive X chromosome. By this process, females compensate for their double genetic dose of X chromosome.<br/>In so-called “tortoiseshell” cats, X inactivation is observed as coat-color variegation (<span class="s32">Figure 7.10</span>). Females heterozygous for an X-linked coat color gene will express one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body, corresponding to whichever X chromosome is inactivated in the embryonic cell progenitor of that region. When you see a tortoiseshell cat, you will know that it has to be a female.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance                                                                                                                                                                   167</p><p><span><IMG width="250" height="278" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_249.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  7.10 <span class="s30">Embryonic  inactivation  of one of two different X chromosomes encoding different coat colors  gives rise to the tortoiseshell phenotype in cats.

As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with mild mental and physical defects, as well as sterility. If the X chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop.<br/>Several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized. Individuals with three X chromosomes, called triplo-X, appear female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY chromosome complement, corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and reduced body hair. The extra X chromosome undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic dosage. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 chromosome complement (i.e., only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.<br/>An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called <b>polyploid</b>. For instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Triploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally with an odd number of chromosome sets. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species.</p><p class="s24">Chromosome Structural  Rearrangements</p><p>Cytologists  have  characterized  numerous  structural  rearrangements  in  chromosomes,  including  partial  duplications, deletions, inversions, and translocations.

In rare  instances, such  a  change can  result  in the  evolution  of a  new  species. In fact,  an  inversion  in chromosome 18 appears to have  contributed to the evolution of humans. This inversion  is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees.<br/>The chromosome 18 inversion  is believed to have  occurred in early humans following their divergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago.  Researchers have  suggested that a long stretch of DNA was duplicated on chromosome 18 of an ancestor to humans, but that during the duplication  it was inverted  (inserted into the chromosome in reverse orientation.<br/>A  comparison  of  human  and   chimpanzee genes  in  the   region   of  this  inversion   indicates  that   two genes—<i>ROCK1  </i>and   <i>USP14</i>—are  farther   apart   on   human  chromosome  18   than   they   are   on   the corresponding chimpanzee chromosome. This  suggests that  one  of the  inversion  breakpoints occurred between these two genes.  Interestingly, humans and  chimpanzees express <i>USP14 </i>at  distinct  levels  in specific  cell  types, including  cortical  cells  and  fibroblasts. Perhaps  the  chromosome 18  inversion  in an ancestral human repositioned specific  genes and  reset their  expression levels  in a  useful  way.  Because both <i>ROCK1  </i>and  <i>USP14 </i>code  for enzymes, a change in their expression could alter cellular function.  It is not known how this inversion  contributed to hominid evolution,  but it appears to be a significant factor in the</p><p class="s55">[2]</p><p>divergence of humans from other  primates.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="367" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_251.png"/></span><br/>A translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome. Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects, depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences. Notably, specific translocations have been associated with several cancers and with schizophrenia. Reciprocal translocations result from the exchange of chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no gain or loss of genetic information (<span class="s32">Figure 7.12</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="202" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_252.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  7.12  <span class="s30">An  (a)  inversion   occurs when  a  chromosome segment  breaks  from  the  chromosome, reverses  its orientation,  and   then   reattaches  in  the   original   position.

The variation introduced into the reproductive cells by meiosis appears to be one of the advantages of sexual reproduction that has made it so successful. Meiosis and fertilization alternate in sexual life cycles. The process of meiosis produces genetically unique reproductive cells called gametes, which have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Fertilization, the fusion of haploid gametes from two individuals, restores the diploid condition. Thus, sexually reproducing organisms alternate between haploid and diploid stages. However, the ways in which reproductive cells are produced and the timing between meiosis and fertilization vary greatly. There are three main categories of life cycles: diploid-dominant, demonstrated by most animals; haploid-dominant, demonstrated by all fungi and some algae; and alternation of generations, demonstrated by plants and some algae.</p><p class="s52">7.2 Meiosis</p><p>Sexual reproduction requires that diploid organisms produce haploid cells that can fuse during fertilization to form diploid offspring. The process that results in haploid cells is called meiosis. Meiosis is a series of events that arrange and separate chromosomes into daughter cells. During the interphase of meiosis, each chromosome is duplicated. In meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei and usually four haploid daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. During meiosis, variation in the daughter nuclei is introduced because of crossover in prophase I and random alignment at metaphase I. The cells that are produced by meiosis are genetically unique.<br/>Meiosis and mitosis share similarities, but have distinct outcomes. Mitotic divisions are single nuclear divisions that produce daughter nuclei that are genetically identical and have the same number of chromosome sets as the original cell. Meiotic divisions are two nuclear divisions that produce four daughter nuclei that are genetically different and have one chromosome set rather than the two sets the parent cell had. The main differences between the processes occur in the first division of meiosis. The homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei during meiosis I causing a reduction of ploidy level. The second division of meiosis is much more similar to a mitotic division.</p><p class="s52">7.3 Errors in Meiosis</p><p>The number, size, shape, and banding pattern of chromosomes make them easily identifiable in a karyogram and allow for the assessment of many chromosomal abnormalities. Disorders in chromosome number, or aneuploidies, are typically lethal to the embryo, although a few trisomic genotypes are viable. Because of X inactivation, aberrations in sex chromosomes typically have milder effects on an individual. Aneuploidies also include instances in which segments of a chromosome are duplicated or deleted. Chromosome structures also may be rearranged, for example by inversion or translocation. Both of these aberrations can result in negative effects on development, or death. Because they force chromosomes to assume contorted pairings during meiosis I, inversions and translocations are often associated with reduced fertility because of the likelihood of nondisjunction.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 7.2 </span><span class="p">If a mutation occurs so that a fungus is no longer able to produce a minus mating type, will it still be able to reproduce?</span></p><p class="s24">REVIEW QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">2. <span class="p">What is a likely evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction?</span></p><p>a.   sexual reproduction involves fewer steps</p><p class="s20">172                                                                                                                                                                                      Chapter 7 | The Cellular Basis  of Inheritance</p><p>b.   less chance of using up the resources in a given environment<br/>c.   sexual reproduction results in greater variation in the offspring<br/>d.   sexual reproduction is more cost-effective</p><p class="s27">3. <span class="p">Which type of life cycle has both a haploid and diploid multicellular stage?</span></p><p>a.   an asexual life cycle<br/>b.   diploid-dominant<br/>c.   haploid-dominant<br/>d.   alternation of generations</p><p class="s27">4. <span class="p">Which event leads to a diploid cell in a life cycle?</span></p><p>a.   meiosis<br/>b.   fertilization<br/>c.   alternation of generations<br/>d.   mutation<br/><b>5. </b>Meiosis produces <u>              </u> daughter cells.<br/>a.   two haploid b.   two diploid c.   four haploid d.   four diploid</p><p class="s27">6. <span class="p">At which stage of meiosis are sister chromatids separated from each other?</span></p><p>a.   prophase I b.   prophase II c.   anaphase I d.   anaphase II</p><p class="s27">7. <span class="p">The part of meiosis that is similar to mitosis is</span></p><p class="s53">              <span class="p">.</span></p><p>a.   meiosis I b.   anaphase I c.   meiosis II<br/>d.   interkinesis</p><p class="s27">8. <span class="p">If a muscle cell of a typical organism has 32 chromosomes, how many chromosomes will be in a gamete of that same organism?</span></p><p>a.   8 b.   16 c.   32 d.   64</p><p class="s27">9. <span class="p">The genotype XXY corresponds to:</span></p><p>a.

Johann Gregor Mendel set the framework for genetics long before chromosomes or genes had been identified, at a time when meiosis was not well understood. Mendel selected a simple biological system and conducted methodical, quantitative analyses using large sample sizes. Because of Mendel’s work, the fundamental principles of heredity were revealed. We now know that genes, carried on chromosomes, are the basic functional units of heredity with the ability to be replicated, expressed, or mutated. Today, the postulates put forth by Mendel form the basis of classical, or Mendelian, genetics. Not all genes are transmitted from parents to offspring according to Mendelian genetics, but Mendel’s experiments serve as an excellent starting point for thinking about inheritance.</p><p class="s20">174                                                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 8 | Patterns of Inheritance</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="91" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_256.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">8.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Mendel’s Experiments</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Explain the scientific reasons for the success of Mendel’s experimental work<br/>•   Describe the expected outcomes of monohybrid crosses involving dominant and recessive alleles<br/><span><IMG width="225" height="269" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_257.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 8.2 <span class="s30">Johann Gregor  Mendel set the framework  for the study of genetics.</span></p><p>Johann Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) (<span class="s32">Figure 8.2</span>) was a lifelong learner, teacher, scientist, and man of faith. As a young adult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic. Supported by the monastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels. In 1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary <b>model system </b>(a system with convenient characteristics that is used to study a specific biological phenomenon to gain understanding to be applied to other systems). In 1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly<br/>30,000 pea plants to the local natural history society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to</p><p class="s55">[1]</p><p>offspring in specific patterns. In 1866, he published his work, <i>Experiments in Plant Hybridization,</i><br/>the Natural History Society of Brünn.<br/>in the proceedings of<br/>Mendel’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community, which incorrectly believed that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring. This hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation. <b>Continuous variation </b>is the range of small differences we see among individuals in a characteristic like human height. It does appear that offspring are a “blend” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation. Mendel worked instead with traits that show <b>discontinuous variation</b>. Discontinuous variation is the variation seen among individuals when each individual shows one of two—or a very few—easily distinguishable traits, such as violet or white flowers. Mendel’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring as would have been expected at the time, but that they were inherited as distinct traits. In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific contributions during his lifetime; in fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.</p><p class="s24">Mendel’s Crosses</p><p>Mendel’s seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea, <i>Pisum sativum</i>, to study inheritance. This species naturally self-fertilizes, meaning that pollen encounters ova within the same flower. The flower petals remain sealed tightly until pollination is completed to prevent the pollination of other plants. The result is highly inbred, or “true-breeding,” pea plants.<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_258.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">1.

By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. The garden pea also grows to maturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time. Finally, large quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his results did not come about simply by chance.<br/>Mendel performed <b>hybridizations</b>, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits. In the pea, which is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety.<br/>Plants used in first-generation crosses were called <b>P</b>, or parental generation, plants (<span class="s32">Figure 8.3</span>). Mendel collected the seeds produced by the P plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season. These offspring were called the <b>F</b><span class="s63">1</span>, or the first filial (filial = daughter or son), generation. Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F<span class="s54">1 </span>generation of plants, he allowed them to self-fertilize naturally. He then collected and grew the seeds from the F<span class="s54">1 </span>plants to produce the <b>F</b><span class="s63">2</span>, or second filial, generation. Mendel’s experiments extended beyond the F<span class="s54">2 </span>generation to the F<span class="s54">3 </span>generation, F<span class="s54">4 </span>generation, and so on, but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P, F<span class="s54">1</span>, and F<span class="s54">2 </span>generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis of Mendel’s postulates.</p><p class="s20">176                                                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 8 | Patterns of Inheritance</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="634" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_259.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 8.3 <span class="s30">Mendel’s process for performing  crosses included  examining flower color.</span></p><p class="s24">Garden Pea Characteristics Revealed the Basics of Heredity</p><p>In his 1865 publication, Mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics, each with two contrasting traits. A <b>trait </b>is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic. The characteristics included plant height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, pea-pod size, pea-pod color, and flower position. For the characteristic of flower color, for example, the two contrasting traits were white versus violet. To fully examine each characteristic, Mendel generated large numbers of F<span class="s54">1 </span>and F<span class="s54">2 </span>plants and reported results from thousands of F<span class="s54">2 </span>plants.<br/>What results did Mendel find in his crosses for flower color? First, Mendel confirmed that he was using plants that bred true for white or violet flower color. Irrespective of the number of generations that Mendel examined, all self-crossed offspring of parents with white flowers had white flowers, and all self-crossed offspring of parents with violet flowers had violet flowers. In addition, Mendel confirmed that, other than flower color, the pea plants were physically identical. This was an important check to make sure that the two varieties of pea plants only differed with respect to one trait, flower color.<br/>Once these validations were complete, Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers. After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross, Mendel found that 100 percent of<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 8 | Patterns of Inheritance                                                                                                                                                                                   177</p><p>the F<span class="s54">1 </span>hybrid generation had violet flowers. Conventional wisdom at that time would have predicted the hybrid flowers to be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers. In other words, the contrasting parental traits were expected to blend in the offspring. Instead, Mendel’s results demonstrated that the white flower trait had completely disappeared in the F<span class="s54">1 </span>generation.<br/>Importantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there. He allowed the F<span class="s54">1 </span>plants to self-fertilize and found that 705 plants in the F<span class="s54">2 </span>generation had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers. This was a ratio of 3.15 violet flowers to one white flower, or approximately 3:1. When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa, he obtained approximately the same ratio irrespective of which parent—male or female—contributed which trait. This is called a <b>reciprocal cross</b>—a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross. For the other six characteristics that Mendel examined, the F<span class="s54">1 </span>and F<span class="s54">2 </span>generations behaved in the same way that they behaved for flower color. One of the two traits would disappear completely from the F<span class="s54">1 </span>generation, only to reappear in the F<span class="s54">2 </span>generation at a ratio of roughly 3:1 (<span class="s32">Figure 8.4</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="372" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_260.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 8.4 <span class="s30">Mendel identified seven pea  plant characteristics.</span></p><p>Upon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, Mendel concluded that the characteristics could be divided into expressed and latent traits. He called these dominant and recessive traits, respectively. <b>Dominant </b>traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization. <b>Recessive </b>traits become latent, or disappear in the offspring of a hybridization. The recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring. An example of a dominant trait is the violet- colored flower trait. For this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. The fact that the recessive trait reappeared in the F<span class="s54">2 </span>generation meant that the traits remained separate (and were not blended) in the plants of the F<span class="s54">1 </span>generation. Mendel proposed that this was because the plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower- color characteristic, and that each parent transmitted one of their two copies to their offspring, where they came together. Moreover, the physical observation of a dominant trait could mean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of the characteristic, or that it included one dominant and one recessive version. Conversely, the observation of a recessive trait meant that the organism lacked any dominant versions of this characteristic.</p><p class="s20">178                                                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 8 | Patterns of Inheritance</p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_261.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_262.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/mendels_peas" class="s25">For an excellent review of Mendel’s experiments and to perform your own crosses and identify patterns of inheritance, visit the </a>Mendel’s Peas (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/mendels_peas) <span class="p">web lab.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="134" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_263.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">8.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Laws of Inheritance</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Explain the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes in dominant and recessive gene systems<br/>•   Use a Punnett square to calculate the expected proportions of genotypes and phenotypes in a monohybrid cross<br/>•   Explain Mendel’s law of segregation and independent assortment in terms of genetics and the events of meiosis<br/>•   Explain the purpose and methods of a test cross<br/>The seven characteristics that Mendel evaluated in his pea plants were each expressed as one of two versions, or traits. Mendel deduced from his results that each individual had two discrete copies of the characteristic that are passed individually to offspring. We now call those two copies genes, which are carried on chromosomes. The reason we have two copies of each gene is that we inherit one from each parent. In fact, it is the chromosomes we inherit and the two copies of each gene are located on paired chromosomes. Recall that in meiosis these chromosomes are separated out into haploid gametes. This separation, or segregation, of the homologous chromosomes means also that only one of the copies of the gene gets moved into a gamete. The offspring are formed when that gamete unites with one from another parent and the two copies of each gene (and chromosome) are restored.<br/>For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic. For example, one individual may carry a gene that determines white flower color and a gene that determines violet flower color. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called <b>alleles</b>. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.</p><p class="s24">Phenotypes and Genotypes</p><p>Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its <b>phenotype</b>. An organism’s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both the physically visible and the non-expressed alleles, is called its <b>genotype</b>. Mendel’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. For example, the phenotypes that Mendel observed in his crosses between pea plants with differing traits are connected to the diploid genotypes of the plants in the P, F<span class="s54">1</span>, and F<span class="s54">2 </span>generations. We will use a second trait that Mendel investigated, seed color, as an example. Seed color is governed by a single gene with two alleles. The yellow-seed allele is dominant and the green-seed allele is recessive. When true-breeding plants were cross-fertilized, in which one parent had yellow seeds and one had green seeds, all of the F<span class="s54">1 </span>hybrid offspring had yellow seeds. That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow seeds. However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green seeds was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F<span class="s54">2 </span>offspring (<span class="s32">Figure 8.5</span>). Therefore, the F<span class="s54">1 </span>plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow seeds.<br/>The P plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that are <b>homozygous </b>for a gene have two identical alleles, one on each of their homologous chromosomes. The genotype is often written as <i>YY </i>or <i>yy</i>, for which each letter represents one of the two alleles in the genotype. The dominant allele is capitalized and the recessive allele is lower case. The letter used for the gene (seed color in this case) is usually related to the dominant trait (yellow allele, in this case, or “<i>Y</i>”). Mendel’s parental pea plants always bred true because both<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 8 | Patterns of Inheritance                                                                                                                                                                                   179</p><p>produced gametes carried the same allele.

Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was referred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous chromosomes. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype), and the recessive allele will only be observed in homozygous recessive individuals (<span class="s32">Table 8.1</span>).</p><p class="s60">Correspondence between Genotype and Phenotype for a Dominant-Recessive</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="51" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_265.png"/></span></p><p class="s60">Characteristic.</p><p class="s52">Homozygous                       Heterozygous                       Homozygous</p><p>Genotype              <i>YY                                                 Yy                                                    yy</i></p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s19">Phenotype</p></td><td><p class="s19">yellow</p></td><td><p class="s19">yellow</p></td><td><p class="s19">green</p></td></tr></table><p class="s17">Table 8.1</p><p>Mendel’s <b>law of dominance </b>states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic. For example, when crossing true-breeding violet-flowered plants with true-breeding white-flowered plants, all of the offspring were violet-flowered, even though they all had one allele for violet and one allele for white. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. The recessive allele will remain latent, but will be transmitted to offspring in the same manner as that by which the dominant allele is transmitted.

Mendel performed seven types of monohybrid crosses, each involving contrasting traits for different characteristics. Out of these crosses, all of the F<span class="s54">1 </span>offspring had the phenotype of one parent, and the F<span class="s54">2 </span>offspring had a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. On the basis of these results, Mendel postulated that each parent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination of unit factors was equally likely.<br/>The results of Mendel’s research can be explained in terms of probabilities, which are mathematical measures of likelihood. The probability of an event is calculated by the number of times the event occurs divided by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur. A probability of one (100 percent) for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero (0 percent) indicates that it is guaranteed to not occur, and a probability of 0.5 (50 percent) means it has an equal chance of occurring or not occurring.<br/>To demonstrate this with a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green seeds. The dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were <i>YY </i>for the plants with yellow seeds and <i>yy </i>for the plants with green seeds. A <b>Punnett square</b>, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, is useful for determining probabilities because it is drawn to predict all possible outcomes of all possible random fertilization events and their expected frequencies. <span class="s32">Figure 8.9 </span>shows a Punnett square for a cross between a plant with yellow peas and one with green peas. To prepare a Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles (the genotypes of the gametes) are listed along the top (for one parent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid. The combinations of egg and sperm gametes are then made in the boxes in the table on the basis of which alleles are combining. Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or fertilized egg. Because each possibility is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a Punnett square. If the pattern of inheritance (dominant and recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be inferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents, each parent contributes one type of allele. In this case, only one genotype is possible in the F<span class="s54">1 </span>offspring. All offspring are <i>Yy </i>and have yellow seeds.<br/>When the F<span class="s54">1 </span>offspring are crossed with each other, each has an equal probability of contributing either a <i>Y </i>or a <i>y </i>to the F<span class="s54">2 </span>offspring. The result is a 1 in 4 (25 percent) probability of both parents contributing a <i>Y</i>, resulting in an offspring with a yellow phenotype; a 25 percent probability of parent A contributing a <i>Y </i>and parent B a <i>y</i>, resulting in offspring with a yellow phenotype; a 25 percent probability of parent A contributing a <i>y </i>and parent B a <i>Y</i>, also resulting in a yellow phenotype; and a (25 percent) probability of both parents contributing a <i>y</i>, resulting in a green phenotype. When counting all four possible outcomes, there is a 3 in 4 probability of offspring having the yellow phenotype and a 1 in 4 probability of offspring having the green phenotype. This explains why the results of Mendel’s F<span class="s54">2 </span>generation occurred in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio.

This law states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor. For the F<span class="s54">2 </span>generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three possible combinations of genotypes result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. Because heterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent), and because heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports Mendel’s observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio. The equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes. The physical basis of Mendel’s law of segregation is the first division of meiosis in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei. This process was not understood by the scientific community during Mendel’s lifetime (<span class="s32">Figure 8.7</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="214" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_267.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 8.7 <span class="s30">The first division in meiosis is shown.</span></p><p class="s34">Test Cross</p><p>Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents, Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote.

In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic. If the dominant-expressing organism is a homozygote, then all F<span class="s54">1 </span>offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait (<span class="s32">Figure 8.8</span>).

For example, a gamete could get an <i>R </i>allele for the seed shape gene and either a <i>Y </i>or a <i>y </i>allele for the seed color gene. It cannot get both an <i>R </i>and an <i>r </i>allele; each gamete can have only one allele per gene. The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an <i>r </i>allele is sorted would be equally likely to contain either a <i>Y </i>or a <i>y </i>allele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when the <i>RrYy </i>heterozygote is self-crossed, as follows: <i>RY</i>, <i>rY</i>, <i>Ry</i>, and <i>ry</i>. Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4 × 4 Punnett square (<span class="s32">Figure 8.10</span>) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. From these genotypes, we find a phenotypic ratio of 9 round–yellow:3 round–green:3 wrinkled–yellow:1 wrinkled–green (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">8.10<span class="p">).

The inheritance of the traits he studied all followed the relatively simple pattern of dominant and recessive alleles for a single characteristic. There are several important modes of inheritance, discovered after Mendel’s work, that do not follow the dominant and recessive, single-gene model.</p><p class="s24">Alternatives to Dominance and Recessiveness</p><p>Mendel’s experiments with pea plants suggested that: 1) two types of “units” or alleles exist for every gene; 2) alleles maintain their integrity in each generation (no blending); and 3) in the presence of the dominant allele, the recessive allele is hidden, with no contribution to the phenotype. Therefore, recessive alleles can be “carried” and not expressed by individuals. Such heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as “carriers.” Since then, genetic studies in other organisms have shown that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics still hold true. In the sections to follow, we consider some of the extensions of Mendelism.</p><p class="s20">186                                                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 8 | Patterns of Inheritance</p><p class="s34">Incomplete Dominance</p><p class="s22"><span class="p">Mendel’s results, demonstrating that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs, contradicted the view at that time that offspring exhibited a blend of their parents’ traits.

We now know that this is an oversimplification. Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) can only have two alleles for a given gene, multiple alleles may exist at the population level, such that many combinations of two alleles are observed. Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene, the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype in the natural population as the <b>wild type </b>(often abbreviated “+”). All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants (mutants) of this typical form, meaning they deviate from the wild type. The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild-type allele.<br/>An example of multiple alleles is the ABO blood-type system in humans. In this case, there are three alleles circulating in the population. The <i>I</i><span class="s56">A </span>allele codes for A molecules on the red blood cells, the <i>I</i><span class="s56">B </span>allele codes for B molecules on the surface of red blood cells, and the <i>i </i>allele codes for no molecules on the red blood cells.

When  promptly and  correctly  treated, <i>P. falciparum  </i>malaria  has  a mortality rate  of 0.1 percent. However,  in some parts  of the world, the parasite has  evolved  resistance to commonly used malaria  treatments, so the most effective malarial  treatments can vary by geographic region.<br/>In Southeast Asia, Africa, and  South  America,  <i>P. falciparum  </i>has  developed resistance to the anti-malarial drugs  chloroquine, mefloquine, and  sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. <i>P. falciparum</i>,  which is haploid  during  the life stage in which it is infective  to humans, has  evolved  multiple drug-resistant mutant  alleles  of the <i>dhps </i>gene. Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are associated with each of these alleles. Being haploid, <i>P. falciparum </i>needs only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.<br/>In  Southeast  Asia,  different  sulfadoxine-resistant  alleles   of  the   <i>dhps   </i>gene  are   localized   to  different geographic regions. This is a common evolutionary phenomenon  that comes about  because drug-resistant mutants arise  in a population  and interbreed with other <i>P. falciparum </i>isolates in close  proximity. Sulfadoxine- resistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions in which this drug  is widely used as an over-the-counter malaria  remedy. As is common with pathogens that  multiply to large  numbers within an infection  cycle,  <i>P. falciparum  </i>evolves relatively  rapidly (over  a decade or so)  in response to the  selective pressure of commonly  used anti-malarial drugs.

Until now, we have only considered inheritance patterns among non-sex chromosomes, or autosomes. In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes, whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair. Although the Y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis, the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains fewer genes. When a gene being examined is present on the X, but not the Y, chromosome, it is <b>X-linked</b>.<br/>Eye color in <i>Drosophila</i>, the common fruit fly, was the first X-linked trait to be identified. Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait to the X chromosome in 1910.

When a female parent is homozygous for a recessive X-linked trait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her male offspring, because the males will receive the Y chromosome from the male parent. In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some color-blindness, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked. Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and may not exhibit any phenotypic effects. These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half of their daughters; therefore, X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_280.jpg"/></span><br/>In some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the sex with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female rather than the male.

Genes that are located on separate, non- homologous chromosomes will always sort independently. However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes, organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by <b>linkage</b>, in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair. However, because of the process of recombination, or “crossover,” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently, or as if they are not linked. To understand this, let us consider the biological basis of gene linkage and recombination.<br/>Homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same order, though the specific alleles of the gene can be different on each of the two chromosomes. Recall that during interphase and prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes first replicate and then synapse, with like genes on the homologs aligning with each other. At this stage, segments of homologous chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material (<span class="s32">Figure 8.17</span>). This process is called <b>recombination</b>, or crossover, and it is a common genetic process. Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the gene order is not altered. Instead, the result of recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome. Across a given chromosome, several recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of alleles.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="250" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_282.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  8.17  <span class="s30">The  process of crossover, or  recombination, occurs when  two  homologous chromosomes  align  and exchange a segment of genetic material.</span></p><p>When two genes are located on the same chromosome, they are considered linked, and their alleles tend to be transmitted through meiosis together. To exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving flower color and plant height in which the genes are next to each other on the chromosome. If one homologous chromosome has alleles for tall plants and red flowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and yellow flowers, then when the gametes are formed, the tall and red alleles will tend to go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into other gametes. These are called the parental genotypes because they have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual producing gametes. But unlike if the genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no gametes with tall and yellow alleles and no gametes with short and red alleles. If you create a Punnett square with these gametes, you will see that the classical Mendelian prediction of a<br/>9:3:3:1 outcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply. As the distance between two genes increases, the probability of one or more crossovers between them increases and the genes behave more like they are on separate chromosomes. Geneticists have used the proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents) as a measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome. Using this information, they have constructed linkage maps of genes on chromosomes for well-studied organisms, including humans.<br/>Mendel’s seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many researchers have questioned whether he encountered linkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his independent assortment postulate. The garden pea has seven chromosomes, and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was not a coincidence. However, even if the genes he examined were not located on separate chromosomes, it is possible that he simply did not observe linkage because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination.</p><p class="s20">192                                                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 8 | Patterns of Inheritance</p><p class="s24">Epistasis</p><p><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_283.jpg"/></span><br/>Mendel’s studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individual’s phenotype was controlled by genes (or as he called them, unit factors), such that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a single gene. In fact, single observable characteristics are almost always under the influence of multiple genes (each with two or more alleles) acting in unison. For example, at least eight genes contribute to eye color in humans.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_284.png"/></span><br/><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/eye_color_calc" class="s25">Eye color in humans is determined by multiple alleles.

In the case of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially, with each gene adding to the complexity and specificity of the organ. Genes may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or more genes expressed simultaneously affect a phenotype. An apparent example of this occurs with human skin color, which appears to involve the action of at least three (and probably more) genes. Cases in which inheritance for a characteristic like skin color or human height depend on the combined effects of numerous genes are called polygenic inheritance.<br/>Genes may also oppose each other, with one gene suppressing the expression of another. In <b>epistasis</b>, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another. “Epistasis” is a word composed of Greek roots meaning “standing upon.” The alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking. Often the biochemical basis of epistasis is a gene pathway in which expression of one gene is dependent on the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in the pathway.<br/>An example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice. The wild-type coat color, agouti (AA) is dominant to solid-colored fur (aa). However, a separate gene C, when present as the recessive homozygote (cc), negates any expression of pigment from the A gene and results in an albino mouse (<span class="s32">Figure 8.18</span>). Therefore, the genotypes <i>AAcc</i>, <i>Aacc</i>, and <i>aacc </i>all produce the same albino phenotype. A cross between heterozygotes for both genes (<i>AaCc </i>x <i>AaCc</i>) would generate offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 9 agouti:3 black:4 albino (<span class="s32">Figure 8.18</span>).

The traits that were visible in the F<span class="s54">1 </span>generation are referred to as dominant, and traits that disappear in the F<span class="s54">1 </span>generation are described as recessive. When the F<span class="s54">1 </span>plants in Mendel’s experiment were self-crossed, the F<span class="s54">2 </span>offspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 3:1 ratio, confirming that the recessive trait had been transmitted faithfully from the original P parent. Reciprocal crosses generated identical F<span class="s54">1 </span>and F<span class="s54">2 </span>offspring ratios. By examining sample sizes, Mendel showed that traits were inherited as independent events.</p><p class="s52">8.2 Laws of Inheritance</p><p>When true-breeding, or homozygous, individuals that differ for a certain trait are crossed, all of the offspring will be heterozygous for that trait. If the traits are inherited as dominant and recessive, the F<span class="s54">1 </span>offspring will all exhibit the same phenotype as the parent homozygous for the dominant trait. If these heterozygous offspring are self-crossed, the resulting F<span class="s54">2 </span>offspring will be equally likely to inherit gametes carrying the dominant or recessive trait, giving rise to offspring of which one quarter are homozygous dominant, half are heterozygous, and one quarter are homozygous recessive. Because homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals are phenotypically identical, the observed traits in the F<span class="s54">2 </span>offspring will exhibit a ratio of three dominant to one recessive.<br/>Mendel postulated that genes (characteristics) are inherited as pairs of alleles (traits) that behave in a dominant and recessive pattern. Alleles segregate into gametes such that each gamete is equally likely to receive either one of the two alleles present in a diploid individual. In addition, genes are assorted into gametes independently of one another. That is, in general, alleles are not more likely to segregate into a gamete with a particular allele of another gene.</p><p class="s52">8.3 Extensions of the Laws of Inheritance</p><p>Alleles do not always behave in dominant and recessive patterns. Incomplete dominance describes situations in which the heterozygote exhibits a phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous phenotypes. Codominance describes the simultaneous expression of both of the alleles in the heterozygote. Although diploid organisms can only have two alleles for any given gene, it is common for more than two alleles for a gene to exist in a population. In humans, as in many animals and some plants, females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Genes that are present on the X but not the Y chromosome are said to be X-linked, such that males only inherit one allele for the gene,<br/>and females inherit two.<br/>According to Mendel’s law of independent assortment, genes sort independently of each other into gametes during meiosis. This occurs because chromosomes, on which the genes reside, assort independently during meiosis and crossovers cause most genes on the same chromosomes to also behave independently. When genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, their alleles tend to be inherited together. This results in offspring ratios that violate Mendel&#39;s law of independent assortment. However, recombination serves to exchange genetic material on homologous chromosomes such that maternal and paternal alleles may be recombined on the same chromosome. This is why alleles on</p><p class="s20">196                                                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 8 | Patterns of Inheritance</p><p>a given chromosome are not always inherited together. Recombination is a random event occurring anywhere on a chromosome. Therefore, genes that are far apart on the same chromosome are likely to still assort independently because of recombination events that occurred in the intervening chromosomal space.<br/>Whether or not they are sorting independently, genes may interact at the level of gene products, such that the expression of an allele for one gene masks or modifies the expression of an allele for a different gene. This is called epistasis.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p><b>1. </b><span class="s32">Figure 8.9 </span>In pea plants, round peas (<i>R</i>) are dominant to wrinkled peas (<i>r</i>).

DNA can be retrieved from hair, blood, or saliva. With the exception of identical twins, each person’s DNA is unique and it is possible to detect differences between human beings on the basis of their unique DNA sequence.<br/>DNA analysis has many practical applications beyond forensics and paternity testing. DNA testing is used for tracing genealogy and identifying pathogens. In the medical field, DNA is used in diagnostics, new vaccine development, and cancer therapy. It is now possible to determine predisposition to many diseases by analyzing genes.<br/>DNA is the genetic material passed from parent to offspring for all life on Earth. The technology of molecular genetics developed in the last half century has enabled us to see deep into the history of life to deduce the relationships between living things in ways never thought possible. It also allows us to understand the workings of evolution in populations of organisms. Over a thousand species have had their entire genome sequenced, and there have been thousands of individual human genome sequences completed. These sequences will allow us to understand human disease and the relationship of humans to the rest of the tree of life. Finally, molecular genetics techniques have revolutionized plant and animal breeding for human agricultural needs. All of these advances in biotechnology depended on basic research leading to the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, and the research since then that has uncovered the details of DNA replication and the complex process leading to the expression of DNA in the form of proteins in the cell.</p><p class="s20">200                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="91" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_288.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">9.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>The Structure of DNA</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the structure of DNA<br/>•   Describe how eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA is arranged in the cell<br/>In the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together at the University of Cambridge, England, to determine the structure of DNA. Other scientists, such as Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins, were also actively exploring this field. Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography is a method for investigating molecular structure by observing the patterns formed by X-rays shot through a crystal of the substance. The patterns give important information about the structure of the molecule of interest. In Wilkins’ lab, researcher Rosalind Franklin was using X-ray crystallography to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the DNA molecule using Franklin&#39;s data (<span class="s32">Figure 9.2</span>). Watson and Crick also had key pieces of information available from other researchers such as Chargaff’s rules. Chargaff had shown that of the four kinds of monomers (nucleotides) present in a DNA molecule, two types were always present in equal amounts and the remaining two types were also always present in equal amounts. This meant they were always paired in some way. In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work in determining the structure of DNA.<br/><span><IMG width="499" height="238" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_289.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  9.2  <span class="s30">Pioneering scientists (a)  James Watson and  Francis Crick are  pictured  here  with American  geneticist Maclyn  McCarty.

The phosphate group is attached to the 5&#39; carbon of one nucleotide and the 3&#39; carbon of the next nucleotide. In its natural state, each DNA molecule is actually composed of two single strands held together along their length with hydrogen bonds between the bases.<br/>Watson and Crick proposed that the DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right- handed helix, called a <b>double helix</b>. Base-pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine: namely, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. In other words, adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. This is the basis for Chargaff’s rule; because of their complementarity, there is as much adenine as thymine in a DNA molecule and as much guanine as cytosine. Adenine and thymine are connected by two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine and guanine are connected by three hydrogen bonds. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, one strand will have the 3&#39; carbon of the sugar in the “upward” position, whereas the other strand will have the 5&#39; carbon in the upward position. The diameter of the DNA double helix is uniform throughout because a purine (two rings) always pairs with a pyrimidine (one ring) and their combined lengths are always equal.

Like DNA, RNA is a polymer of nucleotides. Each of the nucleotides in RNA is made up of a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar, and a phosphate group. In the case of RNA, the five-carbon sugar is ribose, not deoxyribose. Ribose has a hydroxyl group at the 2&#39; carbon, unlike deoxyribose, which has only a hydrogen atom (<span class="s32">Figure 9.5</span>).</p><p class="s20">202                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology</p><p><span><IMG width="348" height="119" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_292.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  9.5 <span class="s30">The  difference between the  ribose  found  in RNA and  the  deoxyribose found  in DNA is that  ribose  has  a hydroxyl group at the 2&#39; carbon.</span></p><p>RNA nucleotides contain the nitrogenous bases adenine, cytosine, and guanine. However, they do not contain thymine, which is instead replaced by uracil, symbolized by a “U.” RNA exists as a single-stranded molecule rather than a double- stranded helix. Molecular biologists have named several kinds of RNA on the basis of their function. These include messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA)—molecules that are involved in the production of proteins from the DNA code.</p><p class="s24">How DNA Is Arranged  in the Cell</p><p>DNA is a working molecule; it must be replicated when a cell is ready to divide, and it must be “read” to produce the molecules, such as proteins, to carry out the functions of the cell. For this reason, the DNA is protected and packaged in very specific ways. In addition, DNA molecules can be very long. Stretched end-to-end, the DNA molecules in a single human cell would come to a length of about 2 meters. Thus, the DNA for a cell must be packaged in a very ordered way to fit and function within a structure (the cell) that is not visible to the naked eye. The chromosomes of prokaryotes are much simpler than those of eukaryotes in many of their features (<span class="s32">Figure 9.6</span>). Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.<br/><span><IMG width="470" height="243" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_293.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 9.6 <span class="s30">A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus, whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in the cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid.</span></p><p>The size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, <i>Escherichia coli, </i>is 4.6 million base pairs, which would extend a distance of about 1.6 mm if stretched out. So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted beyond the double helix in what is known as supercoiling. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.<br/>Eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their DNA inside the nucleus (<span class="s32">Figure 9.7</span>). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. The DNA is wrapped tightly around the histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one by a short strand of DNA that is free of histones. This is also known as the “beads on a string” structure; the nucleosomes are the “beads” and the short lengths of DNA between them are the “string.” The nucleosomes, with their DNA coiled around them, stack compactly onto each other to form a 30-nm–wide fiber. This fiber is further coiled into a thicker and more compact structure. At the metaphase stage of mitosis, when the chromosomes are lined up in the center of the cell, the chromosomes are at their most compacted. They are approximately 700 nm in width, and are found in association with scaffold proteins.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                                203</p><p>In interphase, the phase of the cell cycle between mitoses at which the chromosomes are decondensed, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining.

This is accomplished by the process of DNA replication. The replication of DNA occurs during the synthesis phase, or S phase, of the cell cycle, before the cell enters mitosis or meiosis.<br/>The elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA is copied. Recall that adenine nucleotides pair with thymine nucleotides, and cytosine with guanine. This means that the two strands are complementary to each other. For example, a strand of DNA with a nucleotide sequence of AGTCATGA will have a complementary strand with the sequence TCAGTACT (<span class="s32">Figure 9.8</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="402" height="416" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_298.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  9.8 <span class="s30">The two strands of DNA are complementary, meaning the sequence of bases in one strand can be used to create the correct  sequence of bases in the other  strand.</span></p><p>Because of the complementarity of the two strands, having one strand means that it is possible to recreate the other strand. This model for replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied (<span class="s32">Figure 9.9</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                                205</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="367" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_299.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  9.9  <span class="s30">The  semiconservative model  of DNA replication  is shown.  Gray  indicates the  original DNA strands, and blue indicates newly synthesized DNA.</span></p><p>During DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. Each new double strand consists of one parental strand and one new daughter strand. This is known as <b>semiconservative replication</b>. When two DNA copies are formed, they have an identical sequence of nucleotide bases and are divided equally into two daughter cells.</p><p class="s24">DNA Replication in Eukaryotes</p><p>Because eukaryotic genomes are very complex, DNA replication is a very complicated process that involves several enzymes and other proteins. It occurs in three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.<br/>Recall that eukaryotic DNA is bound to proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. During initiation, the DNA is made accessible to the proteins and enzymes involved in the replication process. How does the replication machinery know where on the DNA double helix to begin? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication at which replication begins. Certain proteins bind to the origin of replication while an enzyme called <b>helicase </b>unwinds and opens up the DNA helix. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped structures called <b>replication forks </b>are formed (<span class="s32">Figure 9.10</span>). Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication, and these get extended in both directions as replication proceeds. There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome, such that replication can occur simultaneously from several places in the genome.<br/>During elongation, an enzyme called <b>DNA polymerase </b>adds DNA nucleotides to the 3&#39; end of the template. Because DNA polymerase can only add new nucleotides at the end of a backbone, a <b>primer </b>sequence, which provides this starting point, is added with complementary RNA nucleotides. This primer is removed later, and the nucleotides are replaced with DNA nucleotides. One strand, which is complementary to the parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously toward the replication fork so the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the <b>leading strand</b>. Because DNA polymerase can only synthesize DNA in a 5&#39; to 3&#39; direction, the other new strand is put together in short pieces called <b>Okazaki fragments</b>. The Okazaki fragments each require a primer made of RNA to start the synthesis. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the <b>lagging strand</b>. As synthesis proceeds, an enzyme removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced with DNA nucleotides, and the gaps between fragments are sealed by an enzyme called <b>DNA ligase</b>.<br/>The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows:<br/>1.   DNA unwinds at the origin of replication.</p><p class="s20">206                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology</p><p>2.   New bases are added to the complementary parental strands. One new strand is made continuously, while the other strand is made in pieces.<br/>3.   Primers are removed, new DNA nucleotides are put in place of the primers and the backbone is sealed by DNA ligase.</p><p class="s29">Figure  9.10  <span class="s30">A replication  fork is formed  by the  opening of the  origin of replication,  and  helicase separates the DNA strands.

As you have learned, the DNA polymerase enzyme can add nucleotides in only one direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached; however, on the lagging strand there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. This presents a problem for the cell because the ends remain unpaired, and over time these ends get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide. The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as <b>telomeres</b>, which have repetitive sequences that do not code for a particular gene. As a consequence, it is telomeres that are shortened with each round of DNA replication instead of genes. For example, in humans, a six base-pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme <b>telomerase </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 9.11</span>) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the end of the DNA strand. Once the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can now add nucleotides that are complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                                207</p><p><span><IMG width="348" height="444" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_301.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 9.11 <span class="s30">The ends of linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme.</span></p><p>Telomerase is typically found to be active in germ cells, adult stem cells, and some cancer cells.

It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base. Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base, and then polymerization continues (<span class="s32">Figure 9.13</span><b>a</b>). Most mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not happen, the <b>mismatch repair </b>mechanism is employed. Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the DNA, replacing it with the correct base (<span class="s32">Figure 9.13</span><b>b</b>). In yet another type of repair, <b>nucleotide excision repair</b>, the DNA double strand is unwound and separated, the incorrect bases are removed along with a few bases on the 5&#39; and 3&#39; end, and these are replaced by copying the template with the help of DNA polymerase (<span class="s32">Figure 9.13</span><b>c</b>). Nucleotide excision repair is particularly important in correcting thymine dimers, which are primarily caused by ultraviolet light. In a thymine dimer, two thymine nucleotides adjacent to each other on one strand are covalently bonded to each other rather than their complementary bases. If the dimer is not removed and repaired it will lead to a mutation.

This module discusses the details of transcription.</p><p class="s24">The Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes Protein</p><p>The flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the central dogma (<span class="s32">Figure 9.14</span>), which states that genes specify the sequences of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequences of proteins.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="231" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_309.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 9.14 <span class="s30">The central  dogma states that DNA encodes RNA, which in turn encodes protein.</span></p><p>The copying of DNA to mRNA is relatively straightforward, with one nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every complementary nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation to protein is more complex because groups of three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid of the protein sequence. However, as we shall see in the next module, the translation to protein is still systematic, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.</p><p class="s24">Transcription: from DNA to mRNA</p><p>Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with the important difference of the membrane-bound nucleus in eukaryotes. With the genes bound in the nucleus, transcription occurs in the nucleus of the cell and the mRNA transcript must be transported to the cytoplasm. The prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, lack membrane-bound nuclei and other organelles, and transcription occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, transcription occurs in three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.</p><p class="s34">Initiation</p><p>Transcription requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis. The region of unwinding is called a <b>transcription bubble</b>. The DNA sequence onto which the proteins and enzymes involved in transcription bind to initiate the process is called a <b>promoter</b>. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all of the time, some of the time, or hardly at all (<span class="s32">Figure 9.15</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                                211</p><p><span><IMG width="348" height="164" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_310.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  9.15 <span class="s30">The initiation of transcription begins when DNA is unwound, forming a transcription bubble.

The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the <b>nontemplate strand</b>, with the exception that RNA contains a uracil (U) in place of the thymine (T) found in DNA. During elongation, an enzyme called <b>RNA polymerase </b>proceeds along the DNA template adding nucleotides by base pairing with the DNA template in a manner similar to DNA replication, with the difference that an RNA strand is being synthesized that does not remain bound to the DNA template. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it (<span class="s32">Figure 9.16</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="505" height="203" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_311.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  9.16  <span class="s30">During elongation, RNA polymerase tracks  along  the  DNA template, synthesizes mRNA in the  5&#39; to 3&#39; direction,  and unwinds  then  rewinds  the DNA as it is read.</span></p><p class="s34">Termination</p><p>Once a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA template and liberate the newly made mRNA. Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals, but both involve repeated nucleotide sequences in the DNA template that result in RNA polymerase stalling, leaving the DNA template, and freeing the mRNA transcript.<br/>On termination, the process of transcription is complete. In a prokaryotic cell, by the time termination occurs, the transcript would already have been used to partially synthesize numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur concurrently using multiple ribosomes (polyribosomes) (<span class="s32">Figure 9.17</span>). In contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation.</p><p class="s20">212                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology</p><p><span><IMG width="402" height="140" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_312.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  9.17  <span class="s30">Multiple polymerases can  transcribe a  single  bacterial gene while  numerous ribosomes concurrently translate the mRNA transcripts into polypeptides.

The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation create a molecule that is much more stable than a prokaryotic mRNA. For example, eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical prokaryotic mRNA lasts no more than five seconds.<br/>The mRNA transcript is first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins to prevent it from degrading while it is processed and exported out of the nucleus. This occurs while the pre-mRNA still is being synthesized by adding a special nucleotide “cap” to the 5&#39; end of the growing transcript. In addition to preventing degradation, factors involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.<br/>Once elongation is complete, an enzyme then adds a string of approximately 200 adenine residues to the 3&#39; end, called the poly-A tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and signals to cellular factors that the transcript needs to be exported to the cytoplasm.<br/>Eukaryotic genes are composed of protein-coding sequences called <b>exons </b>(<i>ex-</i>on signifies that they are <i>ex</i>pressed) and <i>int</i>ervening sequences called <b>introns </b>(<i>int-</i>ron denotes their <i>int</i>ervening role). Introns are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing. Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins. It is essential that all of a pre-mRNA’s introns be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis so that the exons join together to code for the correct amino acids. If the process errs by even a single nucleotide, the sequence of the rejoined exons would be shifted, and the resulting protein would be nonfunctional. The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called <b>splicing </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 9.18</span>). Introns are removed and degraded while the pre-mRNA is still in the nucleus.<br/><span><IMG width="370" height="208" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_313.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 9.18 <span class="s30">Eukaryotic  mRNA contains introns that must be spliced  out.

In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform a wide variety of the functions of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves decoding an mRNA message into a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acids to more than<br/>1,000.</p><p class="s24">The Protein  Synthesis Machinery</p><p>In addition to the mRNA template, many other molecules contribute to the process of translation. The composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of ribosomal RNAs ( <b>rRNA</b>) and polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells. Translation requires the input of an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors (<span class="s32">Figure 9.19</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="270" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_315.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 9.19 <span class="s30">The protein synthesis machinery includes the large and small subunits of the ribosome, mRNA, and tRNA. (credit: modification of work by NIGMS, NIH)</span></p><p>In <i>E. coli</i>, there are 200,000 ribosomes present in every cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.<br/>Ribosomes are located in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes. Ribosomes are made up of a large and a small subunit that come together for translation. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds <b>tRNAs</b>, a type of RNA molecule that brings amino acids to the growing chain of the polypeptide. Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction.<br/>Depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of tRNA exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to sequences on the mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually “translate” the language of RNA into the language of proteins. For each tRNA to function, it must have its specific amino acid bonded to it. In the process of tRNA “charging,” each tRNA molecule is bonded to its correct amino acid.</p><p class="s20">214                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology</p><p class="s24">The Genetic Code</p><p>To summarize what we know to this point, the cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters. Each amino acid is defined by a three- nucleotide sequence called the triplet <b>codon</b>. The relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called the <b>genetic code</b>.<br/>Given the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Using a three-nucleotide code means that there are a total of 64 (4 × 4 × 4) possible combinations; therefore, a given amino acid is encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet (<span class="s32">Figure 9.20</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="349" height="299" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_316.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 9.20 <span class="s30">This figure shows the genetic code  for translating each nucleotide triplet, or codon,  in mRNA into an amino acid or a termination signal in a nascent protein.  (credit: modification of work by NIH)</span></p><p>Three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are called <b>stop codons</b>. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the <b>start codon </b>to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5&#39; end of the mRNA. The genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis, which is powerful evidence that all life on Earth shares a common origin.</p><p class="s24">The Mechanism of Protein  Synthesis</p><p>Just as with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. The process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we will explore how translation occurs in <i>E. coli</i>, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.<br/>Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In <i>E. coli</i>, this complex involves the small ribosome subunit, the mRNA template, three initiation factors, and a special initiator tRNA. The initiator tRNA interacts with the AUG start codon, and links to a special form of the amino acid methionine that is typically removed from the polypeptide after translation is complete.<br/>In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of polypeptide elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of <i>E. coli</i>. The large ribosomal subunit of <i>E. coli </i>consists of three compartments: the A site binds incoming charged tRNAs (tRNAs with their attached specific amino acids). The P site binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA. The E site releases dissociated tRNAs so they can be recharged with free amino acids. The ribosome shifts one codon at a time, catalyzing each process that occurs in the three sites. With each step, a charged tRNA enters the complex, the polypeptide becomes one amino acid longer, and an uncharged tRNA departs. The energy for each bond between amino acids is derived from GTP, a molecule similar to ATP (<span class="s32">Figure 9.21</span>). Amazingly, the <i>E. coli </i>translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid polypeptide could be translated in just 10 seconds.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology                                                                                                                                                                                                                215</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="553" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_317.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 9.21 <span class="s30">Translation begins when a tRNA anticodon recognizes a codon  on the mRNA.

All organisms and cells control or regulate the transcription and translation of their DNA into protein. The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein is called <b>gene expression</b>. Whether in a simple unicellular organism or in a complex multicellular organism, each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed. For this to occur, there must be a mechanism to control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no longer needed.<br/>Cells in multicellular organisms are specialized; cells in different tissues look very different and perform different functions. For example, a muscle cell is very different from a liver cell, which is very different from a skin cell. These differences are a consequence of the expression of different sets of genes in each of these cells. All cells have certain basic functions they must perform for themselves, such as converting the energy in sugar molecules into energy in ATP. Each cell also has many genes that are not expressed, and expresses many that are not expressed by other cells, such that it can carry out its specialized functions. In addition, cells will turn on or off certain genes at different times in response to changes in the environment or at different times during the development of the organism. Unicellular organisms, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, also turn on and off genes in response to the demands of their environment so that they can respond to special conditions.<br/>The control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell and can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer.</p><p class="s24">Prokaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene  Expression</p><p>To understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene becomes a functional protein in a cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different fashions.<br/>Because  prokaryotic  organisms  lack  a  cell  nucleus,  the  processes  of  transcription  and  translation  occur  almost simultaneously. When the protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the primary method to control what type and how much protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is through the regulation of DNA transcription into RNA. All the subsequent steps happen automatically. When more protein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression is almost entirely at the transcriptional level.<br/>The first example of such control was discovered using <i>E</i>. <i>coli </i>in the 1950s and 1960s by French researchers and is called the <i>lac </i>operon. The <i>lac </i>operon is a stretch of DNA with three adjacent genes that code for proteins that participate in the absorption and metabolism of lactose, a food source for <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. When lactose is not present in the bacterium’s environment, the <i>lac </i>genes are transcribed in small amounts. When lactose is present, the genes are transcribed and the bacterium is able to use the lactose as a food source. The operon also contains a promoter sequence to which the RNA polymerase binds to begin transcription; between the promoter and the three genes is a region called the operator. When there is no lactose present, a protein known as a repressor binds to the operator and prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, except in rare cases. Thus very little of the protein products of the three genes is made. When lactose is present, an end product of lactose metabolism binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from binding to the operator. This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and freely transcribe the three genes, allowing the organism to metabolize the lactose.<br/>Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles and are much more complex. Recall that in eukaryotic cells, the DNA is contained inside the cell’s nucleus and it is transcribed into mRNA there. The newly synthesized mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the mRNA into protein. The processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation only occurs outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (<span class="s32">Figure 9.22</span>).

Alternative  RNA splicing is  a  mechanism that  allows  different  protein   products to  be  produced from  one  gene when  different combinations of  introns   (and   sometimes  exons) are   removed from  the  transcript (<span class="s32">Figure   9.23</span>).   This alternative splicing  can  be  haphazard, but  more  often  it is controlled  and  acts  as a  mechanism of gene regulation, with the frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled  by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein  products in different cells,  or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70% of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through  alternative splicing.</p><p class="s29">Figure 9.23 <span class="s30">There  are five basic  modes of alternative splicing. Segments of pre-mRNA with exons shown  in blue, red, orange, and pink can be spliced  to produce a variety of new mature mRNA segments.</span></p><p>How could alternative splicing evolve? Introns have  a beginning and  ending  recognition sequence,  and  it is easy to imagine  the failure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and find the end of the next intron, thus  removing  two introns  and  the intervening exon.  In fact, there  are  mechanisms in place  to prevent such  exon skipping, but mutations are likely to lead to their failure. Such  “mistakes” would more than likely produce a nonfunctional protein.  Indeed, the  cause of many  genetic diseases is alternative splicing rather  than mutations in a sequence. However,  alternative splicing would create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein,  opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new variant to new functions.  Gene duplication  has  played  an  important  role in the  evolution  of new  functions  in a similar way—by  providing genes that may evolve without eliminating  the original functional protein.</p><p class="s20">220                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology</p><p class="s24">KEY TERMS</p><p class="s27">alternative RNA splicing <span class="p">a post-transcriptional gene regulation mechanism in eukaryotes in which multiple  protein products are produced by a single gene through alternative splicing combinations of the RNA transcript</span></p><p class="s27">codon <span class="p">three consecutive nucleotides in mRNA that specify the addition of a specific amino acid or the release  of a polypeptide chain during translation</span></p><p class="s27">deoxyribose <span class="p">a five-carbon sugar molecule with a hydrogen atom rather than a hydroxyl group in the 2&#39;

The DNA molecule is a polymer of nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose), and a phosphate group. There are four nitrogenous bases in DNA, two purines (adenine and guanine) and two pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine). A DNA molecule is composed of two strands. Each strand is composed of nucleotides bonded together covalently between the phosphate group of one and the deoxyribose sugar of the next. From this backbone extend the bases. The bases of one strand bond to the bases of the second strand with hydrogen bonds. Adenine always bonds with thymine, and cytosine always bonds with guanine. The bonding causes the two strands to spiral around each other in a shape called a double<br/>helix. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a second nucleic acid found in cells. RNA is a single-stranded polymer of nucleotides. It also differs from DNA in that it contains the sugar ribose, rather than deoxyribose, and the nucleotide uracil rather than thymine. Various RNA molecules function in the process of forming proteins from the genetic code in DNA.<br/>Prokaryotes contain a single, double-stranded circular chromosome. Eukaryotes contain double-stranded linear DNA molecules packaged into chromosomes. The DNA helix is wrapped around proteins to form nucleosomes. The protein coils are further coiled, and during mitosis and meiosis, the chromosomes become even more greatly coiled to facilitate their movement. Chromosomes have two distinct regions which can be distinguished by staining, reflecting different degrees of packaging and determined by whether the DNA in a region is being expressed (euchromatin) or not (heterochromatin).</p><p class="s52">9.2 DNA Replication</p><p>DNA replicates by a semi-conservative method in which each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new<br/>DNA to be synthesized. After replication, each DNA has one parental or “old” strand, and one daughter or “new” strand.<br/>Replication in eukaryotes starts at multiple origins of replication, while replication in prokaryotes starts from a single origin of replication. The DNA is opened with enzymes, resulting in the formation of the replication fork. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer to initiate synthesis by DNA polymerase, which can add nucleotides in only one direction.</p><p class="s20">222                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9 | Molecular Biology</p><p>One strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork; this is called the leading strand. The other strand is synthesized in a direction away from the replication fork, in short stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments. This strand is known as the lagging strand. Once replication is completed, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA nucleotides and the DNA is sealed with DNA ligase.<br/>The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes pose a problem, as polymerase is unable to extend them without a primer. Telomerase, an enzyme with an inbuilt RNA template, extends the ends by copying the RNA template and extending one end of the chromosome. DNA polymerase can then extend the DNA using the primer. In this way, the ends of the chromosomes are protected. Cells have mechanisms for repairing DNA when it becomes damaged or errors are made in replication. These mechanisms include mismatch repair to replace nucleotides that are paired with a non-complementary base and nucleotide excision repair, which removes bases that are damaged such as thymine dimers.</p><p class="s52">9.3 Transcription</p><p>In prokaryotes, mRNA synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the DNA template. Elongation synthesizes new mRNA. Termination liberates the mRNA and occurs by mechanisms that stall the RNA polymerase and cause it to fall off the DNA template. Newly transcribed eukaryotic mRNAs are modified with a cap and a poly-A tail. These structures protect the mature mRNA from degradation and help export it from the nucleus. Eukaryotic mRNAs also undergo splicing, in which introns are removed and exons are reconnected with single-nucleotide accuracy. Only finished mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.</p><p class="s52">9.4 Translation</p><p>The central dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from genes to mRNA to proteins. Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the process of translation. The genetic code is the correspondence between the three-nucleotide mRNA codon and an amino acid. The genetic code is “translated” by the tRNA molecules, which associate a specific codon with a specific amino acid. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and three stop codons. This means that more than one codon corresponds to an amino acid. Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.<br/>The players in translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors. The small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA template. Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the mRNA. The formation of bonds occurs between sequential amino acids specified by the mRNA template according to the genetic code. The ribosome accepts charged tRNAs, and as it steps along the mRNA, it catalyzes bonding between the new amino acid and the end of the growing polypeptide. The entire mRNA is translated in three-nucleotide “steps” of the ribosome. When a stop codon is encountered, a release factor binds and dissociates the components and frees the new protein.</p><p class="s52">9.5 How Genes Are Regulated</p><p>While all somatic cells within an organism contain the same DNA, not all cells within that organism express the same proteins. Prokaryotic organisms express the entire DNA they encode in every cell, but not necessarily all at the same time. Proteins are expressed only when they are needed. Eukaryotic organisms express a subset of the DNA that is encoded in any given cell. In each cell type, the type and amount of protein is regulated by controlling gene expression. To express a protein, the DNA is first transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. In prokaryotic cells, these processes occur almost simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus and is separate from the translation that occurs in the cytoplasm. Gene expression in prokaryotes is regulated only at the transcriptional level, whereas in eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post- translational levels.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 9.10 </span><span class="p">You isolate a cell strain in which the joining together of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that a mutation has occurred in an enzyme found at</span></p><p>the replication fork.

The rate of discovery and of the development of new applications in medicine, agriculture, and energy is expected to accelerate, bringing huge benefits to humankind and perhaps also significant risks.

Biotechnology has been used for improving livestock and crops since the beginning of agriculture through selective breeding. Since the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, and particularly since the development of tools and methods to manipulate DNA in the 1970s, biotechnology has become synonymous with the manipulation of organisms’ DNA at the molecular level. The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (for the production of vaccines and antibiotics) and in agriculture (for the genetic modification of crops). Biotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as fermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the production of biofuels, as well as many household applications such as the use of enzymes in laundry detergent.</span></p><p class="s20">226                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 10 | Biotechnology</p><p class="s24">Manipulating  Genetic Material</p><p>To accomplish the applications described above, biotechnologists must be able to extract, manipulate, and analyze nucleic acids.</p><p class="s34">Review of Nucleic Acid  Structure</p><p>To understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids, remember that nucleic acids are macromolecules made of nucleotides (a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base). The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus of eukaryotic organisms is called the genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases.<br/>Unlike DNA in eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the nucleus. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is analyzed most frequently because it represents the protein-coding genes that are being expressed in the cell.</p><p class="s34">Isolation of Nucleic Acids</p><p>To study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA must first be extracted from cells. Various techniques are used to extract different types of DNA (<span class="s32">Figure 10.2</span>). Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell, and then the use of enzymatic reactions to destroy all undesired macromolecules. Cells are broken open using a detergent solution containing buffering compounds. To prevent degradation and contamination, macromolecules such as proteins and RNA are inactivated using enzymes. The DNA is then brought out of solution using alcohol. The resulting DNA, because it is made up of long polymers, forms a gelatinous mass.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="298" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_327.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 10.2 <span class="s30">This diagram shows the basic  method used for the extraction of DNA.</span></p><p>RNA is studied to understand gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because enzymes that break down RNA are commonly present in nature. Some are even secreted by our own skin and are very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA extraction, RNA extraction involves the use of various buffers and enzymes to inactivate other macromolecules and preserve only the RNA.</p><p class="s34">Gel Electrophoresis</p><p>Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or alkaline pH in an aqueous environment, they can be moved by an electric field. <b>Gel electrophoresis </b>is a technique used to separate charged molecules on the basis of size and charge. The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or as fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot at one end of a gel matrix, an electric current is applied, and negatively charged molecules are pulled toward the opposite end of the gel (the end with the positive electrode). Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. The nucleic acids in a gel matrix are invisible until they are stained with a compound that allows them to be seen, such as a dye. Distinct fragments of nucleic acids appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) that are based on their size (<span class="s32">Figure 10.3</span>). A mixture of many fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 10 | Biotechnology                                                                                                                                                                                       227</p><p><span><IMG width="402" height="391" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_328.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 10.3 <span class="s30">Shown  are DNA fragments from six samples run on a gel, stained with a fluorescent dye and viewed under</span></p><p class="s30">UV light.

It also frequently involves situations in which only one or a few copies of a DNA molecule are available for further analysis. These amounts are insufficient for most procedures, such as gel electrophoresis. <b>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </b>is a technique used to rapidly increase the number of copies of specific regions of DNA for further analyses (<span class="s32">Figure 10.4</span>). PCR uses a special form of DNA polymerase, the enzyme that replicates DNA, and other short nucleotide sequences called primers that base pair to a specific portion of the DNA being replicated. PCR is used for many purposes in laboratories. These include: 1) the identification of the owner of a DNA sample left at a crime scene; 2) paternity analysis; 3) the comparison of small amounts of ancient DNA with modern organisms; and 4) determining the sequence of nucleotides in a specific region.</p><p class="s20">228                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 10 | Biotechnology</p><p><span><IMG width="322" height="565" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_329.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 10.4 <span class="s30">Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR,  is used to produce many copies of a specific sequence of DNA using</span></p><p class="s30">a special form of DNA polymerase.</p><p class="s24">Cloning</p><p>In general, <b>cloning </b>means the creation of a perfect replica. Typically, the word is used to describe the creation of a genetically identical copy. In biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as “reproductive cloning.” Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to copy short stretches of DNA—a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.</p><p class="s34">Molecular Cloning</p><p>Cloning allows for the creation of multiple copies of genes, expression of genes, and study of specific genes. To get the DNA fragment into a bacterial cell in a form that will be copied or expressed, the fragment is first inserted into a plasmid. A <b>plasmid </b>(also called a vector in this context) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA in bacteria. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a &quot;vehicle&quot; in which to insert a desired DNA fragment. Modified plasmids are usually reintroduced into a bacterial host for replication. As the bacteria divide, they copy their own DNA (including the plasmids). The inserted DNA fragment is copied along with the rest of the bacterial DNA. In a bacterial cell, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or another organism that is being studied) is referred to as foreign DNA to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium (the host DNA).<br/>Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been highly engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and for the subsequent large-scale production of important molecules, such as<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 10 | Biotechnology                                                                                                                                                                                       229</p><p>insulin. A valuable characteristic of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced. These plasmid vectors contain many short DNA sequences that can be cut with different commonly available <b>restriction enzymes</b>. Restriction enzymes (also called restriction endonucleases) recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many restriction enzymes make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have a 2- to 4-nucleotide single- stranded overhang. The sequence that is recognized by the restriction enzyme is a four- to eight-nucleotide sequence that is a palindrome. Like with a word palindrome, this means the sequence reads the same forward and backward. In most cases, the sequence reads the same forward on one strand and backward on the complementary strand. When a staggered cut is made in a sequence like this, the overhangs are complementary (<span class="s32">Figure 10.5</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="232" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_330.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  10.5  <span class="s30">In this (a) six-nucleotide restriction  enzyme recognition site,  notice  that  the  sequence of six nucleotides reads the same in the 5&#39; to 3&#39; direction  on one  strand as it does in the 5&#39; to 3&#39; direction  on the complementary strand. This is known  as a palindrome. (b) The  restriction  enzyme makes breaks in the  DNA strands, and  (c) the  cut in the DNA results in “sticky ends”.  Another  piece  of DNA cut on either  end  by the same restriction  enzyme could attach to these sticky ends and be inserted into the gap made by this cut.</span></p><p>Because these overhangs are capable of coming back together by hydrogen bonding with complementary overhangs on a piece of DNA cut with the same restriction enzyme, these are called “sticky ends.” The process of forming hydrogen bonds between complementary sequences on single strands to form double-stranded DNA is called <b>annealing</b>. Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase, which takes part in DNA replication in cells, permanently joins the DNA fragments when the sticky ends come together. In this way, any DNA fragment can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction enzyme (<span class="s32">Figure 10.6</span>).</p><p class="s20">230                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 10 | Biotechnology</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="684" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_331.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 10.6 <span class="s30">This diagram shows the steps involved in molecular cloning.</span></p><p>Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called <b>recombinant DNA </b>molecules because they contain new combinations of genetic material. Proteins that are produced from recombinant DNA molecules are called <b>recombinant proteins</b>. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes. Plasmids may also be engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so that scientists can control the expression of the recombinant proteins.</p><p class="s34">Reproductive Cloning</p><p class="s27">Reproductive cloning <span class="p">is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves the contribution of DNA from two individuals (parents), making it impossible to generate an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to reproductively clone mammals in the laboratory.</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 10 | Biotechnology                                                                                                                                                                                       231</p><p>Natural sexual reproduction involves the union, during fertilization, of a sperm and an egg. Each of these gametes is haploid, meaning they contain one set of chromosomes in their nuclei. The resulting cell, or zygote, is then diploid and contains two sets of chromosomes. This cell divides mitotically to produce a multicellular organism. However, the union of just any two cells cannot produce a viable zygote; there are components in the cytoplasm of the egg cell that are essential for the early development of the embryo during its first few cell divisions. Without these provisions, there would be no subsequent development. Therefore, to produce a new individual, both a diploid genetic complement and an egg cytoplasm are required. The approach to producing an artificially cloned individual is to take the egg cell of one individual and to remove the haploid nucleus. Then a diploid nucleus from a body cell of a second individual, the donor, is put into the egg cell. The egg is then stimulated to divide so that development proceeds. This sounds simple, but in fact it takes many attempts before each of the steps is completed successfully.<br/>The first cloned agricultural animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. Dolly lived for six years and died of a lung tumor (<span class="s32">Figure 10.7</span>). There was speculation that because the cell DNA that gave rise to Dolly came from an older individual, the age of the DNA may have affected her life expectancy. Since Dolly, several species of animals (such as horses, bulls, and goats) have been successfully cloned.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="518" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_332.png"/></span><br/>There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells. In the procedure, the DNA from an adult human is introduced into a human egg cell, which is then stimulated to divide. The technology is similar to the technology that was used to produce Dolly, but the embryo is never implanted into a surrogate mother. The cells produced are called embryonic stem cells because they have the capacity to develop into many different kinds of cells, such as muscle or nerve cells. The stem cells could be used to research and ultimately provide therapeutic applications, such as replacing damaged tissues. The benefit of cloning in this instance is that the cells used to regenerate new tissues would be a perfect match to the donor of the original DNA. For example, a leukemia patient would not require a sibling with a tissue match for a bone-marrow transplant.</p><p class="s29">Figure  10.7  <span class="s30">Dolly the  sheep was  the  first agricultural  animal  to be  cloned.  To create Dolly, the  nucleus was removed from a donor egg cell. The enucleated egg was  placed next to the other  cell, then  they were shocked to fuse.  They  were  shocked again  to start  division. The cells  were  allowed  to divide for several days  until an early embryonic  stage was reached, before  being implanted in a surrogate mother.</span></p><p>Why was Dolly a Finn-Dorset and not a Scottish Blackface sheep?</p><p class="s20">232                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 10 | Biotechnology</p><p class="s24">Genetic Engineering</p><p><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_333.jpg"/></span><br/>Using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism’s DNA to achieve desirable traits is called <b>genetic engineering</b>. Addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors that are generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. An organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a <b>genetically modified organism </b>(GMO). If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called <b>transgenic</b>. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. These applications will be examined in more detail in the next module.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_334.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/transgenic" class="s25">Watch this </a>short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/transgenic) <span class="p">explaining how scientists create a transgenic animal. Although the classic methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic</span></p><p>basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: &quot;What does this gene or DNA element do?&quot; This technique, called <b>reverse genetics</b>, has resulted in reversing the classical genetic methodology. One example of this method is analogous to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the wing’s function is flight. The classic genetic method compares insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observes that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly in a reverse genetics approach, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. Alternately, reverse genetics can be used to cause a gene to overexpress itself to determine what phenotypic effects may occur.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="91" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_335.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">10.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe uses of biotechnology in medicine<br/>•   Describe uses of biotechnology in agriculture<br/>It is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes. Knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species, the genetic basis of heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant genes provides methods to treat diseases. Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pests, and environmental stress to improve both crop yield and quality.</p><p class="s24">Genetic Diagnosis and Gene  Therapy</p><p>The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing. In some cases in which a genetic disease is present in an individual’s family, family members may be advised to undergo genetic testing. For example, mutations in the <i>BRCA </i>genes may increase the likelihood of developing breast and ovarian cancers in women and some other cancers in women and men. A woman with breast cancer can be screened for these mutations. If one of the high-risk mutations is found, her female relatives may also wish to be screened for that particular mutation, or simply be more vigilant for the occurrence of cancers. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 10 | Biotechnology                                                                                                                                                                                       233</p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_336.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_337.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/DNA_extraction" class="s25">See how </a>human DNA is extracted (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/DNA_extraction) <span class="p">for uses such as genetic testing.</span></p><p><b>Gene therapy </b>is a genetic engineering technique that may one day be used to cure certain genetic diseases. In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a non-mutated gene at a random location in the genome to cure a disease by replacing a protein that may be absent in these individuals because of a genetic mutation. The non-mutated gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus, such as an adenovirus, that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign DNA into the genome of the targeted cell (<span class="s32">Figure 10.8</span>). To date, gene therapies have been primarily experimental procedures in humans. A few of these experimental treatments have been successful, but the methods may be important in the future as the factors limiting its success are resolved.<br/><span><IMG width="450" height="338" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_338.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  10.8  <span class="s30">This diagram shows the steps involved in curing disease with gene therapy using  an adenovirus vector.

Modern techniques use specific genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors and mass-produced in bacteria to make large quantities of specific substances to stimulate the immune system. The substance is then used as a vaccine. In some cases, such as the H1N1 flu vaccine, genes cloned from the virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.<br/>Antibiotics kill bacteria and are naturally produced by microorganisms such as fungi; penicillin is perhaps the most well- known example. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells. The fungal cells have typically been genetically modified to improve the yields of the antibiotic compound.<br/>Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of the human hormone insulin in <i>E. coli </i>as early as 1978. Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in many humans because of differences in the insulin molecule. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders</p><p class="s20">234                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 10 | Biotechnology</p><p>in children.

For this reason, genes have been cloned and expressed in animals such as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice.

The artificial introduction of DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells because of the thick plant cell wall. Researchers used the natural transfer of DNA from <i>Agrobacterium </i>to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their choice into plant hosts. In nature, the disease-causing <i>A. tumefaciens </i>have a set of plasmids that contain genes that integrate into the infected plant cell’s genome.

The crystal toxin genes have been cloned from the bacterium and introduced into plants, therefore allowing plants to produce their own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects. Bt toxin is safe for the environment and non-toxic to mammals (including humans). As a result, it has been approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide. There is some concern, however, that insects may evolve resistance to the Bt toxin in the same way that bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics.</span></p><p class="s34">FlavrSavr Tomato</p><p>The first GM crop to be introduced into the market was the FlavrSavr Tomato produced in 1994.

The FlavrSavr tomato did not successfully stay in the market because of problems maintaining and shipping the crop.</p><p class="s20">236                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 10 | Biotechnology</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_341.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">10.3 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Genomics and Proteomics</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Define genomics and proteomics<br/>•   Define whole genome sequencing<br/>•   Explain different applications of genomics and proteomics<br/>The study of nucleic acids began with the discovery of DNA, progressed to the study of genes and small fragments, and has now exploded to the field of <b>genomics</b>. Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species. The advances in genomics have been made possible by DNA sequencing technology. Just as information technology has led to Google Maps that enable us to get detailed information about locations around the globe, genomic information is used to create similar maps of the DNA of different organisms.</p><p class="s24">Mapping Genomes</p><p>Genome mapping is the process of finding the location of genes on each chromosome. The maps that are created are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A <b>genetic map </b>is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that shows genetic linkage with a trait of interest. The genetic marker tends to be inherited with the gene of interest, and one measure of distance between them is the recombination frequency during meiosis. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis.</p><p class="s27">Physical maps <span class="p">get into the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map) (</span><span style=" color: #C63;">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">10.11<span class="p">). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis, to name a few. In addition, genome mapping can be used to help identify organisms with beneficial traits, such as microbes with the ability to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to methods that produce higher crop yields or to the development of plants that adapt better to climate change.</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 10 | Biotechnology                                                                                                                                                                                       237</p><p><span><IMG width="250" height="576" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_342.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 10.11  <span class="s30">This is a physical  map  of the human X chromosome.

It is easy to understand why both types of genome-mapping techniques are important to show the big picture. Information obtained from each technique is used in combination to study the genome. Genomic mapping is used with different model organisms that are used for research. Genome mapping is still an ongoing process, and as more advanced techniques are developed, more advances are expected. Genome mapping is similar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of available data. Mapping information generated in laboratories all over the world is entered into central databases, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Efforts are made to make the information more easily accessible to researchers and the general public. Just as we use global positioning systems instead of paper maps to navigate through roadways, NCBI allows us to use a genome viewer tool to simplify the data mining process.</p><p class="s20">238                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 10 | Biotechnology</p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_343.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_344.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s32">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/OMIM2) <span class="p">is a searchable online catalog of human genes and genetic disorders.

Whole genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. Several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and interpret entire genomes.<br/>In 2010, whole genome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally, a whole genome sequence revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). A bone marrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the first person to be successfully diagnosed using whole genome sequencing.<br/>The first genomes to be sequenced, such as those belonging to viruses, bacteria, and yeast, were smaller in terms of the number of nucleotides than the genomes of multicellular organisms. The genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>), the fruit fly (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), and the nematode (<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>) are now known. A great deal of basic research is performed in <b>model organisms </b>because the information can be applied to other organisms. A model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species that can be represented by the model organism. For example, fruit flies are able to metabolize alcohol like humans, so the genes affecting sensitivity to alcohol have been studied in fruit flies in an effort to understand the variation in sensitivity to alcohol in humans. Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">10.12<span class="p">).</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 10 | Biotechnology                                                                                                                                                                                       239</p><p><span><IMG width="449" height="294" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_345.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  10.12  </span>Much  basic  research is  done  with model  organisms, such   as the  mouse, <i>Mus  musculus</i>; the  fruit fly, <i>Drosophila  melanogaster</i>; the  nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>; the  yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>; and  the common weed, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.

The number of whole genomes that have been sequenced steadily increases and now includes hundreds of species and thousands of individual human genomes.</p><p class="s24">Applying Genomics</p><p>The introduction of DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the Human Genome Project, has expanded the applicability of DNA sequence information. Genomics is now being used in a wide variety of fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial genomics. The most commonly known application of genomics is to understand and find cures for diseases.</p><p class="s34">Predicting Disease Risk  at the Individual Level</p><p>Predicting the risk of disease involves screening and identifying currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level. Intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset. However, this approach is most applicable when the problem arises from a single gene mutation. Such defects only account for about 5 percent of diseases found in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multifactorial or polygenic, which refers to a phenotypic characteristic that is determined by two or more genes, and also environmental factors such as diet. In April 2010, scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. A risk assessment was done to analyze Quake’s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. A rare genetic mutation was found that showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. He was also predicted to have a 23 percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The scientists used databases and several publications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools are becoming more reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level remain to be addressed. For example, could such data be legitimately used to charge more or less for insurance or to affect credit ratings?</p><p class="s34">Genome-wide Association Studies</p><p>Since 2005, it has been possible to conduct a type of study called a genome-wide association study, or GWAS. A GWAS is a method that identifies differences between individuals in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be involved in causing diseases. The method is particularly suited to diseases that may be affected by one or many genetic changes throughout the genome. It is very difficult to identify the genes involved in such a disease using family history information. The GWAS method relies on a genetic database that has been in development since 2002 called the International HapMap Project. The HapMap Project sequenced the genomes of several hundred individuals from around the world and identified groups of SNPs. The groups include SNPs that are located near to each other on chromosomes so they tend to stay together</p><p class="s20">240                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 10 | Biotechnology</p><p>through recombination. The fact that the group stays together means that identifying one marker SNP is all that is needed to identify all the SNPs in the group. There are several million SNPs identified, but identifying them in other individuals who have not had their complete genome sequenced is much easier because only the marker SNPs need to be identified.<br/>In a common design for a GWAS, two groups of individuals are chosen; one group has the disease, and the other group does not. The individuals in each group are matched in other characteristics to reduce the effect of confounding variables causing differences between the two groups. For example, the genotypes may differ because the two groups are mostly taken from different parts of the world. Once the individuals are chosen, and typically their numbers are a thousand or more for the study to work, samples of their DNA are obtained. The DNA is analyzed using automated systems to identify large differences in the percentage of particular SNPs between the two groups. Often the study examines a million or more SNPs in the DNA. The results of GWAS can be used in two ways: the genetic differences may be used as markers for susceptibility to the disease in undiagnosed individuals, and the particular genes identified can be targets for research into the molecular pathway of the disease and potential therapies. An offshoot of the discovery of gene associations with disease has been the formation of companies that provide so-called “personal genomics” that will identify risk levels for various diseases based on an individual’s SNP complement. The science behind these services is controversial.<br/>Because GWAS looks for associations between genes and disease, these studies provide data for other research into causes, rather than answering specific questions themselves. An association between a gene difference and a disease does not necessarily mean there is a cause-and-effect relationship. However, some studies have provided useful information about the genetic causes of diseases. For example, three different studies in 2005 identified a gene for a protein involved in regulating inflammation in the body that is associated with a disease-causing blindness called age-related macular degeneration. This opened up new possibilities for research into the cause of this disease. A large number of genes have been identified to be associated with Crohn’s disease using GWAS, and some of these have suggested new hypothetical mechanisms for the cause of the disease.</p><p class="s34">Pharmacogenomics</p><p class="s27">Pharmacogenomics <span class="p">involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual&#39;s genomic sequence. Personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of the individual patient’s genotype. Studying changes in gene expression could provide information about the gene transcription profile in the presence of the drug, which can be used as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of cancerous cells. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.</span></p><p class="s34">Metagenomics</p><p>Traditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. On the other hand, many species resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms. <b>Metagenomics </b>is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment (<span class="s32">Figure 10.13</span>). Metagenomics techniques can now also be applied to communities of higher eukaryotes, such as fish.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 10 | Biotechnology                                                                                                                                                                                       241</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="306" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_346.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  10.13  <span class="s30">Metagenomics involves  isolating  DNA from multiple species within an environmental niche.

Another feature that makes studying the mitochondrial genome interesting is that in most multicellular organisms, the mitochondrial DNA is passed on from the mother during the process of fertilization. For this reason, mitochondrial genomics is often used to trace genealogy.</p><p class="s34">Genomics in Forensic Analysis</p><p>Information and clues obtained from DNA samples found at crime scenes have been used as evidence in court cases, and genetic markers have been used in forensic analysis. Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field. In 2001, the first use of genomics in forensics was published. It was a collaborative effort between academic research institutions and the FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax (<span class="s32">Figure 10.15</span>) that was transported by the US Postal Service. Anthrax bacteria were made into an infectious powder and mailed to news media and two U.S. Senators. The powder infected the administrative staff and postal workers who opened or handled the letters. Five people died, and 17 were sickened from the bacteria. Using microbial genomics, researchers determined that a specific strain of anthrax was used in all the mailings; eventually, the source was traced to a scientist at a national biodefense laboratory in Maryland.<br/><span><IMG width="278" height="275" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_348.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  10.15  <span class="s35">Bacillus anthracis  </span><span class="s30">is the organism that causes anthrax.

Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different organism to create a new genetically modified organism, as described in the previous module. Scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production. For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 10 | Biotechnology                                                                                                                                                                                       243</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="240" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_349.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 10.16 <span class="s30">Transgenic agricultural  plants  can be made to resist  disease.

Proteins are composed of amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins and act as catalysts that affect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In the diseased state, protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein.<br/>A proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type. Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. The study of the function of proteomes is called <b>proteomics</b>. Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes. Even though all cells in a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternatively spliced (cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins), and many proteins are modified after translation. Although the genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the proteome.<br/>Genomes and proteomes of patients suffering from specific diseases are being studied to understand the genetic basis of the disease. The most prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer (<span class="s32">Figure 10.17</span>). Proteomic approaches are being used to improve the screening and early detection of cancer; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process. An individual protein is called a <b>biomarker</b>, whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a <b>protein signature</b>. For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer, it must be secreted in body fluids such as sweat, blood, or urine, so that large-scale screenings can be performed in a noninvasive fashion. The current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false-negative results. A false-negative result is a negative test result that should have been positive. In other words, many cases of cancer go undetected, which makes biomarkers unreliable. Some examples of protein biomarkers used in cancer detection are CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer. Protein signatures may be more reliable than biomarkers to detect cancer cells. Proteomics is also being used to develop individualized treatment plans, which involves the prediction of whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side effects that the individual may have. Proteomics is also being used to predict the possibility of disease recurrence.</p><p class="s20">244                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 10 | Biotechnology</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="240" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_350.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  10.17  <span class="s30">This  machine is preparing to do  a  proteomic pattern analysis to identify specific  cancers so  that  an accurate cancer prognosis can be made.

Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size by gel electrophoresis. Short stretches of DNA can be amplified by PCR. DNA can be cut (and subsequently re-spliced together) using restriction enzymes. The molecular and cellular techniques of biotechnology allow researchers to genetically engineer organisms, modifying them to achieve desirable traits.<br/>Cloning may involve cloning small DNA fragments (molecular cloning), or cloning entire organisms (reproductive cloning). In molecular cloning with bacteria, a desired DNA fragment is inserted into a bacterial plasmid using restriction enzymes and the plasmid is taken up by a bacterium, which will then express the foreign DNA. Using other techniques, foreign genes can be inserted into eukaryotic organisms. In each case, the organisms are called transgenic organisms. In reproductive cloning, a donor nucleus is put into an enucleated egg cell, which is then stimulated to divide and develop into an organism.<br/>In reverse genetics methods, a gene is mutated or removed in some way to identify its effect on the phenotype of the whole organism as a way to determine its function.</p><p class="s52">10.2 Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture</p><p>Genetic testing is performed to identify disease-causing genes, and can be used to benefit affected individuals and their relatives who have not developed disease symptoms yet. Gene therapy—by which functioning genes are incorporated into the genomes of individuals with a non-functioning mutant gene—has the potential to cure heritable diseases. Transgenic organisms possess DNA from a different species, usually generated by molecular cloning techniques. Vaccines, antibiotics, and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA technology. Transgenic animals have been created for experimental purposes and some are used to produce some human proteins.<br/>Genes are inserted into plants, using plasmids in the bacterium <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>, which infects plants. Transgenic plants have been created to improve the characteristics of crop plants—for example, by giving them insect resistance by inserting a gene for a bacterial toxin.</p><p class="s52">10.3 Genomics and Proteomics</p><p>Genome mapping is similar to solving a big, complicated puzzle with pieces of information coming from laboratories all over the world. Genetic maps provide an outline for the location of genes within a genome, and they estimate the distance between genes and genetic markers on the basis of the recombination frequency during meiosis. Physical maps provide detailed information about the physical distance between the genes. The most detailed information is available through sequence mapping. Information from all mapping and sequencing sources is combined to study an entire genome.<br/>Whole genome sequencing is the latest available resource to treat genetic diseases. Some doctors are using whole genome sequencing to save lives. Genomics has many industrial applications, including biofuel development, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and pollution control.<br/>Imagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. Genomics is being applied to most fields of biology; it can be used for personalized medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, the study of drug interactions before the conduction of clinical trials, and the study of microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. It is also being applied to the generation of new biofuels, genealogical assessment using mitochondria, advances in forensic science, and improvements in agriculture.<br/>Proteomics is the study of the entire set of proteins expressed by a given type of cell under certain environmental conditions. In a multicellular organism, different cell types will have different proteomes, and these will vary with changes in the environment. Unlike a genome, a proteome is dynamic and under constant flux, which makes it more complicated and more useful than the knowledge of genomes alone.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 10.7 </span><span class="p">Why was Dolly a Finn-Dorset and not a</span></p><p>Scottish Blackface sheep?<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 10 | Biotechnology                                                                                                                                                                                       247</p><p class="s24">REVIEW QUESTIONS</p><p><b>2. </b>In gel electrophoresis of DNA, the different bands in the final gel form because the DNA molecules <u>              </u> .<br/>a.   are from different organisms<br/>b.   have different lengths<br/>c.   have different nucleotide compositions<br/>d.   have different genes<br/><b>3. </b>In the reproductive cloning of an animal, the genome of the cloned individual comes from <u>              </u> .<br/>a.   a sperm cell<br/>b.   an egg cell<br/>c.   any gamete cell<br/>d.   a body cell</p><p class="s27">4. <span class="p">What carries a gene from one organism into a bacteria cell?</span></p><p>a.   a plasmid<br/>b.   an electrophoresis gel<br/>c.   a restriction enzyme<br/>d.   polymerase chain reaction</p><p class="s27">5. <span class="p">What is a genetically modified organism (GMO)?</span></p><p>a.   a plant with certain genes removed<br/>b.   an organism with an artificially altered genome<br/>c.   a hybrid organism<br/>d.   any agricultural organism produced by breeding or biotechnology<br/><b>6. </b>What is the role of <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>in the production of transgenic plants?<br/>a.

Evolution is the process through which the characteristics of species change and through which new species arise.<br/>The theory of evolution is the unifying theory of biology, meaning it is the framework within which biologists ask questions about the living world. Its power is that it provides direction for predictions about living things that are borne out in experiment after experiment.

That species change had been suggested and debated well before Darwin. The view that species were static and unchanging was grounded in the writings of Plato, yet there were also ancient Greeks that expressed evolutionary ideas.<br/>In the eighteenth century, ideas about the evolution of animals were reintroduced by the naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and even by Charles Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin. During this time, it was also accepted that there were extinct species. At the same time, James Hutton, the Scottish naturalist, proposed that geological change occurred gradually by the accumulation of small changes from processes (over long periods of time) just like those happening today. This contrasted with the predominant view that the geology of the planet was a consequence of catastrophic events occurring during a relatively brief past. Hutton’s view was later popularized by the geologist Charles Lyell in the nineteenth century. Lyell became a friend to Darwin and his ideas were very influential on Darwin’s thinking. Lyell argued that the greater age of Earth gave more time for gradual change in species, and the process provided an analogy for gradual change in species.<br/>In the early nineteenth century, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a book that detailed a mechanism for evolutionary change that is now referred to as <b>inheritance of acquired characteristics</b>. In Lamarck’s theory, modifications in an individual caused by its environment, or the use or disuse of a structure during its lifetime, could be inherited by its offspring and, thus, bring about change in a species. While this mechanism for evolutionary change as described by Lamarck was discredited, Lamarck’s ideas were an important influence on evolutionary thought. The inscription on the statue of Lamarck that stands at the gates of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris describes him as the “founder of the doctrine of evolution.”</p><p class="s24">Charles Darwin and Natural Selection</p><p>The actual mechanism for evolution was independently conceived of and described by two naturalists, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace, in the mid-nineteenth century. Importantly, each spent time exploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the world on <i>H.M.S. Beagle</i>, visiting South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. Wallace traveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago from 1854 to 1862. Darwin’s journey, like Wallace’s later journeys in the Malay Archipelago, included stops at several island chains, the last being the Galápagos Islands (west of Ecuador). On these islands, Darwin observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences. For example, the ground finches inhabiting the Galápagos Islands comprised several species that each had a unique beak shape (<span class="s32">Figure 11.2</span>). He observed both that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the mainland of South America and that the group of species in the Galápagos formed a graded series of beak sizes and shapes, with very small differences between the most similar. Darwin imagined that the island species might be all species modified from one original mainland species. In 1860, he wrote, “Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been</p><p class="s55">[2]</p><p>taken and modified for different ends.”<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_355.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">2.

He postulated that the beak  of an ancestral species had  adapted over time to equip  the finches  to acquire different food sources. This illustration shows the beak shapes for four species of ground  finch: 1. <i>Geospiza magnirostris </i>(the  large  ground  finch), 2. <i>G. fortis </i>(the  medium ground  finch), 3. <i>G. parvula </i>(the small tree  finch), and 4. <i>Certhidea olivacea  </i>(the green-warbler finch).</p><p>Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and independently conceived a mechanism to explain how and why such changes could take place. Darwin called this mechanism natural selection. <b>Natural selection</b>, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature. First, the characteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. Second, more offspring are produced than are able to survive; in other words, resources for survival and reproduction are limited. The capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the availability of resources to support their numbers. Thus, there is a competition for those resources in each generation. Both Darwin and Wallace’s understanding of this principle came from reading an essay by the economist Thomas Malthus, who discussed this principle in relation to human populations. Third, offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited. Out of these three principles, Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics that allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to compete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation. This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called “descent with modification.”<br/>Papers by Darwin and Wallace (<span class="s32">Figure 11.3</span>) presenting the idea of natural selection were read together in 1858 before the Linnaean Society in London.

One of the best demonstrations has been in the very birds that helped to inspire the theory, the Galápagos finches. Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have studied Galápagos finch populations every year since 1976 and have provided important demonstrations of the operation of natural selection. The Grants found changes from one generation to the next in the beak shapes of the medium ground finches on the Galápagos island of Daphne Major. The medium ground finch feeds on seeds. The birds have inherited variation in the bill shape with some individuals having wide, deep bills and others having thinner bills. Large-billed birds feed more efficiently on large, hard seeds, whereas smaller billed birds feed more efficiently on small, soft seeds. During<br/>1977, a drought period altered vegetation on the island. After this period, the number of seeds declined dramatically: the decline in small, soft seeds was greater than the decline in large, hard seeds. The large-billed birds were able to survive better than the small-billed birds the following year. The year following the drought when the Grants measured beak sizes in the much-reduced population, they found that the average bill size was larger (<span class="s32">Figure 11.4</span>). This was clear evidence for natural selection (differences in survival) of bill size caused by the availability of seeds. The Grants had studied the inheritance of bill sizes and knew that the surviving large-billed birds would tend to produce offspring with larger bills, so the selection would lead to evolution of bill size. Subsequent studies by the Grants have demonstrated selection on and evolution of bill size in this species in response to changing conditions on the island. The evolution has occurred both to larger bills, as in this case, and to smaller bills when large seeds became rare.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="141" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_358.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 11.4 <span class="s30">A drought  on the Galápagos island of Daphne Major in 1977 reduced the number of small seeds available to finches,  causing many of the small-beaked finches  to die.

Importantly, these differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, selection will not lead to change in the next generation. This is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons, such as an individual being taller because of better nutrition rather than different genes.<br/>Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main sources: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles or new genetic variation in any population. An individual that has a mutated gene might have a different trait than other individuals in the population. However, this is not always the case. A mutation can have one of three outcomes on the organisms’ appearance (or phenotype):<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes                                                                                                                                                                    253</p><p>•   A mutation may affect the phenotype of the organism in a way that gives it reduced fitness—lower likelihood  of survival, resulting in fewer offspring.<br/>•   A mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness.<br/>•   Many mutations, called neutral mutations, will have no effect on fitness.<br/>Mutations may also have a whole range of effect sizes on the fitness of the organism that expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect. Sexual reproduction and crossing over in meiosis also lead to genetic diversity: when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to produce unique genotypes and, thus, phenotypes in each of the offspring.<br/>A heritable trait that aids the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an <b>adaptation</b>. An adaptation is a “match” of the organism to the environment. Adaptation to an environment comes about when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the match of the population with its environment. The variations in finch beaks shifted from generation to generation providing adaptation to food availability.<br/>Whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the environment at the time. The same traits do not always have the same relative benefit or disadvantage because environmental conditions can change. For example, finches with large bills were benefited in one climate, while small bills were a disadvantage; in a different climate, the relationship reversed.</p><p class="s34">Patterns of Evolution</p><p>The evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function. When two species evolve in different directions from a common point, it is called <b>divergent evolution</b>. Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants, which share the same basic anatomies; however, they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments, and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators (<span class="s32">Figure 11.5</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="188" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_359.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  11.5  <span class="s30">Flowering  plants  evolved  from a common ancestor. Notice that the (a) dense blazing  star  and  (b) purple coneflower vary in appearance, yet both share a similar basic  morphology. (credit a, b: modification  of work by Cory Zanker)</span></p><p>In other cases, similar phenotypes evolve independently in distantly related species. For example, flight has evolved in both bats and insects, and they both have structures we refer to as wings, which are adaptations to flight. The wings of bats and insects, however, evolved from very different original structures. When similar structures arise through evolution independently in different species it is called <b>convergent evolution</b>. The wings of bats and insects are called <b>analogous structures</b>; they are similar in function and appearance, but do not share an origin in a common ancestor. Instead they evolved independently in the two lineages. The wings of a hummingbird and an ostrich are <b>homologous structures</b>, meaning they share similarities (despite their differences resulting from evolutionary divergence). The wings of hummingbirds and ostriches did not evolve independently in the hummingbird lineage and the ostrich lineage—they descended from a common ancestor with wings.</p><p class="s24">The Modern Synthesis</p><p>The mechanisms of inheritance, genetics, were not understood at the time Darwin and Wallace were developing their idea of natural selection. This lack of understanding was a stumbling block to comprehending many aspects of evolution. In fact, blending inheritance was the predominant (and incorrect) genetic theory of the time, which made it difficult to understand how natural selection might operate. Darwin and Wallace were unaware of the genetics work by Austrian monk Gregor Mendel, which was published in 1866, not long after publication of <i>On the Origin of Species</i>. Mendel’s work was rediscovered in the early twentieth century at which time geneticists were rapidly coming to an understanding of the basics of inheritance. Initially, the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur. But over the next few decades genetics and evolution were integrated in what became known</p><p class="s20">254                                                                                                                                                                                             Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes</p><p>as the <b>modern synthesis</b>—the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today. In sum, the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary pressures, such as natural selection, can affect a population’s genetic makeup, and, in turn, how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species. The theory also connects this gradual change of a population over time, called <b>microevolution</b>, with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters, called <b>macroevolution</b>.</p><p class="s24">Population Genetics</p><p>Recall that a gene for a particular character may have several variants, or alleles, that code for different traits associated with that character. For example, in the ABO blood type system in humans, three alleles determine the particular blood-type protein on the surface of red blood cells. Each individual in a population of diploid organisms can only carry two alleles for a particular gene, but more than two may be present in the individuals that make up the population. Mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring. In the early twentieth century, biologists began to study what happens to all the alleles in a population in a field of study known as <b>population genetics</b>.<br/>Until now, we have defined evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms, but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change. In population genetic terms, evolution is defined as a change in the frequency of an allele in a population. Using the ABO system as an example, the frequency of one of the alleles, <i>I</i><span class="s54">A</span>, is the number of copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the ABO gene in the population. For example, a study in Jordan found a frequency<br/>of <i>I</i><span class="s54">A </span>to be 26.1 percent.<span class="s55">[3] </span>The <i>I</i><span class="s54">B</span>, <i>I</i><span class="s54">0 </span>alleles made up 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the<br/>frequencies add up to 100 percent. A change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population.<br/>There are several ways the allele frequencies of a population can change. One of those ways is natural selection. If a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to have more offspring that survive and reproduce, that allele, by virtue of being inherited by those offspring, will be in greater frequency in the next generation. Since allele frequencies always add up to 100 percent, an increase in the frequency of one allele always means a corresponding decrease in one or more of the other alleles. Highly beneficial alleles may, over a very few generations, become “fixed” in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele. Similarly, detrimental alleles may be swiftly eliminated from the <b>gene pool</b>, the sum of all the alleles in a population. Part of the study of population genetics is tracking how selective forces change the allele frequencies in a population over time, which can give scientists clues regarding the selective forces that may be operating on a given population. The studies of changes in wing coloration in the peppered moth from mottled white to dark in response to soot-covered tree trunks and then back to mottled white when factories stopped producing so much soot is a classic example of studying evolution in natural populations (<span class="s32">Figure 11.6</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="160" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_360.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  11.6  <span class="s30">As the  Industrial  Revolution  caused trees to darken from soot,  darker  colored  peppered moths  were better  camouflaged than  the lighter colored  ones, which caused there  to be more  of the darker  colored  moths  in the population.</span></p><p>In  the  early  twentieth  century,  English  mathematician  Godfrey  Hardy  and  German  physician  Wilhelm  Weinberg independently provided an explanation for a somewhat counterintuitive concept. Hardy’s original explanation was in response to a misunderstanding as to why a “dominant” allele, one that masks a recessive allele, should not increase in frequency in a population until it eliminated all the other alleles. The question resulted from a common confusion about what “dominant” means, but it forced Hardy, who was not even a biologist, to point out that if there are no factors that affect an allele frequency those frequencies will remain constant from one generation to the next. This principle is now known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The theory states that a population’s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable—unless some kind of evolutionary force is acting on the population, the population would carry the same alleles in the same proportions generation after generation. Individuals would, as a whole, look essentially the same and this would<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_361.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">3.   Sahar S.

The four most important evolutionary forces, which will disrupt the equilibrium, are natural selection, mutation, <b>genetic drift</b>, and <b>migration </b>into or out of a population. A fifth factor, nonrandom mating, will also disrupt the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium but only by shifting genotype frequencies, not allele frequencies. In nonrandom mating, individuals are more likely to mate with like individuals (or unlike individuals) rather than at random. Since nonrandom mating does not change allele frequencies, it does not cause evolution directly. Natural selection has been described. Mutation creates one allele out of another one and changes an allele’s frequency by a small, but continuous amount each generation. Each allele is generated by a low, constant mutation rate that will slowly increase the allele’s frequency in a population if no other forces act on the allele. If natural selection acts against the allele, it will be removed from the population at a low rate leading to a frequency that results from a balance between selection and mutation. This is one reason that genetic diseases remain in the human population at very low frequencies. If the allele is favored by selection, it will increase in frequency. Genetic drift causes random changes in allele frequencies when populations are small. Genetic drift can often be important in evolution, as discussed in the next section. Finally, if two populations of a species have different allele frequencies, migration of individuals between them will cause frequency changes in both populations. As it happens, there is no population in which one or more of these processes are not operating, so populations are always evolving, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium will never be exactly observed. However, the Hardy-Weinberg principle gives scientists a baseline expectation for allele frequencies in a non-evolving population to which they can compare evolving populations and thereby infer what evolutionary forces might be at play. The population is evolving if the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate from the value expected from the Hardy-Weinberg principle.<br/>Darwin identified a special case of natural selection that he called sexual selection. Sexual selection affects an individual’s ability to mate and thus produce offspring, and it leads to the evolution of dramatic traits that often appear maladaptive in terms of survival but persist because they give their owners greater reproductive success. Sexual selection occurs in two ways: through male–male competition for mates and through female selection of mates. Male–male competition takes the form of conflicts between males, which are often ritualized, but may also pose significant threats to a male’s survival. Sometimes the competition is for territory, with females more likely to mate with males with higher quality territories. Female choice occurs when females choose a male based on a particular trait, such as feather colors, the performance of a mating dance, or the building of an elaborate structure. In some cases male–male competition and female choice combine in the mating process. In each of these cases, the traits selected for, such as fighting ability or feather color and length, become enhanced in the males. In general, it is thought that sexual selection can proceed to a point at which natural selection against a character’s further enhancement prevents its further evolution because it negatively impacts the male’s ability to survive. For example, colorful feathers or an elaborate display make the male more obvious to predators.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="90" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_362.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">11.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Mechanisms of Evolution</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the four basic causes of evolution: natural selection, mutation, genetic drift, and gene flow<br/>•   Explain how each evolutionary force can influence the allele frequencies of a population<br/>The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle says that allele frequencies in a population will remain constant in the absence of the four factors that could change them. Those factors are natural selection, mutation, genetic drift, and migration (gene flow). In fact, we know they are probably always affecting populations.</p><p class="s24">Natural Selection</p><p>Natural selection has already been discussed. Alleles are expressed in a phenotype. Depending on the environmental conditions, the phenotype confers an advantage or disadvantage to the individual with the phenotype relative to the other phenotypes in the population. If it is an advantage, then that individual will likely have more offspring than individuals with the other phenotypes, and this will mean that the allele behind the phenotype will have greater representation in the next generation. If conditions remain the same, those offspring, which are carrying the same allele, will also benefit. Over time, the allele will increase in frequency in the population.</p><p class="s24">Mutation</p><p>Mutation is a source of new alleles in a population. Mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of the gene. A mutation can change one allele into another, but the net effect is a change in frequency. The change in frequency resulting from mutation is small, so its effect on evolution is small unless it interacts with one of the other factors, such as selection. A mutation may produce an allele that is selected against, selected for, or selectively neutral. Harmful mutations are removed</p><p class="s20">256                                                                                                                                                                                             Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes</p><p>from the population by selection and will generally only be found in very low frequencies equal to the mutation rate. Beneficial mutations will spread through the population through selection, although that initial spread is slow. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. It should be noted that mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation in all populations—new alleles, and, therefore, new genetic variations arise through mutation.</p><p class="s24">Genetic Drift</p><p>Another way a population’s allele frequencies can change is genetic drift (<span class="s32">Figure 11.7</span>), which is simply the effect of chance. Genetic drift is most important in small populations. Drift would be completely absent in a population with infinite individuals, but, of course, no population is this large. Genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. Alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. If one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—a tenth of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. In a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population’s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare allele.<br/>Imagine a population of ten individuals, half with allele <i>A </i>and half with allele <i>a </i>(the individuals are haploid). In a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. Choose that generation randomly by flipping a coin ten times and let heads be <i>A </i>and tails be <i>a</i>. It is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each allele. There might be six of one and four of the other, or some different set of frequencies. Thus, the allele frequencies have changed and evolution has occurred. A coin will no longer work to choose the next generation (because the odds are no longer one half for each allele). The frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all <i>A </i>or all <i>a </i>are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. This could take a very long time for a large population. This simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. The effect of drift on frequencies is greater the smaller a population is. Its effect is also greater on an allele with a frequency far from one half. Drift will influence every allele, even those that are being naturally selected.</p><p class="s29">Figure  11.7  <span class="s30">Genetic drift in a population  can  lead  to the elimination  of an allele from a population  by chance. In each generation, a random set of individuals reproduces to produce the next generation.

In this situation, those individuals are unlikely to be representative of the entire population which results in the <b>founder effect</b>. The founder effect occurs when the genetic structure matches that of the new population’s founding fathers and mothers. The founder effect is believed to have been a key factor in the genetic history of the Afrikaner population of Dutch settlers in South Africa, as evidenced by mutations that are common in Afrikaners but rare in most other populations. This is likely due to a higher-than-normal proportion of the founding colonists, which were a small sample of the original population, carried these mutations. As a result, the population expresses unusually high incidences of Huntington’s disease (HD) and Fanconi anemia (FA), a genetic disorder known to cause bone marrow and congenital abnormalities, and even</p><p class="s55">[4]</p><p><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_365.jpg"/></span><br/>cancer.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_366.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/genetic_drift2" class="s25">Visit this </a>site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/genetic_drift2) <span class="p">to learn more about genetic drift and to run simulations of allele changes caused by drift.</span></p><p class="s24">Gene  Flow</p><p>Another important evolutionary force is <b>gene flow</b>, or the flow of alleles in and out of a population resulting from the migration of individuals or gametes (<span class="s32">Figure 11.9</span>).

Looking at every level of organization in living systems, biologists see the signature of past and present evolution. Darwin dedicated a large portion of his book, <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, identifying patterns in nature that were consistent with evolution and since Darwin our understanding has become clearer and broader.</p><p class="s24">Fossils</p><p>Fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those found today; fossils show a progression of evolution. Scientists determine the age of fossils and categorize them all over the world to determine when the organisms lived relative to each other. The resulting fossil record tells the story of the past, and shows the evolution of form over millions of years (<span class="s32">Figure 11.10</span>). For example, highly detailed fossil records have been recovered for sequences of species in the evolution of whales and modern horses. The fossil record of horses in North America is especially rich and many contain transition fossils: those showing intermediate anatomy between earlier and later forms. The fossil record extends back to a dog-like ancestor some 55 million years ago that gave rise to the first horse-like species 55 to 42 million years ago in the genus <i>Eohippus</i>. The series of fossils tracks the change in anatomy resulting from a gradual drying trend that changed the landscape from a forested one to a prairie. Successive fossils show the evolution of teeth shapes and foot and leg anatomy to a grazing habit, with adaptations for escaping predators, for example in species of <i>Mesohippus </i>found from<br/>40 to 30 million years ago. Later species showed gains in size, such as those of <i>Hipparion</i>, which existed from about 23 to<br/>2 million years ago. The fossil record shows several adaptive radiations in the horse lineage, which is now much reduced to only one genus, <i>Equus</i>, with several species.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes                                                                                                                                                                    259</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="152" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_370.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  11.10  <span class="s30">This illustration  shows an  artist’s renderings  of these species derived  from fossils  of the  evolutionary history  of the  horse and  its ancestors.

For example, the bones in the appendages of a human, dog, bird, and whale all share the same overall construction (<span class="s32">Figure</span><br/><span class="s32">11.11</span>). That similarity results from their origin in the appendages of a common ancestor. Over time, evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species, but they have maintained the same overall layout, evidence of descent from a common ancestor. Scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures. Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all, and appear to be residual parts from a past ancestor. For example, some snakes have pelvic bones despite having no legs because they descended from reptiles that did have legs. These unused structures without function are called <b>vestigial structures</b>. Other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds (which may have other functions), leaves on some cacti, traces of pelvic bones in whales, and the sightless eyes of cave animals.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="228" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_371.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_372.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 11.11  <span class="s30">The similar construction of these appendages indicates that these organisms share a common ancestor.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_373.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bone_structure2" class="s25">Click through the activities at this </a>interactive site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bone_structure2) <span class="p">to guess which bone structures are homologous and which are analogous, and to see examples of all kinds of evolutionary adaptations that illustrate these concepts.</span></p><p class="s20">260                                                                                                                                                                                             Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes</p><p>Another evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments. For example, species of unrelated animals, such as the arctic fox and ptarmigan (a bird), living in the arctic region have temporary white coverings during winter to blend with the snow and ice (<span class="s32">Figure 11.12</span>). The similarity occurs not because of common ancestry, indeed one covering is of fur and the other of feathers, but because of similar selection pressures—the benefits of not being seen by predators.<br/><span><IMG width="424" height="265" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_374.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  11.12  <span class="s30">The  white  winter  coat  of (a)  the  arctic  fox and  (b) the  ptarmigan’s plumage are  adaptations to their environments.

Structures that are absent in some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear by the time the adult or juvenile form is reached. For example, all vertebrate embryos, including humans, exhibit gill slits at some point in their early development. These disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups, but are maintained in adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some amphibians. Great ape embryos, including humans, have a tail structure during their development that is lost by the time of birth. The reason embryos of unrelated species are often similar is that mutational changes that affect the organism during embryonic development can cause amplified differences in the adult, even while the embryonic similarities are preserved.</p><p class="s24">Biogeography</p><p>The geographic distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that are best explained by evolution in conjunction with  the  movement  of  tectonic  plates  over  geological  time.  Broad  groups  that  evolved  before  the  breakup  of  the supercontinent Pangaea (about 200 million years ago) are distributed worldwide. Groups that evolved since the breakup appear uniquely in regions of the planet, for example the unique flora and fauna of northern continents that formed from the supercontinent Laurasia and of the southern continents that formed from the supercontinent Gondwana. The presence of Proteaceae in Australia, southern Africa, and South America is best explained by the plant family’s presence there prior to the southern supercontinent Gondwana breaking up (<span class="s32">Figure 11.13</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes                                                                                                                                                                    261</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="253" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_375.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 11.13  <span class="s30">The Proteacea family of plants  evolved  before  the supercontinent Gondwana broke up.

Australia has an abundance of endemic species—species found nowhere else—which is typical of islands whose isolation by expanses of water prevents migration of species to other regions. Over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that look very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland. The marsupials of Australia, the finches on the Galápagos, and many species on the Hawaiian Islands are all found nowhere else but on their island, yet display distant relationships to ancestral species on mainlands.</p><p class="s24">Molecular  Biology</p><p>Like anatomical structures, the structures of the molecules of life reflect descent with modification. Evidence of a common ancestor for all of life is reflected in the universality of DNA as the genetic material and of the near universality of the genetic code and the machinery of DNA replication and expression. Fundamental divisions in life between the three domains are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as the components of ribosomes and the structures of membranes. In general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity of their DNA sequences—exactly the pattern that would be expected from descent and diversification from a common ancestor.<br/>DNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution. For example, it is clear that the evolution of new functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events. These duplications are a kind of mutation in which an entire gene is added as an extra copy (or many copies) in the genome. These duplications allow the free modification of one copy by mutation, selection, and drift, while the second copy continues to produce a functional protein. This allows the original function for the protein to be kept, while evolutionary forces tweak the copy until it functions in a new way.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_376.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">11.4 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Speciation</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the definition of species and how species are identified as different<br/>•   Explain allopatric and sympatric speciation<br/>•   Describe adaptive radiation<br/>The biological definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actually or potentially interbreeding individuals. According to this definition, one species is distinguished from another by the possibility of matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring. There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this</p><p class="s20">262                                                                                                                                                                                             Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes</p><p>rule generally holds. In fact, the presence of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species and that the speciation process may not yet be completed.<br/>Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for <b>speciation</b>: the formation of two species from one original species. Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in <i>On the Origin of Species </i>(<span class="s32">Figure 11.14</span><b>a</b>). For speciation to occur, two new populations must be formed from one original population, and they must evolve in such a way that it becomes impossible for individuals from the two new populations to interbreed. Biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories. <b>Allopatric speciation</b>, meaning speciation in “other homelands,” involves a geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution. <b>Sympatric speciation</b>, meaning speciation in the “same homeland,” involves speciation occurring within a parent species while remaining in one location.<br/>Biologists think of speciation events as the splitting of one ancestral species into two descendant species. There is no reason why there might not be more than two species formed at one time except that it is less likely and such multiple events can also be conceptualized as single splits occurring close in time.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="237" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_377.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  11.14  </span>The  only illustration  in Darwin’s  <i>On the  Origin of Species </i>is (a) a diagram showing  speciation events leading  to biological diversity.

Gene flow, the movement of alleles across the range of the species, is relatively free because individuals can move and then mate with individuals in their new location. Thus, the frequency of an allele at one end of a distribution will be similar to the frequency of the allele at the other end. When populations become geographically discontinuous that free-flow of alleles is prevented. When that separation lasts for a period of time, the two populations are able to evolve along different trajectories. Thus, their allele frequencies at numerous genetic loci gradually become more and more different as new alleles independently arise by mutation in each population. Typically, environmental conditions, such as climate, resources, predators, and competitors, for the two populations will differ causing natural selection to favor divergent adaptations in each group. Different histories of genetic drift, enhanced because the populations are smaller than the parent population, will also lead to divergence.<br/>Given enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will likely affect characters that influence reproduction enough that were individuals of the two populations brought together, mating would be less likely, or if a mating occurred, offspring would be non-viable or infertile. Many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation (inability to interbreed) of the two populations. These mechanisms of reproductive isolation can be divided into prezygotic mechanisms (those that operate before fertilization) and postzygotic mechanisms (those that operate after fertilization). Prezygotic mechanisms include traits that allow the individuals to find each other, such as the timing of mating, sensitivity to pheromones, or choice of mating sites. If individuals are able to encounter each other, character divergence may prevent courtship rituals from leading to a mating either because female preferences have changed or male behaviors have changed. Physiological changes may interfere with successful fertilization if mating is able to occur. Postzygotic mechanisms include genetic incompatibilities that prevent proper development of the offspring, or if the offspring live, they may be unable to produce viable gametes themselves as in the example of the mule, the infertile offspring of a female horse and a male donkey.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes                                                                                                                                                                    263</p><p>If the two isolated populations are brought back together and the hybrid offspring that formed from matings between individuals of the two populations have lower survivorship or reduced fertility, then selection will favor individuals that are able to discriminate between potential mates of their own population and the other population. This selection will enhance the reproductive isolation.<br/>Isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways: from a river forming a new branch, erosion forming a new valley, or a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to return, such as seeds floating over the ocean to an island. The nature of the geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on the biology of the organism and its potential for dispersal. If two flying insect populations took up residence in separate nearby valleys, chances are that individuals from each population would fly back and forth, continuing gene flow. However, if two rodent populations became divided by the formation of a new lake, continued gene flow would be unlikely; therefore, speciation would be more likely.<br/>Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories. If a few members of a species move to a new geographical area, this is called <b>dispersal</b>. If a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms, this is called <b>vicariance</b>.<br/>Scientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place. For example, along the west coast of the United States, two separate subspecies of spotted owls exist. The northern spotted owl has genetic and phenotypic differences from its close relative, the Mexican spotted owl, which lives in the south (<span class="s32">Figure 11.15</span>). The cause of their initial separation is not clear, but it may have been caused by the glaciers of the ice age dividing an initial population into</p><p class="s55">[5]</p><p>two.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="378" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_378.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  11.15  <span class="s30">The  northern spotted owl and  the  Mexican  spotted owl inhabit  geographically separate  locations with different  climates and  ecosystems.

This seems logical because as the distance increases, the various environmental factors would likely have less in common than locations in close proximity. Consider the two owls; in the north, the climate is cooler than in the south; the other types of organisms in each ecosystem differ, as do their behaviors and habits; also, the hunting habits and prey choices of the owls in the south vary from the northern ones. These variances can lead to evolved differences in the owls, and over time speciation will likely occur unless gene flow between the populations is restored.<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_379.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">5.

Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species, which is called <b>adaptive radiation</b>. From one point of origin, many adaptations evolve causing the species to radiate into several new ones. Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island, which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms (<span class="s32">Figure 11.16</span>). The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example of adaptive radiation. From a single species, called the founder species, numerous species have evolved, including the eight shown in <span class="s32">Figure 11.16</span>.<br/><span><IMG width="403" height="416" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_380.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  11.16  <span class="s30">The honeycreeper birds  illustrate  adaptive radiation.

Change in the genetic variation for beaks in response to natural selection based on specific food sources in each new habitat led to evolution of a different beak suited to the specific food source. The fruit and seed-eating birds have thicker, stronger beaks which are suited to break hard nuts. The nectar-eating birds have long beaks to dip into flowers to reach their nectar. The insect-eating birds have beaks like swords, appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects. Darwin’s finches are another well-studied example of adaptive radiation in an archipelago.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_382.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bird_evolution" class="s25">Click through this </a>interactive site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bird_evolution) <span class="p">to see how island birds evolved; click to see images of each species in evolutionary increments from five million years ago to today.</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes                                                                                                                                                                    265</p><p class="s24">Speciation without  Geographic Separation</p><p>Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat? A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied.<br/>One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a chromosomal error during meiosis or the formation of a hybrid individual with too many chromosomes. Polyploidy is a condition in which a cell, or organism, has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes. Scientists have identified two main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploid state. In some cases a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy (<span class="s32">Figure 11.17</span>). The prefix “auto” means self, so the term means multiple chromosomes from one’s own species. Polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into one cell instead of separating.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="150" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_383.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 11.17  <span class="s30">Autopolyploidy results when mitosis is not followed by cytokinesis.</span></p><p>For example, if a plant species with 2<i>n </i>= 6 produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid (2<i>n </i>= 6, when they should be <i>n </i>= 3), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have. These new gametes will be incompatible with the normal gametes produced by this plant species. But they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by forming offspring with 4<i>n </i>called a tetraploid. These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of this new kind and not those of the ancestral species. The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an allopolyploid. The prefix “allo” means “other” (recall from allopatric); therefore, an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine. <span class="s32">Figure 11.18 </span>illustrates one possible way an allopolyploidy can form. Notice how it takes two generations, or two reproductive acts, before the viable fertile hybrid results.<br/><span><IMG width="471" height="251" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_384.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  11.18  <span class="s30">Alloploidy results when  two species mate  to produce viable  offspring.

For example, imagine a species of fish that lived in a lake. As the population grew, competition for food also grew. Under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these fish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that was unused by the other fish. What if this new food source was found at a different depth of the lake? Over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact more with each other than the other fish; therefore they would breed together as well. Offspring of these fish would likely behave as their parents and feed and live in the same area, keeping them separate from the original population. If this group of fish continued to remain separate from the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic differences accumulated between them.<br/>This scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation. One such place is Lake Victoria in Africa, famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish. Researchers have found hundreds of sympatric speciation events in these fish, which have not only happened in great number, but also over a short period of time. <span class="s32">Figure 11.19 </span>shows this type of speciation among a cichlid fish population in Nicaragua. In this locale, two types of cichlids live in the same geographic location; however, they have come to have different morphologies that allow them to eat various food sources.<br/><span><IMG width="525" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_385.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  11.19  <span class="s30">Cichlid fish from Lake  Apoyeque, Nicaragua, show  evidence of sympatric speciation.

Nevertheless, two populations with distinct  morphologies and  diets  now exist  in the lake, and scientists believe  these populations may be in an early stage of speciation.</span></p><p>Finally,  a  well-documented  example  of  ongoing  sympatric  speciation  occurred  in  the  apple  maggot  fly,  <i>Rhagoletis pomonella, </i>which arose as an isolated population sometime after the introduction of the apple into North America. The native population of flies fed on hawthorn species and is host-specific: it only infests hawthorn trees. Importantly, it also uses the trees as a location to meet for mating. It is hypothesized that either through mutation or a behavioral mistake, flies jumped hosts and met and mated in apple trees, subsequently laying their eggs in apple fruit. The offspring matured and kept their preference for the apple trees effectively dividing the original population into two new populations separated by host species, not by geography. The host jump took place in the nineteenth century, but there are now measureable differences between the two populations of fly. It seems likely that host specificity of parasites in general is a common cause of sympatric speciation.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="90" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_386.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">11.5 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Common Misconceptions about  Evolution</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Identify common misconceptions about evolution<br/>•   Identify common criticisms of evolution<br/>Although the theory of evolution initially generated some controversy, by 20 years after the publication of <i>On the Origin of Species </i>it was almost universally accepted by biologists, particularly younger biologists.

In science, a “theory” is understood to be a concept that has been extensively tested and supported over time. We have a theory of the atom, a theory of gravity, and the theory of relativity, each of which describes what scientists understand to be facts about the world. In the same way, the theory of evolution describes facts about the living world. As such, a theory in science has survived significant efforts to discredit it by scientists, who are naturally skeptical. While theories can sometimes be overturned or revised, this does not lessen their weight but simply reflects the constantly evolving state of scientific knowledge. In contrast, a “theory” in common vernacular means a guess or suggested explanation for something. This meaning is more akin to the concept of a “hypothesis” used by scientists, which is a tentative explanation for something that is proposed to either be supported or disproved. When critics of evolution say evolution is “just a theory,” they are implying that there is little evidence supporting it and that it is still in the process of being rigorously tested. This is a mischaracterization. If this were the case, geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky would not</p><p class="s55">[6]</p><p>have said that “nothing in biology makes sense, except in the light of evolution.”</p><p class="s24">Individuals Evolve</p><p>An individual is born with the genes it has—these do not change as the individual ages. Therefore, an individual cannot evolve or adapt through natural selection. Evolution is the change in genetic composition of a population over time, specifically over generations, resulting from differential reproduction of individuals with certain alleles. Individuals do change over their lifetime, but this is called development; it involves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination with the individual’s environment. When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about the change of the average value of the characteristic in the population over time. For example, when natural selection leads to bill-size change in medium ground finches in the Galápagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are changing. If one measures the average bill size among all individuals in the population at one time, and then measures the average bill size in the population several years later after there has been a strong selective pressure, this average value may be different as a result of evolution. Although some individuals may survive from the first time to the second, those individuals will still have the same bill size. However, there may be enough new individuals with different bill sizes to change the average bill size.</p><p class="s24">Evolution Explains the Origin of Life</p><p>It is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life’s origins. Conversely, some of the theory’s critics complain that it cannot explain the origin of life. The theory does not try to explain the origin of life. The theory of evolution explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies—the origin of species. It does not shed light on the beginnings of life including the origins of the first cells, which is how life is defined. The mechanisms of the origin of life on Earth are a particularly difficult problem because it occurred a very long time ago, over a very long time, and presumably just occurred once. Importantly, biologists believe that the presence of life on Earth precludes the possibility that the events that led to life on Earth can be repeated because the intermediate stages would immediately become food for existing living things. The early stages of life included the formation of organic molecules such as carbohydrates, amino acids, or nucleotides. If these were formed from inorganic precursors today, they would simply be broken down by living things. The early stages of life also probably included more complex aggregations of molecules into enclosed structures with an internal environment, a boundary layer of some form, and the external environment. Such structures, if they were formed now, would be quickly consumed or broken down by living organisms.<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_389.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">6.

More effective reproducers would increase in frequency at the expense of inefficient reproducers. So while evolution does not explain the origin of life, it may have something to say about some of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties.</p><p class="s24">Organisms Evolve on Purpose</p><p>Statements such as “organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment,” are quite common. There are two easy misunderstandings possible with such a statement. First of all, the statement must not be understood to mean that individual organisms evolve, as was discussed above. The statement is shorthand for “a population evolves in response to a changing environment.” However, a second misunderstanding may arise by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional. A changed environment results in some individuals in the population, those with particular phenotypes, benefiting and, therefore, producing proportionately more offspring than other phenotypes. This results in change in the population if the characters are genetically determined.<br/>It is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise in response to an environmental change. For example, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will, over time, select for a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance, which is caused by a gene, did not arise by mutation because of the application of the antibiotic. The gene for resistance was already present in the gene pool of the bacteria, likely at a low frequency. The antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects for individuals that are resistant, since these would be the only ones that survived and divided. Experiments have demonstrated that mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a result of antibiotic application.<br/>In a larger sense, evolution is also not goal directed. Species do not become “better” over time; they simply track their changing environment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time. Evolution has no goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species. This kind of language is common in popular literature. Certain organisms, ourselves included, are described as the “pinnacle” of evolution, or “perfected” by evolution. What characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the environment, both of which are constantly changing in a non-directional way. What trait is fit in one environment at one time may well be fatal at some point in the future. This holds equally well for a species of insect as it does the human species.</p><p class="s24">Evolution Is Controversial among Scientists</p><p>The theory of evolution was controversial when it was first proposed in 1859, yet within 20 years virtually every working biologist had accepted evolution as the explanation for the diversity of life. The rate of acceptance was extraordinarily rapid, partly because Darwin had amassed an impressive body of evidence. The early controversies involved both scientific arguments against the theory and the arguments of religious leaders. It was the arguments of the biologists that were resolved after a short time, while the arguments of religious leaders have persisted to this day.<br/>The theory of evolution replaced the predominant theory at the time that species had all been specially created within relatively recent history. Despite the prevalence of this theory, it was becoming increasingly clear to naturalists during the nineteenth century that it could no longer explain many observations of geology and the living world. The persuasiveness of the theory of evolution to these naturalists lay in its ability to explain these phenomena, and it continues to hold extraordinary explanatory power to this day. Its continued rejection by some religious leaders results from its replacement of special creation, a tenet of their religious belief. These leaders cannot accept the replacement of special creation by a mechanistic process that excludes the actions of a deity as an explanation for the diversity of life including the origins of the human species. It should be noted, however, that most of the major denominations in the United States have statements supporting the acceptance of evidence for evolution as compatible with their theologies.<br/>The nature of the arguments against evolution by religious leaders has evolved over time. One current argument is that the theory is still controversial among biologists. This claim is simply not true. The number of working scientists who reject the theory of evolution, or question its validity and say so, is small. A Pew Research poll in 2009 found that 97 <span class="s55">[7]</span><br/>percent of the 2500 scientists polled believe species evolve.<br/>The support for the theory is reflected in signed statements<br/>from many scientific societies such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which includes working scientists as members. Many of the scientists that reject or question the theory of evolution are non-biologists, such as engineers, physicians, and chemists. There are no experimental results or research programs that contradict the theory. There are no papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals that appear to refute the theory. The latter observation might be considered a consequence of suppression of dissent, but it must be remembered that scientists are skeptics and that there is a long history of published reports that challenged scientific orthodoxy in unpopular ways. Examples include the endosymbiotic theory of eukaryotic origins, the theory of group selection, the microbial cause of stomach ulcers, the<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_390.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">7.

Research that does not meet these standards is rejected.</p><p class="s24">Other Theories Should Be Taught</p><p>A common argument from some religious leaders is that alternative theories to evolution should be taught in public schools. Critics of evolution use this strategy to create uncertainty about the validity of the theory without offering actual evidence. In fact, there are no viable alternative scientific theories to evolution. The last such theory, proposed by Lamarck in the nineteenth century, was replaced by the theory of natural selection. A single exception was a research program in the Soviet Union based on Lamarck’s theory during the early twentieth century that set that country’s agricultural research back decades. Special creation is not a viable alternative scientific theory because it is not a scientific theory, since it relies on an untestable explanation. Intelligent design, despite the claims of its proponents, is also not a scientific explanation. This is because intelligent design posits the existence of an unknown designer of living organisms and their systems. Whether the designer is unknown or supernatural, it is a cause that cannot be measured; therefore, it is not a scientific explanation. There are two reasons not to teach nonscientific theories. First, these explanations for the diversity of life lack scientific usefulness because they do not, and cannot, give rise to research programs that promote our understanding of the natural world. Experiments cannot test non-material explanations for natural phenomena. For this reason, teaching these explanations as science in public schools is not in the public interest. Second, in the United States, it is illegal to teach them as science because the U.S. Supreme Court and lower courts have ruled that the teaching of religious belief, such as special creation or intelligent design, violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits government sponsorship of a particular religion.<br/>The theory of evolution and science in general is, by definition, silent on the existence or non-existence of the spiritual world. Science is only able to study and know the material world. Individual biologists have sometimes been vocal atheists, but it is equally true that there are many deeply religious biologists. Nothing in biology precludes the existence of a god, indeed biology as a science has nothing to say about it. The individual biologist is free to reconcile her or his personal and scientific knowledge as they see fit.

The consequence is that individuals with relatively advantageous variations will be more likely to survive and have higher reproductive rates than those individuals with different traits. The advantageous traits will be passed on to offspring in greater proportion. Thus, the trait will have higher representation in the next and subsequent generations leading to genetic change in the population.<br/>The modern synthesis of evolutionary theory grew out of the reconciliation of Darwin’s, Wallace’s, and Mendel’s thoughts on evolution and heredity. Population genetics is a theoretical framework for describing evolutionary change in<br/>populations through the change in allele frequencies. Population genetics defines evolution as a change in allele frequency over generations. In the absence of evolutionary forces allele frequencies will not change in a population; this is known as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle. However, in all populations, mutation, natural selection, genetic drift, and migration act to change allele frequencies.</p><p class="s52">11.2 Mechanisms of Evolution</p><p>There are four factors that can change the allele frequencies of a population. Natural selection works by selecting for alleles that confer beneficial traits or behaviors, while selecting against those for deleterious qualities. Mutations introduce new alleles into a population. Genetic drift stems from the chance occurrence that some individuals have more offspring than others and results in changes in allele frequencies that are random in direction. When individuals leave or join the population, allele frequencies can change as a result of gene flow.</p><p class="s52">11.3 Evidence of Evolution</p><p>The evidence for evolution is found at all levels of organization in living things and in the extinct species we know about through fossils. Fossils provide evidence for the evolutionary change through now extinct forms that led to modern species. For example, there is a rich fossil record that shows the evolutionary transitions from horse ancestors to modern horses that document intermediate forms and a gradual adaptation o changing ecosystems. The anatomy of species and the embryological development of that anatomy reveal common structures in divergent lineages that have been modified over time by evolution. The geographical distribution of living species reflects the origins of species in particular geographic locations and the history of continental movements. The structures of molecules, like anatomical structures, reflect the relationships of living species and match patterns of similarity expected from descent with modification.</p><p class="s52">11.4 Speciation</p><p>Speciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic separation (allopatric speciation) and through mechanisms that occur within a shared habitat (sympatric speciation). Both pathways force reproductive isolation between populations. Sympatric speciation can occur through errors in meiosis that form gametes with extra chromosomes, called polyploidy. Autopolyploidy occurs within a single species, whereas allopolyploidy occurs because of a mating between closely related species. Once the populations are isolated, evolutionary divergence can take place leading to the evolution of reproductive isolating traits that prevent interbreeding should the two populations come together again. The reduced viability of hybrid offspring after a period of isolation is expected to select for stronger inherent isolating mechanisms.</p><p class="s52">11.5 Common Misconceptions about  Evolution</p><p>The theory of evolution is a difficult concept and misconceptions abound. The factual nature of evolution is often challenged by wrongly associating the scientific meaning of a theory with the vernacular meaning. Evolution is sometimes mistakenly interpreted to mean that individuals evolve, when in fact only populations can evolve as their gene frequencies change over time. Evolution is often assumed to explain the origin of life, which it does not speak to. It is often spoken in goal-directed terms by which organisms change through intention, and selection operates on mutations present in a population that have not arisen in response to a particular environmental stress. Evolution is often characterized as being controversial among scientists; however, it is accepted by the vast majority of working scientists. Critics of evolution often argue that alternative theories to evolution should be taught in public schools; however, there are no viable alternative scientific theories to evolution. The alternative religious beliefs should not be taught as science because it cannot be proven, and in the United States it is unconstitutional. Science is silent on the question of the existence of a god while scientists are able to reconcile religious belief and scientific knowledge.</p><p class="s20">272                                                                                                                                                                                             Chapter 11 | Evolution and Its Processes</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 11.7 </span><span class="p">Do you think genetic drift would happen more quickly on an island or on the mainland?</span></p><p class="s24">REVIEW QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">2. <span class="p">Which scientific concept did Charles Darwin and</span></p><p>Alfred Wallace independently discover?<br/>a.   mutation<br/>b.   natural selection<br/>c.   overbreeding<br/>d.   sexual reproduction</p><p class="s27">3. <span class="p">Which of the following situations will lead to natural selection?</span></p><p>a.

The pathway can be traced from the origin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by starting with a single species and tracing backward to any branch point, the organisms related to it by various degrees of closeness can be identified.<br/>A <b>phylogeny </b>is the evolutionary history and the relationships among a species or group of species. The study of organisms with the purpose of deriving their relationships is called <b>systematics</b>.<br/>Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time, and together they contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the “tree of life.” Information gathered may include data collected from fossils, from studying morphology, from the structure of body parts, or from molecular structure, such as the sequence of amino acids in proteins or DNA nucleotides. By considering the trees generated by different sets of data scientists can put together the phylogeny of a species.<br/>Scientists continue to discover new species of life on Earth as well as new character information, thus trees change as new data arrive.</p><p class="s24">The Levels of Classification</p><p class="s27">Taxonomy <span class="p">(which literally means “arrangement law”) is the science of naming and grouping species to construct an internationally shared classification system. The taxonomic classification system (also called the Linnaean system after its inventor, Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist) uses a hierarchical model. A hierarchical system has levels and each group at one of the levels includes groups at the next lowest level, so that at the lowest level each member belongs to a series of nested groups. An analogy is the nested series of directories on the main disk drive of a computer. For example, in the most inclusive grouping, scientists divide organisms into three </span>domains<span class="p">: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Within each domain is a second level called a </span>kingdom<span class="p">. Each domain contains several kingdoms. Within kingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: </span>phylum<span class="p">, </span>class<span class="p">, </span>order<span class="p">, </span>family<span class="p">, </span>genus<span class="p">, and </span>species<span class="p">.</span></p><p>As an example, the classification levels for the domestic dog are shown in <span class="s32">Figure 12.3</span>. The group at each level is called a <b>taxon </b>(plural: taxa). In other words, for the dog, Carnivora is the taxon at the order level, Canidae is the taxon at the family level, and so forth. Organisms also have a common name that people typically use, such as domestic dog, or wolf. Each taxon name is capitalized except for species, and the genus and species names are italicized. Scientists refer to an organism by its genus and species names together, commonly called a scientific name, or Latin name. This two-name system is called <b>binomial nomenclature</b>. The scientific name of the wolf is therefore <i>Canis lupus</i>.

Notice how within the domain we find the dog grouped with the widest diversity of organisms. These include plants and other organisms not pictured, such as fungi and protists. At each sublevel, the organisms become more similar because they are more closely related. Before Darwin’s theory of evolution was developed, naturalists sometimes classified organisms using arbitrary similarities, but since the theory of evolution was proposed in the 19<span class="s54">th </span>century, biologists work to make the classification system reflect evolutionary relationships. This means that all of the members of a taxon should have a common ancestor and be more closely related to each other than to members of other taxa.<br/>Recent genetic analysis and other advancements have found that some earlier taxonomic classifications do not reflect actual evolutionary relationships, and therefore, changes and updates must be made as new discoveries take place. One dramatic and recent example was the breaking apart of prokaryotic species, which until the 1970s were all classified as bacteria. Their division into Archaea and Bacteria came about after the recognition that their large genetic differences warranted their separation into two of three fundamental branches of life.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="718" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_395.png"/></span></p><p class="s20">278                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 12 | Diversity of Life</p><p class="s29">Figure  12.3  <span class="s30">At each sublevel in the  taxonomic classification system, organisms become  more  similar.

A <b>phylogenetic tree </b>is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. The hierarchical classification of groups nested within more inclusive groups is reflected in diagrams. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past because one cannot go back through time to confirm the proposed relationships.<br/>Unlike with a taxonomic classification, a phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history, as shown in <span class="s32">Figure 12.4</span>. Shared characteristics are used to construct phylogenetic trees. The point where a split occurs in a tree, called a <b>branch point</b>, represents where a single lineage evolved into distinct new ones. Many phylogenetic trees have a single branch point at the base representing a common ancestor of all the branches in the tree. Scientists call such trees <b>rooted</b>, which means there is a single ancestral taxon at the base of a phylogenetic tree to which all organisms represented in the diagram descend from. When two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are called <b>sister taxa</b>, for example the two species of orangutans. A branch point with more than two groups illustrates a situation for which scientists have not definitively determined relationships. An example is illustrated by the three branches leading to the gorilla subspecies; their exact relationships are not yet understood. It is important to note that sister taxa share an ancestor, which does not mean that one taxon evolved from the other. The branch point, or split, represents a common ancestor that existed in the past, but that no longer exists. Humans did not evolve from chimpanzees (nor did chimpanzees evolve from humans) although they are our closest living relatives. Both humans and chimpanzees evolved from a common ancestor that lived, scientists believe, six million years ago and looked different from both modern chimpanzees and modern humans.<br/><span><IMG width="525" height="151" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_398.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 12.4 <span class="s30">A phylogenetic tree is rooted  and shows how different organisms, in this case the species and subspecies of living apes, evolved  from a common ancestor.</span></p><p>The branch points and the branches in phylogenetic tree structure also imply evolutionary change. Sometimes the significant character changes are identified on a branch or branch point. For example, in <span class="s32">Figure 12.5</span>, the branch point that gives rise to the mammal and reptile lineage from the frog lineage shows the origin of the amniotic egg character. Also the branch point that gives rise to organisms with legs is indicated at the common ancestor of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and jawed fishes.</p><p class="s20">280                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 12 | Diversity of Life</p><p><span><IMG width="381" height="228" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_399.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_400.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  12.5  <span class="s30">This phylogenetic tree  is rooted  by an  organism that  lacked  a vertebral column.

If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly different surroundings or after the evolution of a major new adaptation, they may look quite different from each other, even more so than other groups that are not as closely related. For example, the phylogenetic tree in <span class="s32">Figure 12.5 </span>shows that lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs, whereas salamanders (within the frog lineage) do not; yet on the surface, lizards and salamanders appear more similar than the lizards and rabbits.<br/>Another aspect of phylogenetic trees is that, unless otherwise indicated, the branches do not show length of time, they show only the order in time of evolutionary events. In other words, a long branch does not necessarily mean more time passed, nor does a short branch mean less time passed— unless specified on the diagram. For example, in <span class="s32">Figure 12.5</span>, the tree does not indicate how much time passed between the evolution of amniotic eggs and hair. What the tree does show is the order in which things took place. Again using <span class="s32">Figure 12.5</span>, the tree shows that the oldest trait is the vertebral column, followed by hinged jaws, and so forth. Remember that any phylogenetic tree is a part of the greater whole, and similar to a real tree, it does not grow in only one direction after a new branch develops. So, for the organisms in <span class="s32">Figure 12.5</span>, just because a vertebral column evolved does not mean that invertebrate evolution ceased, it only means that a new branch formed. Also, groups that are not closely related, but evolve under similar conditions, may appear more similar to each other than to a close relative.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="90" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_402.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">12.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Determining Evolutionary Relationships</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Compare homologous and analogous traits<br/>•   Discuss the purpose of cladistics<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 12 | Diversity of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                  281</p><p>Scientists collect information that allows them to make evolutionary connections between organisms.

An example is the streamlined body shapes, the shapes of fins and appendages, and the shape of the tails in fishes and whales, which are mammals. These structures bear superficial similarity because they are adaptations to moving and maneuvering in the same environment—water. When a characteristic that is similar occurs by adaptive convergence (convergent evolution), and not because of a close evolutionary relationship, it is called an <b>analogous structure</b>. In another example, insects use wings to fly like bats and birds. We call them both wings because they perform the same function and have a superficially similar form, but the embryonic origin of the two wings is completely different. The difference in the development, or embryogenesis, of the wings in each case is a signal that insects and bats or birds do not share a common ancestor that had a wing. The wing structures, shown in <span class="s32">Figure 12.8 </span>evolved independently in the two lineages.<br/>Similar traits can be either homologous or analogous. Homologous traits share an evolutionary path that led to the development of that trait, and analogous traits do not. Scientists must determine which type of similarity a feature exhibits to decipher the phylogeny of the organisms being studied.</p><p class="s20">284                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 12 | Diversity of Life</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="417" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_406.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_407.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  12.8  <span class="s30">The wing of a honey  bee  is similar in shape to a bird wing and  a bat wing and  serves the same function (flight).

New analysis of molecular characters not only confirms many earlier classifications, but also uncovers previously made errors. Molecular characters can include differences in the amino-acid sequence of a protein, differences in the individual nucleotide sequence of a gene, or differences in the arrangements of genes. Phylogenies based on molecular characters assume that the more similar the sequences are in two organisms, the more closely related they are. Different genes change evolutionarily at different rates and this affects the level at which they are useful at identifying relationships. Rapidly evolving sequences are useful for determining the relationships among closely related species. More slowly evolving sequences are useful for determining the relationships between distantly related species. To determine the relationships between very different species such as Eukarya and Archaea, the genes used must be very ancient, slowly evolving genes that are present in both groups, such as the genes for<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 12 | Diversity of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                  285</p><p>ribosomal RNA. Comparing phylogenetic trees using different sequences and finding them similar helps to build confidence in the inferred relationships.<br/>Sometimes two segments of DNA in distantly related organisms randomly share a high percentage of bases in the same locations, causing these organisms to appear closely related when they are not.

Two of those applications include understanding <span class="s55">[3]</span><br/>the evolution  and  transmission of disease and  making decisions about  conservation efforts. A 2010  study<br/>of MRSA (methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>), an antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacterium, traced the  origin and  spread of the  strain  throughout the  past  40  years. The  study  uncovered the  timing and patterns in which the  resistant strain  moved  from its point of origin in Europe to centers of infection  and evolution  in South  America,  Asia, North America,  and  Australasia. The study  suggested that introductions of the bacteria to new populations occurred very few times,  perhaps only once,  and  then  spread from that limited number of individuals.  This  is in contrast to the  possibility  that  many  individuals  had  carried  the bacteria from one  place  to another. This result  suggests that  public health  officials should  concentrate on quickly identifying the contacts of individuals infected  with a new strain of bacteria to control its spread.<br/>A second area of usefulness for phylogenetic analysis is in conservation. Biologists  have  argued that  it is important  to protect  species throughout a  phylogenetic tree  rather  than  just those from one  branch of the  tree.  Doing this will preserve more  of the  variation  produced by evolution.  For example, conservation efforts  should  focus  on  a  single  species without  sister  species rather  than  another species that  has  a cluster  of close  sister  species that recently  evolved. If the single  evolutionarily  distinct species goes extinct a disproportionate amount of variation  from the tree  will be lost compared to one  species in the cluster  of</p><p class="s55">[4]</p><p>closely  related species. A study  published in 2007<br/>made recommendations for conservation of mammal<br/>species worldwide  based on how evolutionarily  distinct and  at risk of extinction  they are.  The study  found that  their  recommendations differed  from priorities  based on  simply  the  level  of extinction  threat  to the species. The  study  recommended protecting some threatened and  valued  large  mammals such  as the orangutans, the  giant  and  lesser pandas, and  the  African and  Asian  elephants. But they  also  found  that some much  lesser known species should  be protected based on how evolutionary distinct they are.  These include a number of rodents, bats,  shrews and hedgehogs. In addition there  are some critically endangered species that  did not rate  as very important  in evolutionary distinctiveness including  species of deer  mice and gerbils. While many criteria affect conservation decisions, preserving phylogenetic diversity provides an objective  way to protect  the full range of diversity generated by evolution.</p><p class="s24">Building Phylogenetic Trees</p><p>How do scientists construct phylogenetic trees? Presently, the most accepted method for constructing phylogenetic trees is a method called <b>cladistics</b>. This method sorts organisms into <b>clades</b>, groups of organisms that are most closely related to each other and the ancestor from which they descended. For example, in <span class="s32">Figure 12.9</span>, all of the organisms in the shaded region evolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs. Consequently, all of these organisms also have amniotic eggs and make a single clade, also called a <b>monophyletic group</b>. Clades must include the ancestral species and all of the descendants from a branch point.<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_410.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">2.   <i>Background on comparative genomic analysis</i>.

The important factor is that all of the organisms in the clade or monophyletic group stem from a single point on the tree. This can be remembered because monophyletic breaks down into “mono,” meaning one, and “phyletic,” meaning evolutionary relationship.</p><p class="s34">Shared Characteristics</p><p>Cladistics rests on three assumptions. The first is that living things are related by descent from a common ancestor, which is a general assumption of evolution. The second is that speciation occurs by splits of one species into two, never more than two at a time, and essentially at one point in time. This is somewhat controversial, but is acceptable to most biologists as a simplification. The third assumption is that traits change enough over time to be considered to be in a different state .It is also assumed that one can identify the actual direction of change for a state. In other words, we assume that an amniotic egg is a later character state than non-amniotic eggs. This is called the polarity of the character change. We know this by reference to a group outside the clade: for example, insects have non-amniotic eggs; therefore, this is the older or ancestral character state. Cladistics compares ingroups and outgroups. An ingroup (lizard, rabbit and human in our example) is the group of taxa being analyzed. An outgroup (lancelet, lamprey and fish in our example) is a species or group of species that diverged before the lineage containing the group(s) of interest. By comparing ingroup members to each other and to the outgroup members, we can determine which characteristics are evolutionary modifications determining the branch points of the ingroup’s phylogeny.<br/>If a characteristic is found in all of the members of a group, it is a <b>shared ancestral character </b>because there has been no change in the trait during the descent of each of the members of the clade. Although these traits appear interesting because they unify the clade, in cladistics they are considered not helpful when we are trying to determine the relationships of the members of the clade because every member is the same. In contrast, consider the amniotic egg characteristic of <span class="s32">Figure</span><br/><span class="s32">12.9</span>. Only some of the organisms have this trait, and to those that do, it is called a <b>shared derived character </b>because this trait changed at some point during descent. This character does tell us about the relationships among the members of the clade; it tells us that lizards, rabbits, and humans group more closely together than any of these organisms do with fish, lampreys, and lancelets.<br/>A sometimes confusing aspect of “ancestral” and “derived” characters is that these terms are relative. The same trait could be either ancestral or derived depending on the diagram being used and the organisms being compared. Scientists find these terms useful when distinguishing between clades during the building of phylogenetic trees, but it is important to remember that their meaning depends on context.</p><p class="s34">Choosing the Right  Relationships</p><p>Constructing a phylogenetic tree, or cladogram, from the character data is a monumental task that is usually left up to a computer. The computer draws a tree such that all of the clades share the same list of derived characters. But there are other decisions to be made, for example, what if a species presence in a clade is supported by all of the shared derived characters for that clade except one? One conclusion is that the trait evolved in the ancestor, but then changed back in that one species. Also a character state that appears in two clades must be assumed to have evolved independently in those clades.

This means that the “best” tree is the one with the fewest number of character reversals, the fewest number of independent character changes, and the fewest number of character changes throughout the tree. Computer programs search through all of the possible trees to find the small number of trees with the simplest evolutionary pathways. Starting with all of the homologous traits in a group of organisms, scientists can determine the order of evolutionary events of which those traits occurred that is the most obvious and simple.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_413.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/parsimony2" class="s25">Practice Parsimony: Go to </a>this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/parsimony2) <span class="p">to learn how maximum parsimony is used to create phylogenetic trees (be sure to continue to the second page).</span></p><p>These tools and concepts are only a few of the strategies scientists use to tackle the task of revealing the evolutionary history of life on Earth.

Using morphologic and molecular data, scientists work to identify homologous characteristics and genes.

After homologous information is identified, scientists use cladistics to organize these events as a means to determine an evolutionary timeline. Scientists apply the concept of maximum parsimony, which states that the likeliest order of events is probably the simplest shortest path. For evolutionary events, this would be the path with the least number of major divergences that correlate with the evidence.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 12.3 </span><span class="p">In what levels are cats and dogs considered to be part of the same group?</span></p><p class="s27">2. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 12.8 </span><span class="p">Which animals in this figure belong to a clade that includes animals with hair?

In the late twentieth century, the pioneering work of Carl Woese and others compared nucleotide sequences of small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA), which resulted in a dramatically different way to group organisms on Earth. Based on differences in the structure of cell membranes and in rRNA, Woese and his colleagues proposed that all life on Earth evolved along three lineages, called domains. The three domains are called Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.</p><p class="s20">292                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p>Two of the three domains—Bacteria and Archaea—are prokaryotic, meaning that they lack both a nucleus and true membrane-bound organelles. However, they are now considered, on the basis of membrane structure and rRNA, to be as different from each other as they are from the third domain, the Eukarya. Prokaryotes were the first inhabitants on Earth, perhaps appearing approximately 3.9 billion years ago. Today they are ubiquitous—inhabiting the harshest environments on the planet, from boiling hot springs to permanently frozen environments in Antarctica, as well as more benign environments such as compost heaps, soils, ocean waters, and the guts of animals (including humans). The Eukarya include the familiar kingdoms of animals, plants, and fungi. They also include a diverse group of kingdoms formerly grouped together as protists.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="134" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_416.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">13.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Prokaryotic Diversity</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the evolutionary history of prokaryotes<br/>•   Describe the basic structure of a typical prokaryote<br/>•   Identify bacterial diseases that caused historically important plagues and epidemics<br/>•   Describe the uses of prokaryotes in food processing and bioremediation<br/>Prokaryotes are present everywhere. They cover every imaginable surface where there is sufficient moisture, and they live on and inside of other living things. There are more prokaryotes inside and on the exterior of the human body than there are human cells in the body. Some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable for most other living things. Prokaryotes recycle nutrients—essential substances (such as carbon and nitrogen)—and they drive the evolution of new ecosystems, some of which are natural while others are man-made. Prokaryotes have been on Earth since long before multicellular life appeared.</p><p class="s24">Prokaryotic Diversity</p><p>The advent of DNA sequencing provided immense insight into the relationships and origins of prokaryotes that were not possible using traditional methods of classification. A major insight identified two groups of prokaryotes that were found to be as different from each other as they were from eukaryotes. This recognition of prokaryotic diversity forced a new understanding of the classification of all life and brought us closer to understanding the fundamental relationships of all living things, including ourselves.</p><p class="s34">Early Life on Earth</p><p>When and where did life begin? What were the conditions on Earth when life began? Prokaryotes were the first forms of life on Earth, and they existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. Earth is about 4.54 billion years old. This estimate is based on evidence from the dating of meteorite material, since surface rocks on Earth are not as old as Earth itself. Most rocks available on Earth have undergone geological changes that make them younger than Earth itself. Some meteorites are made of the original material in the solar disk that formed the objects of the solar system, and they have not been altered by the processes that altered rocks on Earth. Thus, the age of meteorites is a good indicator of the age of the formation of Earth. The original estimate of 4.54 billion years was obtained by Clare Patterson in 1956. His meticulous work has since been corroborated by ages determined from other sources, all of which point to an Earth age of about 4.54 billion years.<br/>Early Earth had a very different atmosphere than it does today. Evidence indicates that during the first 2 billion years of Earth’s existence, the atmosphere was <b>anoxic</b>, meaning that there was no oxygen. Therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygen— <b>anaerobic </b>organisms—were able to live. Organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called <b>phototrophs</b>. Phototrophic organisms that required an organic source of carbon appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth. Then, <b>cyanobacteria</b>, also known as blue-green algae, evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later. Cyanobacteria are able to use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon. Cyanobacteria (<span class="s32">Figure 13.2</span>) began the oxygenation of the atmosphere. The increase in oxygen concentration allowed the evolution of other life forms.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists                                                                                                                                                    293</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="241" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_417.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 13.2 <span class="s30">This hot spring in Yellowstone National Park flows toward the foreground.

The water is cooler at the edges of the stream than in the center, causing the edges to appear greener.

At this time, too, strong volcanic activity was common on Earth, so it is likely that these first organisms—the first prokaryotes—were adapted to very high temperatures. These are not the typical temperate environments in which most life flourishes today; thus, we can conclude that the first organisms that appeared on Earth likely were able to withstand harsh conditions.<br/>Microbial mats may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth, and there is fossil evidence of their presence, starting about<br/>3.5 billion years ago. A <b>microbial mat </b>is a large biofilm, a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes (<span class="s32">Figure 13.3</span><b>a</b>), including mostly bacteria, but also archaea. Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick, and they typically grow on moist surfaces. Their various types of prokaryotes carry out different metabolic pathways, and for this reason, they reflect various colors. Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a gummy-like substance that they secrete.<br/>The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from hydrothermal vents. A <b>hydrothermal vent </b>is a fissure in Earth’s surface that releases geothermally heated water. With the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source—sunlight—whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for food.<br/><span><IMG width="480" height="185" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_418.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  13.3  <span class="s30">(a) This microbial mat grows  over a hydrothermal vent in the Pacific Ocean.

A <b>stromatolite </b>is a sedimentary structure formed when minerals are precipitated from water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat (<span class="s32">Figure 13.3</span><b>b</b>). Stromatolites form layered rocks made of carbonate or silicate. Although most stromatolites are artifacts from the past, there are places on Earth where stromatolites are still forming. For example, living stromatolites have been found in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in San Diego County, California.</p><p class="s20">294                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_419.jpg"/></span><br/>Some prokaryotes are able to thrive and grow under conditions that would kill a plant or animal. Bacteria and archaea that grow under extreme conditions are called <b>extremophiles</b>, meaning “lovers of extremes.” Extremophiles have been found in extreme environments of all kinds, including the depths of the oceans, hot springs, the Arctic and the Antarctic, very dry places, deep inside Earth, harsh chemical environments, and high radiation environments. Extremophiles give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of the discovery of new therapeutic drugs or industrial applications. They have also opened up the possibility of finding life in other places in the solar system, which have harsher environments than those typically found on Earth. Many of these extremophiles cannot survive in moderate environments.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_420.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/extremophiles" class="s25">Watch a </a>video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/extremophiles) <span class="p">showing the Director of the Planetary Science Division of NASA discussing the implications that the existence extremophiles on Earth have on the possibility of finding life on other planets in our solar system, such as Mars.</span></p><p class="s24">Biofilms</p><p>Until a couple of decades ago, microbiologists thought of prokaryotes as isolated entities living apart. This model, however, does not reflect the true ecology of prokaryotes, most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact. A <b>biofilm </b>is a microbial community held together in a gummy-textured matrix, consisting primarily of polysaccharides secreted by the organisms, together with some proteins and nucleic acids. Biofilms grow attached to surfaces. Some of the best-studied biofilms are composed of prokaryotes, although fungal biofilms have also been described.<br/>Biofilms are present almost everywhere. They cause the clogging of pipes and readily colonize surfaces in industrial settings. They have played roles in recent, large-scale outbreaks of bacterial contamination of food. Biofilms also colonize household surfaces, such as kitchen counters, cutting boards, sinks, and toilets.<br/>Interactions  among  the  organisms  that  populate  a  biofilm,  together  with  their  protective  environment,  make  these communities more robust than are free-living, or planktonic, prokaryotes. Overall, biofilms are very difficult to destroy, because they are resistant to many of the common forms of sterilization.</p><p class="s24">Characteristics of Prokaryotes</p><p>There are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. However, all cells have four common structures: a plasma membrane that functions as a barrier for the cell and separates the cell from its environment; cytoplasm, a jelly- like substance inside the cell; genetic material (DNA and RNA); and ribosomes, where protein synthesis takes place. Prokaryotes come in various shapes, but many fall into three categories: cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod-shaped), and spirilla (spiral-shaped) (<span class="s32">Figure 13.4</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists                                                                                                                                                    295</p><p><span><IMG width="527" height="197" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_421.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  13.4 <span class="s30">Many prokaryotes fall into three  basic  categories based on their shape: (a) cocci, or spherical; (b) bacilli, or rod-shaped; and  (c) spirilla, or spiral-shaped.

Therefore, they do not have a nucleus but instead have a single chromosome—a piece of circular DNA located in an area of the cell called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall lying outside the plasma membrane. The composition of the cell wall differs significantly between the domains Bacteria and Archaea (and their cell walls also differ from the eukaryotic cell walls found in plants and fungi.) The cell wall functions as a protective layer and is responsible for the organism’s shape. Some other structures are present in some prokaryotic species, but not in others. For example, the <b>capsule </b>found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces and protects it from dehydration. Some species may also have flagella (singular, flagellum) used for locomotion, and pili (singular, pilus) used for attachment to surfaces and to other bacteria for conjugation. Plasmids, which consist of small, circular pieces of DNA outside of the main chromosome, are also present in many species of bacteria.<br/><span><IMG width="298" height="209" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_422.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 13.5 <span class="s30">The features of a typical bacterium cell are shown.</span></p><p>Both Bacteria and Archaea are types of prokaryotic cells. They differ in the lipid composition of their cell membranes and in the characteristics of their cell walls. Both types of prokaryotes have the same basic structures, but these are built from different chemical components that are evidence of an ancient separation of their lineages. The archaeal plasma membrane is chemically different from the bacterial membrane; some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of phosopholipid bilayers.</p><p class="s34">The Cell Wall</p><p>The cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some prokaryotic cells and gives them shape and rigidity. It is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis (bursting caused by increasing volume). The chemical compositions of the cell walls vary between Archaea and Bacteria, as well as between bacterial species. Bacterial cell walls contain <b>peptidoglycan</b>, composed of polysaccharide chains cross-linked to peptides. Bacteria are divided into two major groups: <b>Gram-positive </b>and <b>Gram-negative</b>, based on their reaction to a procedure called Gram staining. The different bacterial responses to the staining procedure are caused by cell wall structure. Gram-positive organisms have a thick wall consisting</p><p class="s20">296                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p>of many layers of peptidoglycan.

There are four different types of archaeal cell walls. One type is composed of <b>pseudopeptidoglycan</b>. The other three types of cell walls contain polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and surface-layer proteins known as S-layers.</p><p class="s24">Reproduction</p><p>Reproduction in prokaryotes is primarily asexual and takes place by binary fission. Recall that the DNA of a prokaryote exists usually as a single, circular chromosome. Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis. Rather, the chromosome loop is replicated, and the two resulting copies attached to the plasma membrane move apart as the cell grows in a process called binary fission. The prokaryote, now enlarged, is pinched inward at its equator, and the two resulting cells, which are clones, separate. Binary fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic recombination, but prokaryotes can alter their genetic makeup in three ways.<br/>In a process called <b>transformation</b>, the cell takes in DNA found in its environment that is shed by other prokaryotes, alive or dead. A <b>pathogen </b>is an organism that causes a disease. If a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA in its own chromosome, it too may become pathogenic. In <b>transduction</b>, bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, move DNA from one bacterium to another. Archaea have a different set of viruses that infect them and translocate genetic material from one individual to another. During <b>conjugation</b>, DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means of a pilus that brings the organisms into contact with one another. The DNA transferred is usually a plasmid, but parts of the chromosome can also be moved.<br/>Cycles of binary fission can be very rapid, on the order of minutes for some species. This short generation time coupled with mechanisms of genetic recombination result in the rapid evolution of prokaryotes, allowing them to respond to environmental changes (such as the introduction of an antibiotic) very quickly.</p><p class="s34">How Prokaryotes Obtain Energy and Carbon</p><p>Prokaryotes are metabolically diverse organisms.

It is worth noting that all pathogenic prokaryotes are Bacteria; there are no known pathogenic Archaea in humans or any other organism. Pathogenic organisms evolved alongside humans. In the past, the true cause of these diseases was not understood, and some cultures thought that diseases were a spiritual punishment or were mistaken about material causes. Over time, people came to realize that staying apart from afflicted persons, improving sanitation, and properly disposing of the corpses and personal belongings of victims of illness reduced their own chances of getting sick.</p><p class="s24">Historical Perspective</p><p>There are records of infectious diseases as far back as 3,000 B.C. A number of significant <b>pandemics </b>caused by Bacteria have been documented over several hundred years. Some of the largest pandemics led to the decline of cities and cultures. Many were zoonoses that appeared with the domestication of animals, as in the case of tuberculosis. A zoonosis is a disease that infects animals but can be transmitted from animals to humans.<br/>Infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide. Their impact is less significant in many developed countries, but they are important determiners of mortality in developing countries. The development of antibiotics did much to lessen the mortality rates from bacterial infections, but access to antibiotics is not universal, and the overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of resistant strains of bacteria. Public sanitation efforts that dispose of sewage and provide clean drinking water have done as much or more than medical advances to prevent deaths caused by bacterial infections.<br/>In 430 B.C., the plague of Athens killed one-quarter of the Athenian troops that were fighting in the Great Peloponnesian War. The disease killed a quarter of the population of Athens in over 4 years and weakened Athens’ dominance and power. The source of the plague may have been identified recently when researchers from the University of Athens were able to analyze DNA from teeth recovered from a mass grave. The scientists identified nucleotide sequences from a pathogenic</p><p class="s55">[1]</p><p>bacterium that causes typhoid fever.<br/>From 541 to 750 A.D., an outbreak called the plague of Justinian (likely a bubonic plague) eliminated, by some estimates, one-quarter to one-half of the human population. The population in Europe declined by 50 percent during this outbreak. Bubonic plague would decimate Europe more than once.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_424.jpg"/></span><br/>One of the most devastating pandemics was the <b>Black Death </b>(1346 to 1361), which is believed to have been another outbreak of bubonic plague caused by the bacterium <i>Yersinia pestis</i>. This bacterium is carried by fleas living on black rats. The Black Death reduced the world’s population from an estimated 450 million to about 350 to 375 million. Bubonic plague struck London hard again in the mid-1600s. There are still approximately 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague globally each year. Although contracting bubonic plague before antibiotics meant almost certain death, the bacterium responds to several types of modern antibiotics, and mortality rates from plague are now very low.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_425.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/black_death2" class="s25">Watch a </a>video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/black_death2) <span class="p">on the modern understanding of the Black Death (bubonic plague) in Europe during the fourteenth century.</span></p><p>Over the centuries, Europeans developed resistance to many infectious diseases.

Today’s news and media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis. Are antibiotics that were used to treat bacterial infections easily treatable in the past becoming obsolete? Are there new “superbugs”—bacteria that have evolved to become more resistant to our arsenal of antibiotics? Is this the beginning of the end of antibiotics? All of these questions challenge the healthcare community.<br/>One of the main reasons for resistant bacteria is the overuse and incorrect use of antibiotics, such as not completing a full course of prescribed antibiotics. The incorrect use of an antibiotic results in the natural selection of resistant forms of bacteria. The antibiotic kills most of the infecting bacteria, and therefore only the resistant forms remain. These resistant forms reproduce, resulting in an increase in the proportion of resistant forms over non-resistant ones.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_427.jpg"/></span><br/>Another problem is the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock. The routine use of antibiotics in animal feed promotes bacterial resistance as well. In the United States, 70 percent of the antibiotics produced are fed to animals. The antibiotics are not used to prevent disease, but to enhance production of their products.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_428.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/antibiotics2" class="s25">Watch  a  recent  </a>news  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/antibiotics2)  <span class="p">report  on  the  problem  of  routine  antibiotic administration to livestock and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</span></p><p class="s22">Staphylococcus aureus<span class="p">, often called “staph,” is a common bacterium that can live in and on the human body, which usually is easily treatable with antibiotics.

Outbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common. A <b>foodborne disease </b>(colloquially called “food poisoning”) is an illness resulting from the consumption of food contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or other parasites. Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that “76 million people get sick, more than 300,000 are hospitalized, and 5,000 Americans</p><p class="s55">[3]</p><p>die each year from foodborne illness.”<br/>The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time. In the past, it was relatively common to hear about sporadic cases of <b>botulism</b>, the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacterium <i>Clostridium botulinum</i>.  A  can,  jar,  or  package  created  a  suitable  anaerobic  environment  where  <i>Clostridium  </i>could  grow.  Proper sterilization and canning procedures have reduced the incidence of this disease.<br/>Most cases of foodborne illnesses are now linked to produce contaminated by animal waste. For example, there have been serious, produce-related outbreaks associated with raw spinach in the United States and with vegetable sprouts in Germany (<span class="s32">Figure 13.8</span>). The raw spinach outbreak in 2006 was produced by the bacterium <i>E. coli </i>strain O157:H7.

Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater. Certain toxic metals, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation. The reduction of</p><p class="s11">SeO <span class="s10">2−</span></p><p>to  <span class="s11">SeO </span><span class="s10">2−</span><br/>and to Se<span class="s54">0 </span>(metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium ions from water. Mercury is an<br/>example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation. Mercury is an active ingredient of some pesticides; it is used in industry and is also a byproduct of certain industries, such as battery production. Mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments but it is highly toxic because it accumulates in living tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These bacteria, such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, can convert Hg<span class="s54">2+ </span>to Hg<span class="s54">0</span>, which is nontoxic to humans.<br/>Probably one of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil spills. The importance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years, such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989) (<span class="s32">Figure 13.10</span>), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into the Mediterranean from a Lebanon power plant (2006,) and more recently, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (2010). To clean up these spills, bioremediation is promoted by adding inorganic nutrients that help bacteria already present in the environment to grow. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on the hydrocarbons in the oil droplet, breaking them into inorganic compounds. Some species, such as <i>Alcanivorax borkumensis</i>, produce surfactants that solubilize the oil, while other bacteria degrade the oil into carbon dioxide. In the case of oil spills in the ocean, ongoing, natural bioremediation tends to occur, inasmuch as there are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill. Under ideal conditions, it has been reported that up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile components in oil can be degraded within 1 year of the spill. Other oil fractions containing aromatic and highly branched hydrocarbon chains are more difficult to remove and remain in the environment for longer periods of time. Researchers have genetically engineered other bacteria to consume petroleum products; indeed, the first patent application for a bioremediation application in the U.S. was for a genetically modified oil- eating bacterium.</p><p class="s20">302                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p><span><IMG width="475" height="167" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_436.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  13.10  <span class="s30">(a) Cleaning up oil after the Valdez  spill in Alaska,  the workers  hosed oil from beaches and  then  used a floating boom  to corral the oil, which was  finally skimmed from the water  surface.

We are accustomed to thinking of ourselves as single organisms, but in reality, we are walking ecosystems. There are 10 to 100 times as many bacterial and archaeal cells inhabiting our bodies as we have cells in our bodies. Some of these are in mutually beneficial relationships with us, in which both the human host and the bacterium benefit, while some of the relationships are classified as <b>commensalism</b>, a type of relationship in which the bacterium benefits and the human host is neither benefited nor harmed.<br/>Human gut flora lives in the large intestine and consists of hundreds of species of bacteria and archaea, with different individuals containing different species mixes. The term “flora,” which is usually associated with plants, is traditionally used in this context because bacteria were once classified as plants. The primary functions of these prokaryotes for humans appear to be metabolism of food molecules that we cannot break down, assistance with the absorption of ions by the colon, synthesis of vitamin K, training of the infant immune system, maintenance of the adult immune system, maintenance of the epithelium of the large intestine, and formation of a protective barrier against pathogens.<br/>The surface of the skin is also coated with prokaryotes. The different surfaces of the skin, such as the underarms, the head, and the hands, provide different habitats for different communities of prokaryotes. Unlike with gut flora, the possible beneficial roles of skin flora have not been well studied. However, the few studies conducted so far have identified bacteria that produce antimicrobial compounds as probably responsible for preventing infections by pathogenic bacteria.<br/>Researchers are actively studying the relationships between various diseases and alterations to the composition of human microbial flora.

These cells originated approximately 3.5 billion years ago, which was about 1 billion years after Earth’s formation, and were the only life forms on the planet until eukaryotic cells emerged approximately 2.1 billion years ago. During the prokaryotic reign, photosynthetic prokaryotes evolved that were capable of applying the energy from sunlight to synthesize organic materials (like carbohydrates) from carbon dioxide and an electron source (such as hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or water).<br/>Photosynthesis using water as an electron donor consumes carbon dioxide and releases molecular oxygen (O<span class="s54">2</span>) as a byproduct. The functioning of photosynthetic bacteria over millions of years progressively saturated Earth’s water with oxygen and then oxygenated the atmosphere, which previously contained much greater concentrations of carbon dioxide and much lower concentrations of oxygen. Older anaerobic prokaryotes of the era could not function in their new, aerobic environment. Some species perished, while others survived in the remaining anaerobic environments left on Earth. Still other early prokaryotes evolved mechanisms, such as aerobic respiration, to exploit the oxygenated atmosphere by using<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists                                                                                                                                                    303</p><p>oxygen to store energy contained within organic molecules. Aerobic respiration is a more efficient way of obtaining energy from organic molecules, which contributed to the success of these species (as evidenced by the number and diversity of aerobic organisms living on Earth today). The evolution of aerobic prokaryotes was an important step toward the evolution of the first eukaryote, but several other distinguishing features had to evolve as well.</p><p class="s24">Endosymbiosis</p><p>The origin of eukaryotic cells was largely a mystery until a revolutionary hypothesis was comprehensively examined in the<br/>1960s by Lynn Margulis. The <b>endosymbiotic theory </b>states that eukaryotes are a product of one prokaryotic cell engulfing another, one living within another, and evolving together over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such. This once-revolutionary hypothesis had immediate persuasiveness and is now widely accepted, with work progressing on uncovering the steps involved in this evolutionary process as well as the key players. It has become clear that many nuclear eukaryotic genes and the molecular machinery responsible for replicating and expressing those genes appear closely related to the Archaea. On the other hand, the metabolic organelles and the genes responsible for many energy-harvesting processes had their origins in bacteria. Much remains to be clarified about how this relationship occurred; this continues to be an exciting field of discovery in biology. Several endosymbiotic events likely contributed to the origin of the eukaryotic cell.</p><p class="s34">Mitochondria</p><p>Eukaryotic cells may contain anywhere from one to several thousand mitochondria, depending on the cell’s level of energy consumption. Each mitochondrion measures 1 to 10 micrometers in length and exists in the cell as a moving, fusing, and dividing oblong spheroid (<span class="s32">Figure 13.11</span>). However, mitochondria cannot survive outside the cell. As the atmosphere was oxygenated by photosynthesis, and as successful aerobic prokaryotes evolved, evidence suggests that an ancestral cell engulfed and kept alive a free-living, aerobic prokaryote. This gave the host cell the ability to use oxygen to release energy stored in nutrients. Several lines of evidence support that mitochondria are derived from this endosymbiotic event. Mitochondria are shaped like a specific group of bacteria and are surrounded by two membranes, which would result when one membrane-bound organism was engulfed by another membrane-bound organism. The mitochondrial inner membrane involves substantial infoldings or cristae that resemble the textured outer surface of certain bacteria.<br/><span><IMG width="293" height="208" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_438.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 13.11  <span class="s30">In this transmission electron micrograph of mitochondria in a mammalian lung cell, the cristae, infoldings of the  mitochondrial inner  membrane, can  be  seen in cross-section.

Mitochondria have their own circular DNA chromosome that carries genes similar to those expressed by bacteria. Mitochondria also have special ribosomes and transfer RNAs that resemble these components in prokaryotes.

Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll and play a role in photosynthesis. Genetic and morphological studies suggest that plastids evolved from the endosymbiosis of an ancestral cell that engulfed a photosynthetic cyanobacterium. Plastids are similar in size and shape to cyanobacteria and are enveloped by two or more membranes, corresponding to the inner and outer membranes of cyanobacteria. Like mitochondria, plastids also contain circular genomes and divide by a process reminiscent of prokaryotic cell division. The chloroplasts of red and green algae</p><p class="s20">304                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p>exhibit DNA sequences that are closely related to photosynthetic cyanobacteria, suggesting that red and green algae are direct descendants of this endosymbiotic event.<br/>Mitochondria likely evolved before plastids because all eukaryotes have either functional mitochondria or mitochondria-like organelles. In contrast, plastids are only found in a subset of eukaryotes, such as terrestrial plants and algae. One hypothesis of the evolutionary steps leading to the first eukaryote is summarized in <span class="s32">Figure 13.12</span>.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="262" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_439.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  13.12  <span class="s30">The  first eukaryote may  have  originated from an  ancestral prokaryote that  had  undergone membrane proliferation, compartmentalization of cellular function (into a nucleus, lysosomes, and an endoplasmic reticulum), and the  establishment of endosymbiotic relationships with an  aerobic prokaryote and,  in some cases, a  photosynthetic prokaryote to form mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively.</span></p><p>The exact steps leading to the first eukaryotic cell can only be hypothesized, and some controversy exists regarding which events actually took place and in what order. Spirochete bacteria have been hypothesized to have given rise to microtubules, and a flagellated prokaryote may have contributed the raw materials for eukaryotic flagella and cilia. Other scientists suggest that membrane proliferation and compartmentalization, not endosymbiotic events, led to the development of mitochondria and plastids. However, the vast majority of studies support the endosymbiotic hypothesis of eukaryotic evolution.<br/>The early eukaryotes were unicellular like most protists are today, but as eukaryotes became more complex, the evolution of multicellularity allowed cells to remain small while still exhibiting specialized functions.

During the past two decades, the field of molecular genetics has demonstrated that some protists are more related to animals, plants, or fungi than they are to other protists. For this reason, protist lineages originally classified into the kingdom Protista have been reassigned into new kingdoms or other existing kingdoms. The evolutionary lineages of the protists continue to be examined and debated. In the meantime, the term “protist” still is used informally to describe this tremendously diverse group of eukaryotes. As a collective group, protists display an astounding diversity of morphologies, physiologies, and ecologies.</p><p class="s24">Characteristics of Protists</p><p>There are over 100,000 described living species of protists, and it is unclear how many undescribed species may exist. Since many protists live in symbiotic relationships with other organisms and these relationships are often species specific, there is a huge potential for undescribed protist diversity that matches the diversity of the hosts. As the catchall term for eukaryotic organisms that are not animals, plants, fungi, or any single phylogenetically related group, it is not surprising that few characteristics are common to all protists.<br/>Nearly all protists exist in some type of aquatic environment, including freshwater and marine environments, damp soil, and even snow. Several protist species are <b>parasites </b>that infect animals or plants. A parasite is an organism that lives on or in another organism and feeds on it, often without killing it. A few protist species live on dead organisms or their wastes, and contribute to their decay.</p><p class="s34">Protist Structure</p><p>The cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells. Most protists are microscopic and unicellular, but some true multicellular forms exist. A few protists live as colonies that behave in some ways as a group of free-living cells and in other ways as a multicellular organism. Still other protists are composed of enormous, multinucleate, single cells that look like amorphous blobs of slime or, in other cases, like ferns. In fact, many protist cells are multinucleated; in some species, the nuclei are different sizes and have distinct roles in protist cell function.<br/>Single protist cells range in size from less than a micrometer to the 3-meter lengths of the multinucleate cells of the seaweed <i>Caulerpa</i>. Protist cells may be enveloped by animal-like cell membranes or plant-like cell walls. Others are encased in glassy silica-based shells or wound with <b>pellicles </b>of interlocking protein strips. The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor, preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion.<br/>The majority of protists are motile, but different types of protists have evolved varied modes of movement. Some protists have one or more flagella, which they rotate or whip. Others are covered in rows or tufts of tiny cilia that they beat in coordination to swim. Still others send out lobe-like pseudopodia from anywhere on the cell, anchor the pseudopodium to a substrate, and pull the rest of the cell toward the anchor point. Some protists can move toward light by coupling their locomotion strategy with a light-sensing organ.</p><p class="s20">306                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p class="s24">How Protists Obtain Energy</p><p>Protists exhibit many forms of nutrition and may be aerobic or anaerobic. Photosynthetic protists (photoautotrophs) are characterized by the presence of chloroplasts. Other protists are heterotrophs and consume organic materials (such as other organisms) to obtain nutrition. Amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest particles by a process called phagocytosis, in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward, pinching off an intracellular membranous sac, or vesicle, called a food vacuole (<span class="s32">Figure 13.14</span>). This vesicle then fuses with a lysosome, and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in cellular metabolism. Undigested remains ultimately are expelled from the cell through exocytosis.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="236" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_442.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  13.14  <span class="s30">The stages of phagocytosis include  the engulfment of a food particle,  the digestion of the particle  using hydrolytic enzymes contained within a lysosome, and the expulsion of undigested material  from the cell.</span></p><p>Some heterotrophs absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes, and others are able to use photosynthesis or feed on organic matter, depending on conditions.</p><p class="s24">Reproduction</p><p>Protists reproduce by a variety of mechanisms. Most are capable some form of asexual reproduction, such as binary fission to produce two daughter cells, or multiple fission to divide simultaneously into many daughter cells. Others produce tiny buds that go on to divide and grow to the size of the parental protist. Sexual reproduction, involving meiosis and fertilization, is common among protists, and many protist species can switch from asexual to sexual reproduction when necessary. Sexual reproduction is often associated with periods when nutrients are depleted or environmental changes occur. Sexual reproduction may allow the protist to recombine genes and produce new variations of progeny that may be better suited to surviving in the new environment. However, sexual reproduction is also often associated with cysts that are a protective, resting stage. Depending on their habitat, the cysts may be particularly resistant to temperature extremes, desiccation, or low pH. This strategy also allows certain protists to “wait out” stressors until their environment becomes more favorable for survival or until they are carried (such as by wind, water, or transport on a larger organism) to a different environment because cysts exhibit virtually no cellular metabolism.</p><p class="s24">Protist  Diversity</p><p>With the advent of DNA sequencing, the relationships among protist groups and between protist groups and other eukaryotes are beginning to become clearer. Many relationships that were based on morphological similarities are being replaced by new relationships based on genetic similarities. Protists that exhibit similar morphological features may have evolved analogous structures because of similar selective pressures—rather than because of recent common ancestry. This phenomenon is called convergent evolution. It is one reason why protist classification is so challenging. The emerging classification scheme groups the entire domain Eukaryota into six “supergroups” that contain all of the protists as well as animals, plants, and fungi (<span class="s32">Figure 13.15</span>); these include the <b>Excavata</b>, <b>Chromalveolata</b>, <b>Rhizaria</b>, <b>Archaeplastida</b>, <b>Amoebozoa</b>, and <b>Opisthokonta</b>. The supergroups are believed to be monophyletic; all organisms within each supergroup are believed to have evolved from a single common ancestor, and thus all members are most closely related to each other than to organisms outside that group. There is still evidence lacking for the monophyly of some groups.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists                                                                                                                                                    307</p><p><span><IMG width="416" height="592" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_443.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 13.15  <span class="s30">Protists appear in all six eukaryotic supergroups.</span></p><p class="s24">Human Pathogens</p><p>Many protists are pathogenic parasites that must infect other organisms to survive and propagate. Protist parasites include the  causative  agents  of  malaria,  African  sleeping  sickness,  and  waterborne  gastroenteritis  in  humans.  Other  protist pathogens prey on plants, effecting massive destruction of food crops.</p><p class="s34">Plasmodium Species</p><p>Members of the genus <i>Plasmodium </i>must infect a mosquito and a vertebrate to complete their life cycle. In vertebrates, the parasite develops in liver cells and goes on to infect red blood cells, bursting from and destroying the blood cells with each asexual replication cycle (<span class="s32">Figure 13.16</span>). Of the four <i>Plasmodium </i>species known to infect humans, <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum </i>accounts for 50 percent of all malaria cases and is the primary cause of disease-related fatalities in tropical regions of the world. In 2010, it was estimated that malaria caused between 0.5 and 1 million deaths, mostly in African children. During the course of malaria, <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum </i>can infect and destroy more than one-half of a human’s circulating blood cells, leading to severe anemia. In response to waste products released as the parasites burst from infected blood cells, the host immune system mounts a massive inflammatory response with delirium-inducing fever episodes, as parasites destroy red blood cells, spilling parasite waste into the blood stream. <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum </i>is transmitted to humans by the African malaria mosquito, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>. Techniques to kill, sterilize, or avoid exposure to this highly aggressive mosquito species are crucial to malaria control.</p><p class="s20">308                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p><span><IMG width="256" height="256" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_444.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_445.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  13.16  </span>This light micrograph shows a 100× magnification of red blood cells infected  with <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum  </i>(seen as purple).

The glycoproteins are identified by the immune system as foreign matter, and a specific antibody defense is mounted against the parasite. However, <i>T</i>. <i>brucei </i>has thousands of possible antigens, and with each subsequent generation, the protist switches to a glycoprotein coating with a different molecular structure. In this way, <i>T</i>. <i>brucei </i>is capable of replicating continuously without the immune system ever succeeding in clearing the parasite. Without treatment, African sleeping sickness leads invariably to death because of damage it does to the nervous system. During epidemic periods, mortality from the disease can be high. Greater surveillance and control measures have led to a reduction in reported cases; some of the lowest numbers reported in 50 years (fewer than<br/>10,000 cases in all of sub-Saharan Africa) have happened since 2009.<br/>In Latin America, another species in the genus, <i>T</i>. <i>cruzi</i>, is responsible for Chagas disease. <i>T</i>. <i>cruzi </i>infections are mainly caused by a blood-sucking bug.

They are equally important on the other end of food webs as decomposers.</p><p class="s34">Protists as Food  Sources</p><p>Protists are essential sources of nutrition for many other organisms. In some cases, as in plankton, protists are consumed directly. Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms by carbon fixation. For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae pass on most of their energy to the coral polyps that house them (<span class="s32">Figure 13.19</span>). In this mutually beneficial relationship, the polyps provide a protective environment and nutrients for the zooxanthellae. The polyps secrete the calcium carbonate that builds coral reefs. Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching, and they eventually die. This explains why reef-building corals do not reside in waters deeper than 20 meters: Not enough light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="256" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_451.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 13.19  <span class="s30">Coral polyps obtain  nutrition through  a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellates.</span></p><p>Protists themselves and their products of photosynthesis are essential—directly or indirectly—to the survival of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. As primary producers, protists feed a large proportion of the world’s aquatic species. (On land, terrestrial plants serve as primary producers.) In fact, approximately one-quarter of the world’s photosynthesis is conducted by protists, particularly dinoflagellates, diatoms, and multicellular algae.<br/>Protists do not create food sources only for sea-dwelling organisms. For instance, certain anaerobic species exist in the digestive tracts of termites and wood-eating cockroaches, where they contribute to digesting cellulose ingested by these insects as they bore through wood. The actual enzyme used to digest the cellulose is actually produced by bacteria living within the protist cells. The termite provides the food source to the protist and its bacteria, and the protist and bacteria provide nutrients to the termite by breaking down the cellulose.</p><p class="s34">Agents of Decomposition</p><p>Many fungus-like protists are <b>saprobes</b>, organisms that feed on dead organisms or the waste matter produced by organisms (saprophyte is an equivalent term), and are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter. For instance, many types of oomycetes grow on dead animals or algae. Saprobic protists have the essential function of returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water. This process allows for new plant growth, which in turn generates sustenance for other organisms along the food chain. Indeed, without saprobic species, such as protists, fungi, and bacteria, life would cease to exist as all organic carbon became “tied up” in dead organisms.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists                                                                                                                                                    311</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="149" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_452.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">13.4 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Fungi</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   List the characteristics of fungi<br/>•   Describe fungal parasites and pathogens of plants and infections in humans<br/>•   Describe the importance of fungi to the environment<br/>•   Summarize the beneficial role of fungi in food and beverage preparation and in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="233" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_453.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure 13.20  </span>The (a) familiar mushroom is only one type of fungus.

Indeed, the familiar mushrooms are fungi, but there are many other types of fungi as well (<span class="s32">Figure 13.20</span>). The kingdom Fungi includes an enormous variety of living organisms collectively referred to as Eumycota, or true fungi. While scientists have identified about 100,000 species of fungi, this is only a fraction of the over 1 million species likely present on Earth. Edible mushrooms, yeasts, black mold, and <i>Penicillium notatum </i>(the producer of the antibiotic penicillin) are all members of the kingdom Fungi, which belongs to the domain Eukarya. As eukaryotes, a typical fungal cell contains a true nucleus and many membrane-bound organelles.<br/>Fungi were once considered plant-like organisms; however, DNA comparisons have shown that fungi are more closely related to animals than plants. Fungi are not capable of photosynthesis: They use complex organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon. Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually, whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. Most fungi produce a large number of spores that are disseminated by the wind. Like bacteria, fungi play an essential role in ecosystems, because they are decomposers and participate in the cycling of nutrients by breaking down organic materials into simple molecules.<br/>Fungi often interact with other organisms, forming mutually beneficial or mutualistic associations. Fungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals. For example, Dutch elm disease is a particularly devastating fungal infection that destroys many native species of elm (<i>Ulmus </i>spp.). The fungus infects the vascular system of the tree. It was accidentally introduced to North America in the 1900s and decimated elm trees across the continent. Dutch elm disease is caused by the fungus <i>Ophiostoma ulmi</i>. The elm bark beetle acts as a vector and transmits the disease from tree to tree. Many European and Asiatic elms are less susceptible than American elms.<br/>In humans, fungal infections are generally considered challenging to treat because, unlike bacteria, they do not respond to traditional antibiotic therapy since they are also eukaryotes. These infections may prove deadly for individuals with a compromised immune system.</p><p class="s20">312                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p>Fungi have many commercial applications. The food industry uses yeasts in baking, brewing, and wine making. Many industrial compounds are byproducts of fungal fermentation. Fungi are the source of many commercial enzymes and antibiotics.</p><p class="s24">Cell Structure and Function</p><p>Fungi are eukaryotes and as such have a complex cellular organization. As eukaryotes, fungal cells contain a membrane- bound nucleus. A few types of fungi have structures comparable to the plasmids (loops of DNA) seen in bacteria. Fungal cells also contain mitochondria and a complex system of internal membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.<br/>Fungal cells do not have chloroplasts. Although the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll is absent, many fungi display bright colors, ranging from red to green to black. The poisonous <i>Amanita muscaria </i>(fly agaric) is recognizable by its bright red cap with white patches (<span class="s32">Figure 13.21</span>). Pigments in fungi are associated with the cell wall and play a protective role against ultraviolet radiation. Some pigments are toxic.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="240" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_454.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure 13.21  </span>The poisonous <i>Amanita  muscaria </i>is native to the temperate and boreal  regions of North America. (credit: Christine  Majul)</p><p>Like  plant  cells,  fungal  cells  are  surrounded  by  a  thick  cell  wall;  however,  the  rigid  layers  contain  the  complex polysaccharides chitin and glucan and not cellulose that is used by plants. Chitin, also found in the exoskeleton of insects, gives structural strength to the cell walls of fungi. The cell wall protects the cell from desiccation and predators. Fungi have plasma membranes similar to other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized by ergosterol, a steroid molecule that functions like the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes. Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile. Flagella are produced only by the gametes in the primitive division Chytridiomycota.</p><p class="s34">Growth and Reproduction</p><p>The vegetative body of a fungus is called a <b>thallus </b>and can be unicellular or multicellular. Some fungi are dimorphic because they can go from being unicellular to multicellular depending on environmental conditions. Unicellular fungi are generally referred to as <b>yeasts</b>.<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>(baker’s yeast) and <i>Candida </i>species (the agents of thrush, a common fungal infection) are examples of unicellular fungi.<br/>Most fungi are multicellular organisms. They display two distinct morphological stages: vegetative and reproductive. The vegetative stage is characterized by a tangle of slender thread-like structures called hyphae (singular, <b>hypha</b>), whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous. A mass of hyphae is called a <b>mycelium </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 13.22</span>). It can grow on a surface, in soil or decaying material, in a liquid, or even in or on living tissue. Although individual hypha must be observed under a microscope, the mycelium of a fungus can be very large with some species truly being “the fungus humongous.” The giant <i>Armillaria ostoyae </i>(honey mushroom) is considered the largest organism on Earth, spreading across over 2,000 acres of underground soil in eastern Oregon; it is estimated to be at least 2,400 years old.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists                                                                                                                                                    313</p><p><span><IMG width="298" height="221" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_455.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  13.22  </span>The  mycelium  of the  fungus  <i>Neotestudina rosati  </i>can  be  pathogenic to humans. The  fungus  enters through  a cut or scrape and develops into a mycetoma, a chronic subcutaneous infection. (credit: CDC)</p><p>Most fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by end walls called septa (singular, <b>septum</b>). In most divisions (like plants, fungal phyla are called <i>divisions </i>by tradition) of fungi, tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hyphae. They are described as perforated septa. The hyphae in bread <b>molds </b>(which belong to the division Zygomycota) are not separated by septa. They are formed of large cells containing many nuclei, an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae.<br/>Fungi thrive in environments that are moist and slightly acidic, and can grow with or without light. They vary in their oxygen requirements. Most fungi are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive. Other species, such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, are obligate anaerobes, meaning that they cannot grow and reproduce in an environment with oxygen. Yeasts are intermediate: They grow best in the presence of oxygen but can use fermentation in the absence of oxygen. The alcohol produced from yeast fermentation is used in wine and beer production, and the carbon dioxide they produce carbonates beer and sparkling wine, and makes bread rise.<br/>Fungi can reproduce sexually or asexually. In both sexual and asexual reproduction, fungi produce spores that disperse from the parent organism by either floating in the wind or hitching a ride on an animal. Fungal spores are smaller and lighter than plant seeds, but they are not usually released as high in the air. The giant puffball mushroom bursts open and releases trillions of spores: The huge number of spores released increases the likelihood of spores landing in an environment that will support growth (<span class="s32">Figure 13.23</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="384" height="204" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_456.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  13.23  <span class="s30">The  (a)  giant  puffball mushroom releases  (b) a  cloud  of spores when  it reaches maturity.

In addition, fungi do not fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. Like animals, they must obtain it from their diet. However, unlike most animals that ingest food and then digest it internally in specialized organs, fungi perform these steps in the reverse order. Digestion precedes ingestion. First, exoenzymes, enzymes that catalyze reactions on compounds outside of the cell, are transported out of the hyphae where</p><p class="s20">314                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p>they break down nutrients in the environment. Then, the smaller molecules produced by the external digestion are absorbed through the large surface areas of the mycelium. As with animal cells, the fungal storage polysaccharide is glycogen rather than starch, as found in plants.<br/>Fungi are mostly saprobes, organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter. They obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic matter, mainly plant material. Fungal exoenzymes are able to break down insoluble polysaccharides, such as the cellulose and lignin of dead wood, into readily absorbable glucose molecules. Decomposers are important components of ecosystems, because they return nutrients locked in dead bodies to a form that is usable for other organisms. This role is discussed in more detail later. Because of their varied metabolic pathways, fungi fulfill an important ecological role and are being investigated as potential tools in bioremediation. For example, some species of fungi can be used to break down diesel oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Other species take up heavy metals such as cadmium and lead.</p><p class="s24">Fungal  Diversity</p><p>The kingdom Fungi contains four major divisions that were established according to their mode of sexual reproduction. Polyphyletic, unrelated fungi that reproduce without a sexual cycle, are placed for convenience in a fifth division, and a sixth major fungal group that does not fit well with any of the previous five has recently been described. Not all mycologists agree with this scheme. Rapid advances in molecular biology and the sequencing of 18S rRNA (a component of ribosomes) continue to reveal new and different relationships between the various categories of fungi.<br/>The  traditional  divisions  of  Fungi  are  the  <b>Chytridiomycota  </b>(chytrids),  the  <b>Zygomycota  </b>(conjugated  fungi),  the <b>Ascomycota </b>(sac fungi), and the <b>Basidiomycota </b>(club fungi). An older classification scheme grouped fungi that strictly use asexual reproduction into Deuteromycota, a group that is no longer in use. The <b>Glomeromycota </b>belong to a newly described group (<span class="s32">Figure 13.24</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="482" height="399" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_457.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  13.24  <span class="s30">Divisions  of fungi include  (a) chytrids,  (b) conjugated fungi, (c) sac  fungi, and  (d) club fungi.

Plant diseases have ruined crops, bringing widespread famine. Most plant pathogens are fungi that cause tissue decay and eventual death of the host (<span class="s32">Figure 13.25</span>). In addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins. Fungi are also responsible for food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops. For example, the fungus <i>Claviceps purpurea </i>causes ergot, a disease of cereal crops (especially of rye). Although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot’s alkaloid toxins on humans and animals are of much greater significance: In animals, the disease is referred to as ergotism. The most common signs and symptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle. The active ingredient of ergot is lysergic acid, which is a precursor of the drug LSD. Smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal pathogens that affect crops.<br/><span><IMG width="481" height="267" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_458.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  13.25  </span>Some fungal pathogens include  (a) green mold on grapefruit,  (b) fungus  on grapes, (c) powdery  mildew on a zinnia, and (d) stem  rust on a sheaf of barley.

Periodically, harvests of nuts and grains are tainted by aflatoxins, leading to massive recall of produce, sometimes ruining producers, and causing food shortages in developing countries.</p><p class="s24">Animal and Human Parasites and Pathogens</p><p>Fungi can affect animals, including humans, in several ways. Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues. Humans and other animals can be poisoned by eating toxic mushrooms or foods contaminated by fungi. In addition, individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions. Fungal infections are generally very difficult to treat because, unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotes. Antibiotics only target prokaryotic cells, whereas compounds that kill fungi also adversely affect the eukaryotic animal host.<br/>Many fungal infections ( <b>mycoses</b>) are superficial and termed cutaneous (meaning “skin”) mycoses. They are usually visible on the skin of the animal. Fungi that cause the superficial mycoses of the epidermis, hair, and nails rarely spread to the underlying tissue (<span class="s32">Figure 13.26</span>). These fungi are often misnamed “dermatophytes” from the Greek <i>dermis </i>skin and <i>phyte </i>plant, but they are not plants. Dermatophytes are also called “ringworms” because of the red ring that they cause on skin (although the ring is caused by fungi, not a worm). These fungi secrete extracellular enzymes that break down keratin (a protein found in hair, skin, and nails), causing a number of conditions such as athlete’s foot, jock itch, and other cutaneous fungal infections. These conditions are usually treated with over-the-counter topical creams and powders, and are easily cleared. More persistent, superficial mycoses may require prescription oral medications.</p><p class="s20">316                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p><span><IMG width="481" height="304" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_459.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  13.26  </span>(a) Ringworm  presents as a red  ring on the  skin.

Georg, CDC; credit c: modification of work by M Renz,  CDC; scale-bar data  from Matt Russell)</p><p>Systemic mycoses spread to internal organs, most commonly entering the body through the respiratory system. For example, coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is commonly found in the southwestern United States, where the fungus resides in the dust. Once inhaled, the spores develop in the lungs and cause signs and symptoms similar to those of tuberculosis. Histoplasmosis (<span class="s32">Figure 13.26</span><b>c</b>) is caused by the dimorphic fungus <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>; it causes pulmonary infections and, in rare cases, swelling of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord. Treatment of many fungal diseases requires the use of antifungal medications that have serious side effects.<br/>Opportunistic mycoses are fungal infections that are either common in all environments or part of the normal biota. They affect mainly individuals who have a compromised immune system. Patients in the late stages of AIDS suffer from opportunistic mycoses, such as <i>Pneumocystis</i>, which can be life threatening. The yeast <i>Candida </i>spp., which is a common member of the natural biota, can grow unchecked if the pH, the immune defenses, or the normal population of bacteria is altered, causing yeast infections of the vagina or mouth (oral thrush).<br/>Fungi may even take on a predatory lifestyle. In soil environments that are poor in nitrogen, some fungi resort to predation of nematodes (small roundworms). Species of <i>Arthrobotrys </i>fungi have a number of mechanisms to trap nematodes. For example, they have constricting rings within their network of hyphae. The rings swell when the nematode touches it and closes around the body of the nematode, thus trapping it. The fungus extends specialized hyphae that can penetrate the body of the worm and slowly digest the hapless prey.</p><p class="s24">Beneficial Fungi</p><p>Fungi play a crucial role in the balance of ecosystems. They colonize most habitats on Earth, preferring dark, moist conditions. They can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms, like lichens. Fungi are not obvious in the way that large animals or tall trees are. Yet, like bacteria, they are major decomposers of nature. With their versatile metabolism, fungi break down organic matter that is insoluble and would not be recycled otherwise.</p><p class="s34">Importance to Ecosystems</p><p>Food webs would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter and fungi are key participants in this process. Decomposition allows for cycling of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus back into the environment so they are available to living things, rather than being trapped in dead organisms. Fungi are particularly important because they have evolved enzymes to break down cellulose and lignin, components of plant cell walls that few other organisms are able to digest, releasing their carbon content.<br/>Fungi are also involved in ecologically important coevolved symbioses, both mutually beneficial and pathogenic with organisms from the other kingdoms. <b>Mycorrhiza</b>, a term combining the Greek roots <i>myco </i>meaning fungus and <i>rhizo</i><br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists                                                                                                                                                    317</p><p>meaning root, refers to the association between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi. Somewhere between 80–90 percent of all plant species have mycorrhizal partners. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungal mycelia use their extensive network of hyphae and large surface area in contact with the soil to channel water and minerals from the soil into the plant. In exchange, the plant supplies the products of photosynthesis to fuel the metabolism of the fungus. Ectomycorrhizae (“outside” mycorrhiza) depend on fungi enveloping the roots in a sheath (called a mantle) and a net of hyphae that extends into the roots between cells. In a second type, the Glomeromycota fungi form arbuscular mycorrhiza. In these mycorrhiza, the fungi form arbuscles, a specialized highly branched hypha, which penetrate root cells and are the sites of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant. Orchids rely on a third type of mycorrhiza. Orchids form small seeds without much storage to sustain germination and growth. Their seeds will not germinate without a mycorrhizal partner (usually Basidiomycota). After nutrients in the seed are depleted, fungal symbionts support the growth of the orchid by providing necessary carbohydrates and minerals. Some orchids continue to be mycorrhizal throughout their lifecycle.</p><p class="s27">Lichens <span class="p">blanket many rocks and tree bark, displaying a range of colors and textures. Lichens are important pioneer organisms that colonize rock surfaces in otherwise lifeless environments such as are created by glacial recession. The lichen is able to leach nutrients from the rocks and break them down in the first step to creating soil. Lichens are also present in mature habitats on rock surfaces or the trunks of trees. They are an important food source for caribou. Lichens are not a single organism, but rather a fungus (usually an Ascomycota or Basidiomycota species) living in close contact with a photosynthetic organism (an alga or cyanobacterium). The body of a lichen, referred to as a thallus, is formed of hyphae wrapped around the green partner. The photosynthetic organism provides carbon and energy in the form of carbohydrates and receives protection from the elements by the thallus of the fungal partner. Some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, contributing nitrogenous compounds to the association. In return, the fungus supplies minerals and protection from dryness and excessive light by encasing the algae in its mycelium. The fungus also attaches the symbiotic organism to the substrate.</span></p><p>Fungi have evolved mutualistic associations with numerous arthropods. The association between species of Basidiomycota and scale insects is one example. The fungal mycelium covers and protects the insect colonies. The scale insects foster a flow of nutrients from the parasitized plant to the fungus. In a second example, leaf-cutting ants of Central and South America literally farm fungi. They cut disks of leaves from plants and pile them up in gardens. Fungi are cultivated in these gardens, digesting the cellulose that the ants cannot break down. Once smaller sugar molecules are produced and consumed by the fungi, they in turn become a meal for the ants. The insects also patrol their garden, preying on competing fungi. Both ants and fungi benefit from the association. The fungus receives a steady supply of leaves and freedom from competition, while the ants feed on the fungi they cultivate.</p><p class="s34">Importance to Humans</p><p>Although we often think of fungi as organisms that cause diseases and rot food, fungi are important to human life on many levels. As we have seen, they influence the well-being of human populations on a large scale because they help nutrients cycle in ecosystems. They have other ecosystem roles as well. For example, as animal pathogens, fungi help to control the population of damaging pests. These fungi are very specific to the insects they attack and do not infect other animals or plants. The potential to use fungi as microbial insecticides is being investigated, with several species already on the market. For example, the fungus <i>Beauveria bassiana </i>is a pesticide that is currently being tested as a possible biological control for the recent spread of emerald ash borer. It has been released in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland.<br/>The mycorrhizal relationship between fungi and plant roots is essential for the productivity of farmland. Without the fungal partner in the root systems, 80–90% of trees and grasses would not survive. Mycorrhizal fungal inoculants are available as soil amendments from gardening supply stores and promoted by supporters of organic agriculture.<br/>We  also  eat  some  types  of  fungi.  Mushrooms  figure  prominently  in  the  human  diet.  Morels,  shiitake  mushrooms, chanterelles, and truffles are considered delicacies (<span class="s32">Figure 13.27</span>). The humble meadow mushroom, <i>Agaricus campestris</i>, appears in many dishes. Molds of the genus <i>Penicillium </i>ripen many cheeses. They originate in the natural environment such as the caves of Roquefort, France, where wheels of sheep milk cheese are stacked to capture the molds responsible for the blue veins and pungent taste of the cheese.</p><p class="s20">318                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists</p><p><span><IMG width="240" height="319" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_460.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  13.27  <span class="s30">The  morel  mushroom is an  ascomycete that  is much  appreciated for its delicate taste.

Wild yeasts are acquired from the environment and used to ferment sugars into CO<span class="s54">2 </span>and ethyl alcohol under anaerobic conditions. It is now possible to purchase isolated strains of wild yeasts from different wine-making regions. Pasteur was instrumental in developing a reliable strain of brewer’s yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, for the French brewing industry in the late 1850s. It was one of the first examples of biotechnology patenting. Yeast is also used to make breads that rise. The carbon dioxide they produce is responsible for the bubbles produced in the dough that become the air pockets of the baked bread.<br/>Many secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance. Antibiotics are naturally produced by fungi to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, and limit competition in the natural environment. Valuable drugs isolated from fungi include the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine (which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant), the precursors of steroid hormones, and ergot alkaloids used to stop bleeding.

During the first 2 billion years, the atmosphere was anoxic and only anaerobic organisms were able to live. Cyanobacteria began the oxygenation of the atmosphere. The increase in oxygen concentration allowed the evolution of other life forms.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 13 | Diversity of Microbes,  Fungi, and Protists                                                                                                                                                    321</p><p>Prokaryotes (domains Archaea and Bacteria) are single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus. They have a single piece of circular DNA in the nucleoid area of the cell. Most prokaryotes have cell wall outside the plasma membrane. Bacteria and Archaea differ in the compositions of their cell membranes and the characteristics of their cell walls.<br/>Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan. Archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan. Bacteria can be divided into two major groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. Gram-positive organisms have a thick cell wall. Gram-negative organisms have a thin cell wall and an outer membrane. Prokaryotes use diverse sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules. Phototrophs obtain their energy from sunlight, whereas chemotrophs obtain it from chemical compounds.<br/>Infectious diseases caused by bacteria remain among the leading causes of death worldwide. The excessive use of antibiotics to control bacterial infections has resulted in resistant forms of bacteria being selected. Foodborne diseases result from the consumption of contaminated food, pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or parasites that contaminate food. Prokaryotes are used in human food products. Microbial bioremediation is the use of microbial metabolism to remove pollutants. The human body contains a huge community of prokaryotes, many of which provide beneficial services such as the development and maintenance of the immune system, nutrition, and protection from pathogens.</p><p class="s52">13.2 Eukaryotic Origins</p><p>The first eukaryotes evolved from ancestral prokaryotes by a process that involved membrane proliferation, the loss of a cell wall, the evolution of a cytoskeleton, and the acquisition and evolution of organelles. Nuclear eukaryotic genes appear to have had an origin in the Archaea, whereas the energy machinery of eukaryotic cells appears to be bacterial in origin. The mitochondria and plastids originated from endosymbiotic events when ancestral cells engulfed an aerobic bacterium (in the case of mitochondria) and a photosynthetic bacterium (in the case of chloroplasts). The evolution of mitochondria likely preceded the evolution of chloroplasts. There is evidence of secondary endosymbiotic events in which plastids appear to be the result of endosymbiosis after a previous endosymbiotic event.</p><p class="s52">13.3 Protists</p><p>Protists are extremely diverse in terms of biological and ecological characteristics due in large part to the fact that they are an artificial assemblage of phylogenetically unrelated groups. Protists display highly varied cell structures, several types of reproductive strategies, virtually every possible type of nutrition, and varied habitats. Most single-celled protists are<br/>motile, but these organisms use diverse structures for transportation.<br/>The process of classifying protists into meaningful groups is ongoing, but genetic data in the past 20 years have clarified many relationships that were previously unclear or mistaken. The majority view at present is to order all eukaryotes into six supergroups. The goal of this classification scheme is to create clusters of species that all are derived from a common ancestor.</p><p class="s52">13.4 Fungi</p><p>Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that appeared on land over 450 million years ago. They are heterotrophs and contain neither photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophylls nor organelles such as chloroplasts. Because they feed on decaying and dead matter, they are saprobes. Fungi are important decomposers and release essential elements into the environment. External enzymes digest nutrients that are absorbed by the body of the fungus called a thallus. A thick cell wall made of chitin surrounds the cell. Fungi can be unicellular as yeasts or develop a network of filaments called a mycelium, often described as mold. Most species multiply by asexual and sexual reproductive cycles, and display an alternation of generations.<br/>The divisions of fungi are the Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Glomeromycota, and the<br/>Deuteromycota, a polyphyletic group.<br/>Fungi establish parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Fungal diseases can decimate crops and spoil food during storage. Compounds produced by fungi can be toxic to humans and other animals. Mycoses are infections caused by fungi. Superficial mycoses affect the skin, whereas systemic mycoses spread through the body. Fungal infections are difficult to cure.<br/>Fungi have colonized all environments on Earth but are most often found in cool, dark, moist places with a supply of decaying material. Fungi are important decomposers because they are saprobes. Many successful mutualistic relationships involve a fungus and another organism. They establish complex mycorrhizal associations with the roots of plants. Lichens are a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic organism, usually an alga or cyanobacterium.<br/>Fungi are important to everyday human life. Fungi are important decomposers in most ecosystems. Mycorrhizal fungi are essential for the growth of most plants.

The showy opium poppy is valued both as an ornamental flower and as a source of potent opiate compounds.<br/>Current evolutionary thought holds that all plants are monophyletic: that is, descendants of a single common ancestor. The evolutionary transition from water to land imposed severe constraints on the ancestors of contemporary plants. Plants had to evolve strategies to avoid drying out, to disperse reproductive cells in air, for structural support, and to filter sunlight. While seed plants developed adaptations that allowed them to populate even the most arid habitats on Earth, full independence from water did not happen in all plants, and most seedless plants still require a moist environment.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_463.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">14.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>The Plant Kingdom</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the major characteristics of the plant kingdom<br/>•   Discuss the challenges to plant life on land<br/>•   Describe the adaptations that allowed plants to colonize land<br/>Plants are a large and varied group of organisms. There are close to 300,000 species of catalogued plants.</p><p class="s55">[1]</p><p>Of these, about<br/>260,000 are plants that produce seeds. Mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants are all members of the plant kingdom. The plant kingdom contains mostly photosynthetic organisms; a few parasitic forms have lost the ability to photosynthesize. The process of photosynthesis uses chlorophyll, which is located in organelles called chloroplasts. Plants possess cell walls containing cellulose. Most plants reproduce sexually, but they also have diverse methods of asexual reproduction. Plants exhibit indeterminate growth, meaning they do not have a final body form, but continue to grow body mass until they die.</p><p class="s24">Plant Adaptations to Life on Land</p><p>As organisms adapt to life on land, they have to contend with several challenges in the terrestrial environment. Water has been described as “the stuff of life.” The cell’s interior—the medium in which most small molecules dissolve and diffuse, and in which the majority of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place—is a watery soup. Desiccation, or drying out, is a constant danger for an organism exposed to air. Even when parts of a plant are close to a source of water, their aerial structures are likely to dry out. Water provides buoyancy to organisms that live in aquatic habitats. On land, plants need to develop structural support in air—a medium that does not give the same lift. Additionally, the male gametes must reach the female gametes using new strategies because swimming is no longer possible. Finally, both gametes and zygotes must be protected from drying out. The successful land plants evolved strategies to deal with all of these challenges, although not all adaptations appeared at once. Some species did not move far from an aquatic environment, whereas others left the water and went on to conquer the driest environments on Earth.<br/>To balance these survival challenges, life on land offers several advantages. First, sunlight is abundant. On land, the spectral quality of light absorbed by the photosynthetic pigment, chlorophyll, is not filtered out by water or competing photosynthetic  species  in  the  water  column  above.  Second,  carbon  dioxide  is  more  readily  available  because  its concentration is higher in air than in water. Additionally, land plants evolved before land animals; therefore, until dry land was colonized by animals, no predators threatened the well-being of plants. This situation changed as animals emerged from the water and found abundant sources of nutrients in the established flora. In turn, plants evolved strategies to deter predation: from spines and thorns to toxic chemicals.<br/>The early land plants, like the early land animals, did not live far from an abundant source of water and developed survival strategies to combat dryness. One of these strategies is drought tolerance. Mosses, for example, can dry out to a brown and brittle mat, but as soon as rain makes water available, mosses will soak it up and regain their healthy, green appearance. Another strategy is to colonize environments with high humidity where droughts are uncommon. Ferns, an early lineage of plants, thrive in damp and cool places, such as the understory of temperate forests. Later, plants moved away from aquatic environments using resistance to desiccation, rather than tolerance. These plants, like the cactus, minimize water loss to such an extent they can survive in the driest environments on Earth.<br/>In addition to adaptations specific to life on land, land plants exhibit adaptations that were responsible for their diversity and predominance in terrestrial ecosystems. Four major adaptations are found in many terrestrial plants: the alternation of<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_464.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">1.   A.D.

The sporophyte bears the <b>sporangia </b>(singular, sporangium), organs that first appeared in the land plants. The term “sporangia” literally means “spore in a vessel,” as it is a reproductive sac that contains spores. Inside the multicellular sporangia, the diploid sporocytes, or mother cells, produce haploid spores by meiosis, which reduces the 2<i>n </i>chromosome number to 1<i>n</i>. The spores are later released by the sporangia and disperse in the environment. Two different types of spores are produced in land plants, resulting in the separation of sexes at different points in the life cycle. Seedless nonvascular plants (more appropriately referred to as “seedless nonvascular plants with a dominant gametophyte phase”) produce only one kind of spore, and are called <b>homosporous</b>. After germinating from a spore, the gametophyte produces both male and female <b>gametangia</b>, usually on the same individual. In contrast, <b>heterosporous </b>plants produce two morphologically different types of spores. The male spores are called microspores because of their smaller size; the comparatively larger megaspores will develop into the female gametophyte. Heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants.<br/>When the haploid spore germinates, it generates a multicellular gametophyte by mitosis. The gametophyte supports the zygote formed from the fusion of gametes and the resulting young sporophyte or vegetative form, and the cycle begins anew (<span class="s32">Figure 14.3 </span>and <span class="s32">Figure 14.4</span>).</p><p class="s20">328                                                                                                                                                                                                              Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants</p><p><span><IMG width="476" height="271" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_466.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  14.3 <span class="s30">This life cycle of a fern shows alternation of generations with a dominant sporophyte stage.

This substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids, and gives most pollen its yellow color. Sporopollenin is unusually resistant to chemical and biological degradation. Its toughness explains the existence of well-preserved fossils of pollen. Sporopollenin was once thought to be an innovation of land plants; however, the green algae <i>Coleochaetes </i>is now known to form spores that contain sporopollenin.<br/>Protection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants. The vulnerable embryo must be sheltered from desiccation and other environmental hazards. In both seedless and seed plants, the female gametophyte provides nutrition, and in seed plants, the embryo is also protected as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants                                                                                                                                                                                       329</p><p class="s34">Gametangia in the Seedless Plants</p><p>Gametangia (singular, gametangium) are structures on the gametophytes of seedless plants in which gametes are produced by mitosis.

The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte.</p><p class="s34">Apical Meristems</p><p>The shoots and roots of plants increase in length through rapid cell division within a tissue called the <b>apical meristem </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 14.5</span>). The apical meristem is a cap of cells at the shoot tip or root tip made of undifferentiated cells that continue to proliferate throughout the life of the plant. Meristematic cells give rise to all the specialized tissues of the plant. Elongation of the shoots and roots allows a plant to access additional space and resources: light in the case of the shoot, and water and minerals in the case of roots. A separate meristem, called the lateral meristem, produces cells that increase the diameter of stems and tree trunks. Apical meristems are an adaptation to allow vascular plants to grow in directions essential to their survival: upward to greater availability of sunlight, and downward into the soil to obtain water and essential minerals.<br/><span><IMG width="278" height="303" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_468.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  14.5  <span class="s30">This apple  seedling is an example of a plant in which the apical  meristem gives  rise to new  shoots and root growth.</span></p><p class="s24">Additional Land Plant Adaptations</p><p>As plants adapted to dry land and became independent of the constant presence of water in damp habitats, new organs and structures made their appearance. Early land plants did not grow above a few inches off the ground, and on these low mats, they competed for light. By evolving a shoot and growing taller, individual plants captured more light. Because air offers substantially less support than water, land plants incorporated more rigid molecules in their stems (and later, tree trunks). The evolution of vascular tissue for the distribution of water and solutes was a necessary prerequisite for plants to evolve larger bodies. The vascular system contains xylem and phloem tissues. Xylem conducts water and minerals taken from the soil up to the shoot; phloem transports food derived from photosynthesis throughout the entire plant. The root system that evolved to take up water and minerals also anchored the increasingly taller shoot in the soil.<br/>In land plants, a waxy, waterproof cover called a cuticle coats the aerial parts of the plant: leaves and stems. The cuticle also prevents intake of carbon dioxide needed for the synthesis of carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Stomata, or pores, that open and close to regulate traffic of gases and water vapor therefore appeared in plants as they moved into drier habitats.<br/>Plants cannot avoid predatory animals. Instead, they synthesize a large range of poisonous secondary metabolites: complex organic molecules such as alkaloids, whose noxious smells and unpleasant taste deter animals. These toxic compounds can cause severe diseases and even death.<br/>Additionally, as plants coevolved with animals, sweet and nutritious metabolites were developed to lure animals into providing valuable assistance in dispersing pollen grains, fruit, or seeds. Plants have been coevolving with animal associates for hundreds of millions of years (<span class="s32">Figure 14.6</span>).</p><p class="s20">330                                                                                                                                                                                                              Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants</p><p><span><IMG width="376" height="347" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_469.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 14.6 <span class="s30">Plants have  evolved  various  adaptations to life on land.

Paleobotany addresses  these questions by specializing in the  study  of extinct  plants.  Paleobotanists analyze specimens retrieved from field studies, reconstituting the morphology  of organisms that have  long disappeared. They trace  the evolution  of plants by  following the  modifications in plant  morphology, and  shed light on  the  connection between  existing plants  by identifying common ancestors that  display  the  same traits.  This  field seeks to find transitional species that  bridge  gaps in the  path  to the  development of modern organisms. Fossils are  formed  when organisms are  trapped in sediments or  environments where  their  shapes are  preserved (<span class="s32">Figure  14.7</span>). Paleobotanists determine the  geological age  of specimens and  the  nature of their environment using  the geological sediments and  fossil organisms surrounding them.  The  activity requires great  care  to preserve the integrity of the delicate fossils and the layers  in which they are found.<br/>One  of  the  most  exciting  recent developments in  paleobotany is  the  use   of  analytical   chemistry and molecular biology  to study  fossils.  Preservation of molecular structures requires an  environment free  of oxygen,  since  oxidation  and  degradation of material  through  the  activity  of microorganisms depend  on the  presence of oxygen.  One  example of the  use  of analytical  chemistry and  molecular biology is in the identification  of oleanane, a compound that deters pests and  which, up to this point, appears to be unique to flowering plants.  Oleanane was  recovered from sediments dating  from the  Permian, much  earlier  than the current  dates given for the appearance of the first flowering plants.  Fossilized nucleic  acids—DNA  and RNA—yield the most information. Their sequences are analyzed and compared to those of living and related organisms. Through  this analysis, evolutionary relationships can be built for plant lineages.<br/>Some paleobotanists are skeptical of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of molecular fossils. For one, the chemical materials of interest degrade rapidly during initial isolation  when  exposed to air, as well as in further manipulations. There  is always  a high risk of contaminating the specimens with extraneous material, mostly  from microorganisms. Nevertheless, as technology is refined,  the  analysis of DNA from fossilized plants  will provide invaluable information on the evolution of plants  and their adaptation to an ever-changing environment.</p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure 14.7 </span>This fossil of a palm leaf (<i>Palmacites </i>sp.) discovered in Wyoming dates to about  40 million years ago.</p><p class="s24">The Major Divisions of Land Plants</p><p>Land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue, as detailed in <span class="s32">Figure 14.8</span>.

The first bryophytes most probably appeared in the Ordovician period, about 490 million years ago. Because of the lack of lignin—the tough polymer in cell walls in the stems of vascular plants—and other resistant structures, the likelihood of bryophytes forming fossils is rather small, though some spores made up of sporopollenin have been discovered that have been attributed to early bryophytes. By the Silurian period (440 million years ago), however, vascular plants had spread throughout the continents. This fact is used as evidence that nonvascular plants must have preceded the Silurian period.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants                                                                                                                                                                                       333</p><p>There are about 18,000 species of bryophytes, which thrive mostly in damp habitats, although some grow in deserts. They constitute the major flora of inhospitable environments like the tundra, where their small size and tolerance to desiccation offer distinct advantages. They do not have the specialized cells that conduct fluids found in the vascular plants, and generally lack lignin. In bryophytes, water and nutrients circulate inside specialized conducting cells. Although the name nontracheophyte is more accurate, bryophytes are commonly referred to as nonvascular plants.<br/>In a bryophyte, all the conspicuous vegetative organs belong to the haploid organism, or gametophyte. The diploid sporophyte is barely noticeable. The gametes formed by bryophytes swim using flagella. The sporangium, the multicellular sexual reproductive structure, is present in bryophytes. The embryo also remains attached to the parent plant, which nourishes it. This is a characteristic of land plants.<br/>The bryophytes are divided into three divisions (in plants, the taxonomic level “division” is used instead of phylum): the liverworts, or Marchantiophyta; the hornworts, or Anthocerotophyta; and the mosses, or true Bryophyta.</p><p class="s24">Liverworts</p><p class="s27">Liverworts <span class="p">(Marchantiophyta) may be viewed as the plants most closely related to the ancestor that moved to land.

There are about 100 described species of hornworts. The dominant phase of the life cycle of hornworts is the short, blue-green gametophyte. The sporophyte is the defining characteristic of the group.

Their habitats vary from the tundra, where they are the main vegetation, to the understory of tropical forests. In the tundra, their shallow rhizoids allow them to fasten to a substrate without digging into the frozen soil. They slow down erosion, store moisture and soil nutrients, and provide shelter for small animals and food for larger herbivores, such as the musk ox. Mosses are very sensitive to air pollution and are used to monitor the quality of air. The sensitivity of mosses to copper salts makes these salts a common ingredient of compounds marketed to eliminate mosses in lawns (<span class="s32">Figure 14.12</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="300" height="225" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_476.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure     14.12     <span class="s30">This    green    feathery   moss    has     reddish-brown   sporophytes    growing     upward.

The simplest arrangement of conductive cells shows a pattern of xylem at the center surrounded by phloem. <b>Xylem </b>is the tissue responsible for long-distance transport of water and minerals, the transfer of water-soluble growth factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs, and storage of water and nutrients.<br/>A second type of vascular tissue is <b>phloem</b>, which transports sugars, proteins, and other solutes through the plant. Phloem cells are divided into sieve elements, or conducting cells, and supportive tissue. Together, xylem and phloem tissues form the vascular system of plants.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants                                                                                                                                                                                       335</p><p class="s34">Roots: Support for the Plant</p><p>Roots are not well preserved in the fossil record; nevertheless, it seems that they did appear later in evolution than vascular tissue. The development of an extensive network of roots represented a significant new feature of vascular plants. Thin rhizoids attached the bryophytes to the substrate. Their rather flimsy filaments did not provide a strong anchor for the plant; neither did they absorb water and nutrients. In contrast, roots, with their prominent vascular tissue system, transfer water and minerals from the soil to the rest of the plant. The extensive network of roots that penetrates deep in the ground to reach sources of water also stabilizes trees by acting as ballast and an anchor. The majority of roots establish a symbiotic relationship with fungi, forming mycorrhizae. In the mycorrhizae, fungal hyphae grow around the root and within the root around the cells, and in some instances within the cells. This benefits the plant by greatly increasing the surface area for absorption.</p><p class="s34">Leaves, Sporophylls, and Strobili</p><p>A third adaptation marks seedless vascular plants. Accompanying the prominence of the sporophyte and the development of vascular tissue, the appearance of true leaves improved photosynthetic efficiency. Leaves capture more sunlight with their increased surface area.<br/>In addition to photosynthesis, leaves play another role in the life of the plants. Pinecones, mature fronds of ferns, and flowers are all <b>sporophylls</b>—leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia. <b>Strobili </b>are structures that contain the sporangia. They are prominent in conifers and are known commonly as cones: for example, the pine cones of pine trees.</p><p class="s24">Seedless Vascular Plants</p><p>By the Late Devonian period (385 million years ago), plants had evolved vascular tissue, well-defined leaves, and root systems. With these advantages, plants increased in height and size. During the Carboniferous period (359–299 million years ago), swamp forests of club mosses and horsetails, with some specimens reaching more than 30 meters tall, covered most of the land. These forests gave rise to the extensive coal deposits that gave the Carboniferous its name. In seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte became the dominant phase of the lifecycle.<br/>Water is still required for fertilization of seedless vascular plants, and most favor a moist environment. Modern-day seedless vascular plants include club mosses, horsetails, ferns, and whisk ferns.</p><p class="s34">Club Mosses</p><p>The <b>club mosses</b>, or Lycophyta, are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants. They dominated the landscape of the Carboniferous period, growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests. Today’s club mosses are diminutive, evergreen plants consisting of a stem (which may be branched) and small leaves called microphylls (<span class="s32">Figure 14.13</span>). The division Lycophyta consists of close to 1,000 species, including quillworts (<i>Isoetales</i>), club mosses (Lycopodiales), and spike mosses (Selaginellales): none of which is a true moss.<br/><span><IMG width="298" height="231" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_477.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 14.13  <span class="s35">Lycopodium clavatum </span><span class="s30">is a club moss.

A third group of plants in the Pterophyta, the horsetails, is sometimes classified separately from ferns. <b>Horsetails </b>have a single genus, <i>Equisetum</i>. They are the survivors of a large group of plants, known as Arthrophyta, which produced large trees and entire swamp forests in the Carboniferous.

Leaves and branches come out as whorls from the evenly spaced rings. The needle-shaped leaves do not contribute greatly to photosynthesis, the majority of which takes place in the green stem (<span class="s32">Figure 14.15</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="278" height="370" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_479.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 14.15  <span class="s30">Thin leaves originating at the joints are noticeable on the horsetail plant.

Ferns form large leaves and branching roots. In contrast, <b>whisk ferns</b>, the psilophytes, lack both roots and leaves, which were probably lost by evolutionary reduction. Evolutionary reduction is a process by which natural selection reduces the size of a structure that is no longer favorable in a particular environment. Photosynthesis takes place in the green stem of a whisk fern. Small yellow knobs form at the tip of the branch stem and contain the sporangia. Whisk ferns have been classified outside the true ferns; however, recent comparative analysis of DNA suggests that this group may have lost both vascular tissue and roots through evolution, and is actually closely related to ferns.<br/>With their large fronds, <b>ferns </b>are the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants (<span class="s32">Figure 14.16</span>).

Landscape layout  can  encompass a small private  space, like a backyard garden; public gathering places, like Central  Park  in New York City; or an entire  city plan, like Pierre  L’Enfant’s design for Washington, DC.<br/>A  landscape  designer will plan  traditional   public  spaces—such as  botanical gardens, parks,   college campuses, gardens, and  larger  developments—as well  as natural   areas and  private  gardens (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">14.18<span class="p">).  The restoration of natural  places encroached upon  by human intervention, such  as wetlands, also requires the expertise of a landscape designer.</span></p><p>With such  an  array  of required skills,  a  landscape designer’s  education includes a  solid  background in botany,  soil science, plant pathology, entomology, and  horticulture.  Coursework in architecture and  design software is also required for the completion of the degree. The successful design of a landscape rests on an extensive knowledge of plant growth requirements, such  as light and  shade, moisture levels,  compatibility of different  species, and  susceptibility to pathogens and  pests. For example, mosses and  ferns  will thrive in a shaded area where  fountains provide  moisture; cacti,  on the  other  hand, would not fare  well in that environment. The future  growth of the individual plants  must  be taken  into account to avoid crowding  and competition for light and  nutrients. The  appearance of the  space over  time  is also  of concern. Shapes, colors,  and  biology must  be balanced for a well-maintained and  sustainable green space. Art, architecture, and biology blend in a beautifully designed and implemented landscape.<br/><span><IMG width="298" height="224" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_485.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  14.18  <span class="s30">This campus garden was  designed by students in the  horticulture  and  landscaping department of the college.

The life cycle of bryophytes and pterophytes is characterized by the alternation of generations. The completion of the life cycle requires water, as the male gametes must swim to the female gametes. The male gametophyte releases sperm, which must swim—propelled by their flagella—to reach and fertilize the female gamete or egg. After fertilization, the zygote matures and grows into a sporophyte, which in turn will form sporangia, or &quot;spore vessels,” in which mother cells undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores. The release of spores in a suitable environment will lead to germination and a new generation of gametophytes.</p><p class="s24">The Evolution of Seed Plants</p><p>In seed plants, the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation, in which the larger and more ecologically significant generation for a species is the diploid plant. At the same time, the trend led to a reduction in the size of the gametophyte, from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic cluster of cells enclosed in the tissues of the sporophyte. Lower vascular plants, such as club mosses and ferns, are mostly homosporous (produce only one type of spore). In contrast, all seed plants, or spermatophytes, are heterosporous, forming two types of spores: megaspores (female) and microspores (male). Megaspores develop into female gametophytes that produce eggs, and microspores mature into male gametophytes that generate sperm. Because the gametophytes mature within the spores, they are not free-living, as are the gametophytes of other seedless vascular plants. Heterosporous seedless plants are seen as the evolutionary forerunners of seed plants.<br/>Seeds  and  pollen—two  adaptations  to  drought—distinguish  seed  plants  from  other  (seedless)  vascular  plants.  Both adaptations were critical to the colonization of land. Fossils place the earliest distinct seed plants at about 350 million years ago. The earliest reliable record of gymnosperms dates their appearance to the Carboniferous period (359–299 million years ago). Gymnosperms were preceded by the progymnosperms (“first naked seed plants”). This was a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers (“cone bearers”) because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues; however, they still reproduced like ferns, releasing spores to the environment. In the Mesozoic era (251–65.5 million years ago), gymnosperms dominated the landscape. Angiosperms took over by the middle of the Cretaceous period (145.5–65.5 million years ago) in the late Mesozoic era, and have since become the most abundant plant group in most terrestrial biomes.<br/>The two innovative structures of pollen and seed allowed seed plants to break their dependence on water for reproduction and development of the embryo, and to conquer dry land. The pollen grains carry the male gametes of the plant. The small haploid (1<i>n</i>) cells are encased in a protective coat that prevents desiccation (drying out) and mechanical damage. Pollen can travel far from the sporophyte that bore it, spreading the plant’s genes and avoiding competition with other plants. The seed offers the embryo protection, nourishment and a mechanism to maintain dormancy for tens or even thousands of years, allowing it to survive in a harsh environment and ensuring germination when growth conditions are optimal. Seeds allow plants to disperse the next generation through both space and time. With such evolutionary advantages, seed plants have become the most successful and familiar group of plants.</p><p class="s24">Gymnosperms</p><p class="s27">Gymnosperms <span class="p">(“naked seed”) are a diverse group of seed plants and are paraphyletic. Paraphyletic groups do not include descendants of a single common ancestor. Gymnosperm characteristics include naked seeds, separate female and male gametes, pollination by wind, and tracheids, which transport water and solutes in the vascular system.</span></p><p class="s34">Life Cycle of a Conifer</p><p>Pine trees are conifers and carry both male and female sporophylls on the same plant. Like all gymnosperms, pines are heterosporous and produce male microspores and female megaspores. In the male cones, or staminate cones, the <b>microsporocytes </b>give rise to microspores by meiosis. The microspores then develop into pollen grains. Each pollen grain contains two cells: one generative cell that will divide into two sperm, and a second cell that will become the pollen tube cell. In the spring, pine trees release large amounts of yellow pollen, which is carried by the wind. Some gametophytes will land on a female cone. The pollen tube grows from the pollen grain slowly, and the generative cell in the pollen grain divides into two sperm cells by mitosis. One of the sperm cells will finally unite its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of an egg cell in the process of fertilization.<br/>Female <b>cones</b>, or ovulate cones, contain two ovules per scale. One <b>megasporocyte </b>undergoes meiosis in each ovule. Only a single surviving haploid cell will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte that encloses an egg. On fertilization, the zygote will give rise to the embryo, which is enclosed in a seed coat of tissue from the parent plant. Fertilization and seed development is a long process in pine trees—it may take up to two years after pollination. The seed that is formed contains three generations of tissues: the seed coat that originates from the parent plant tissue, the female gametophyte that will provide nutrients, and the embryo itself. <span class="s32">Figure 14.19 </span>illustrates the life cycle of a conifer.<br/><span><IMG width="372" height="549" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_487.png"/></span></p><p class="s20">340                                                                                                                                                                                                              Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants</p><p class="s29">Figure 14.19  <span class="s30">This image  shows the lifecycle of a conifer.</span></p><p>At what stage does the diploid zygote  form?<br/>a.   when the female  cone  begins to bud from the tree b.   when the sperm nucleus and the egg nucleus fuse c.   when the seeds drop from the tree<br/>d.   when the pollen tube begins to grow<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_488.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_489.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/gymnosperm" class="s25">Watch this </a>video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/gymnosperm) <span class="p">to see the process of seed production in gymnosperms.</span></p><p class="s24">Diversity of Gymnosperms</p><p>Modern gymnosperms are classified into four major divisions and comprise about 1,000 described species.

Most are tall trees that usually bear scale-like or needle-like leaves. The thin shape of the needles and their waxy cuticle limits water loss through transpiration. Snow slides easily off needle-shaped leaves, keeping the load light and decreasing breaking of branches. These adaptations to cold and dry weather explain the predominance of conifers at high altitudes and in cold climates. Conifers include familiar evergreen trees, such as pines, spruces, firs, cedars, sequoias, and yews (<span class="s32">Figure 14.20</span>). A few species are deciduous and lose their leaves all at once in fall. The European larch and the tamarack are examples of deciduous conifers. Many coniferous trees are harvested for paper pulp and timber. The wood of conifers is more primitive than the wood of angiosperms; it contains tracheids, but no vessel elements, and is referred to as “soft wood.”<br/><span><IMG width="401" height="432" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_490.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  14.20  </span>Conifers  are  the dominant form of vegetation in cold or arid environments and  at high altitudes.

Flowers allowed plants to form cooperative evolutionary relationships with animals, in particular insects, to disperse their pollen to female gametophytes in a highly targeted way. Fruit protect the developing embryo and serve as an agent of dispersal. Different structures on fruit reflect the dispersal strategies that help with the spreading of seeds.</p><p class="s24">Flowers</p><p>Flowers are modified leaves or sporophylls organized around a central stalk. Although they vary greatly in appearance, all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, pistils, and stamens. A whorl of <b>sepals </b>(the <b>calyx</b>) is located at the base of the peduncle, or stem, and encloses the floral bud before it opens. Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. For example, the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical—this led botanists to coin the word tepal. <b>Petals </b>(collectively the <b>corolla</b>) are located inside the whorl of sepals and usually display vivid colors to attract pollinators. Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small and dull. The sexual organs are located at the center of the flower.<br/>As illustrated in <span class="s32">Figure 14.25</span>, the stigma, style, and ovary constitute the female organ, the <b>carpel </b>or <b>pistil</b>, which is also referred to as the <b>gynoecium</b>. A gynoecium may contain one or more carpels within a single flower. The megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel. A long, thin structure called a <b>style </b>leads from the sticky <b>stigma</b>, where pollen is deposited, to the <b>ovary </b>enclosed in the carpel. The ovary houses one or more ovules that will each develop into a seed upon fertilization. The male reproductive organs, the androecium or <b>stamens</b>, surround the central carpel. Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a <b>filament </b>and a sac-like structure, the <b>anther</b>, in which microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains. The filament supports the anther.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants                                                                                                                                                                                       345</p><p><span><IMG width="384" height="384" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_498.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  14.25  <span class="s30">This image  depicts the structure of a perfect  and  complete flower.

As the seed develops, the walls of the ovary also thicken and form the fruit. In botany, a fruit is a fertilized and fully grown, ripened ovary. Many foods commonly called vegetables are actually fruit. Eggplants, zucchini, string beans, and bell peppers are all technically fruit because they contain seeds and are derived from the thick ovary tissue. Acorns and winged maple keys, whose scientific name is a samara, are also fruit.<br/>Mature fruit can be described as fleshy or dry. Fleshy fruit include the familiar berries, peaches, apples, grapes, and tomatoes. Rice, wheat, and nuts are examples of dry fruit. Another distinction is that not all fruits are derived from the ovary. Some fruits are derived from separate ovaries in a single flower, such as the raspberry. Other fruits, such as the pineapple, form from clusters of flowers. Additionally, some fruits, like watermelon and orange, have rinds. Regardless of how they are formed, fruits are an agent of dispersal. The variety of shapes and characteristics reflect the mode of dispersal. The light, dry fruits of trees and dandelions are carried by the wind. Floating coconuts are transported by water. Some fruits are colored, perfumed, sweet, and nutritious to attract herbivores, which eat the fruit and disperse the tough undigested seeds in their feces. Other fruits have burs and hooks that cling to fur and hitch rides on animals.</p><p class="s24">The Life Cycle  of an Angiosperm</p><p>The adult, or sporophyte, phase is the main phase in an angiosperm’s life cycle. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are heterosporous. They produce microspores, which develop into pollen grains (the male gametophytes), and megaspores, which form an ovule containing the female gametophytes. Inside the anthers’ microsporangia (<span class="s32">Figure 14.26</span>), male microsporocytes divide by meiosis, generating haploid microspores that undergo mitosis and give rise to pollen grains. Each pollen grain contains two cells: one generative cell that will divide into two sperm, and a second cell that will become the pollen tube cell.</p><p class="s20">346                                                                                                                                                                                                              Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants</p><p class="s29">Figure  14.26   <span class="s30">This  diagram shows  the  lifecycle  of  an  angiosperm.

If  it lacked  a microsporangium, what type of gamete would not form?<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="759" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_499.png"/></span><br/>In the ovules, the female gametophyte is produced when a megasporocyte undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid megaspores. One of these is larger than the others and undergoes mitosis to form the female gametophyte or embryo sac. Three mitotic divisions produce eight nuclei in seven cells. The egg and two cells move to one end of the embryo sac (gametophyte) and three cells move to the other end. Two of the nuclei remain in a single cell and fuse to form a 2<i>n </i>nucleus; this cell moves to the center of the embryo sac.<br/>When a pollen grain reaches the stigma, a pollen tube extends from the grain, grows down the style, and enters through an opening in the integuments of the ovule. The two sperm cells are deposited in the embryo sac.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants                                                                                                                                                                                       347</p><p>What occurs next is called a double fertilization event (<span class="s32">Figure 14.27</span>) and is unique to angiosperms. One sperm and the egg combine, forming a diploid zygote—the future embryo. The other sperm fuses with the diploid nucleus in the center of the embryo sac, forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm: a tissue that serves as a food reserve. The zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle, or small root, and one or two leaf-like organs called <b>cotyledons</b>. Seed food reserves are stored outside the embryo, and the cotyledons serve as conduits to transmit the broken-down food reserves to the developing embryo. The seed consists of a toughened layer of integuments forming the coat, the endosperm with food reserves and, at the center, the well-protected embryo.<br/><span><IMG width="451" height="143" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_500.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 14.27  <span class="s30">Double fertilization occurs only in angiosperms.

These are known as “perfect” flowers because they contain both types of sex organs (<span class="s32">Figure 14.25</span>. Biochemical and anatomical barriers to self-pollination promote cross-pollination. Self-pollination is a severe form of inbreeding, and can increase the number of genetic defects in offspring.<br/>A plant may have perfect flowers, and thus have both genders in each flower; or, it may have imperfect flowers of both kinds on one plant (<span class="s32">Figure 14.28</span>). In each case, such species are called monoecious plants, meaning “one house.” Some botanists refer to plants with perfect flowers simply as hermaphroditic. Some plants are dioecious, meaning “two houses,” and have male and female flowers (“imperfect flowers”) on different plants. In these species, cross-pollination occurs all the time.<br/><span><IMG width="445" height="324" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_501.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  14.28  <span class="s30">Monoecious plants  have  both male  and  female  reproductive structures on the same flower or plant.

Modern angiosperms appear to be a monophyletic group, which means that they originate from a single ancestor. Flowering plants are divided into two major groups, according to the structure of the cotyledons, the pollen grains, and other features: <b>monocots</b>, which include grasses and lilies, and <b>eudicots</b></p><p class="s20">348                                                                                                                                                                                                              Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants</p><p>or <b>dicots</b>, a polyphyletic group. <b>Basal angiosperms </b>are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation into monocots and eudicots because they exhibit traits from both groups. They are categorized separately in many classification schemes, and correspond to a grouping known as the Magnoliidae. The Magnoliidae group is comprised of magnolia trees, laurels, water lilies, and the pepper family.</p><p class="s34">Basal Angiosperms</p><p>The Magnoliidae are represented by the magnolias: tall trees that bear large, fragrant flowers with many parts, and are considered archaic (<span class="s32">Figure 14.29</span><b>d</b>). Laurel trees produce fragrant leaves and small inconspicuous flowers. The Laurales are small trees and shrubs that grow mostly in warmer climates. Familiar plants in this group include the bay laurel, cinnamon, spice bush (<span class="s32">Figure 14.29</span><b>a</b>), and the avocado tree. The Nymphaeales are comprised of the water lilies, lotus (<span class="s32">Figure 14.29</span><b>c</b>), and similar plants. All species of the Nymphaeales thrive in freshwater biomes, and have leaves that float on the water surface or grow underwater. Water lilies are particularly prized by gardeners, and have graced ponds and pools since antiquity. The Piperales are a group of herbs, shrubs, and small trees that grow in tropical climates. They have small flowers without petals that are tightly arranged in long spikes. Many species are the source of prized fragrances or spices; for example, the berries of <i>Piper nigrum </i>(<span class="s32">Figure 14.29</span><b>b</b>) are the familiar black pepper that is used to flavor many dishes.<br/><span><IMG width="351" height="435" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_502.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  14.29  </span>The (a) southern spicebush belongs to the <i>Laurales</i>,  the same family as cinnamon and  bay laurel.

Veins run parallel to the length of the leaves, and flower parts are arranged in a three- or six-fold symmetry. The pollen from the first angiosperms was monosulcate (containing a single furrow or pore through the outer layer). This feature is still seen in the modern monocots. True woody tissue is rarely found in monocots, and the vascular tissue of the stem is not arranged in any particular pattern. The root system is mostly adventitious (unusually positioned) with no major taproot. The monocots include familiar plants such as the true lilies (not to be confused with the water lilies), orchids, grasses, and palms.

Eudicots can be <b>herbaceous </b>(like dandelions or violets), or produce woody tissues. Most eudicots produce pollen that is trisulcate or triporate, with three furrows or pores. The root system is usually anchored by one main root developed from the embryonic radicle. Eudicots comprise two-thirds of all flowering plants.

Adaptations to life on land include vascular tissues, roots, leaves, waxy cuticles, and a tough outer layer that protects the spores. Land plants include nonvascular plants and vascular plants. Vascular plants, which include seedless plants and plants with seeds, have apical meristems, and embryos with nutritional stores. All land plants share the following characteristics: alternation of generations, with the haploid plant called a gametophyte and the diploid plant called a sporophyte; formation of haploid spores in a sporangium; and formation of gametes in a gametangium.</p><p class="s52">14.2 Seedless Plants</p><p>Seedless nonvascular plants are small. The dominant stage of the life cycle is the gametophyte. Without a vascular system and roots, they absorb water and nutrients through all of their exposed surfaces. There are three main groups: the liverworts, the hornworts, and the mosses. They are collectively known as bryophytes.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 14 | Diversity of Plants                                                                                                                                                                                       353</p><p>Vascular systems consist of xylem tissue, which transports water and minerals, and phloem tissue, which transports sugars and proteins. With the vascular system, there appeared leaves—large photosynthetic organs—and roots to absorb water from the ground. The seedless vascular plants include club mosses, which are the most primitive; whisk ferns, which lost leaves and roots by reductive evolution; horsetails, and ferns.</p><p class="s52">14.3 Seed Plants: Gymnosperms</p><p>Gymnosperms are heterosporous seed plants that produce naked seeds. They appeared in the Carboniferous period (359–299 million years ago) and were the dominant plant life during the Mesozoic era (251–65.5 million years ago). Modern-day gymnosperms belong to four divisions. The division Coniferophyta—the conifers—are the predominant woody plants at high altitudes and latitudes. Cycads resemble palm trees and grow in tropical climates. <i>Gingko biloba </i>is the only species of the division Gingkophyta. The last division, the Gnetophytes, is a diverse group of species that produce vessel elements in their wood.</p><p class="s52">14.4 Seed Plants: Angiosperms</p><p>Angiosperms are the dominant form of plant life in most terrestrial ecosystems, comprising about 90 percent of all plant species. Most crop and ornamental plants are angiosperms. Their success results, in part, from two innovative structures: the flower and the fruit. Flowers are derived evolutionarily from modified leaves. The main parts of a flower are the sepals and petals, which protect the reproductive parts: the stamens and the carpels. The stamens produce the male gametes, which are pollen grains. The carpels contain the female gametes, which are the eggs inside ovaries. The walls of the ovary thicken after fertilization, ripening into fruit that can facilitate seed dispersal.<br/>Angiosperms’ life cycles are dominated by the sporophyte stage. Double fertilization is an event unique to angiosperms. The flowering plants are divided into two main groups—the monocots and eudicots—according to the number of cotyledons in the seedlings. Basal angiosperms belong to a lineage older than monocots and eudicots.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 14.19 </span><span class="p">At what stage does the diploid zygote form?</span></p><p>a.

Yet scientists have recognized a set of common characteristics shared by all animals, including sponges, jellyfish, sea urchins, and humans.<br/>The kingdom Animalia is a group of multicellular Eukarya. Animal evolution began in the ocean over 600 million years ago, with tiny creatures that probably do not resemble any living organism today. Since then, animals have evolved into a highly diverse kingdom. Although over one million currently living species of animals have been identified, scientists are <span class="s55">[1]</span><br/>continually discovering more species. The number of described living animal species is estimated to be about 1.4 million,<br/>and there may be as many as 6.8 million.<br/>Understanding and classifying the variety of living species helps us to better understand how to conserve and benefit from this diversity. The animal classification system characterizes animals based on their anatomy, features of embryological development, and genetic makeup. Scientists are faced with the task of classifying animals within a system of taxonomy that reflects their evolutionary history. Additionally, they must identify traits that are common to all animals as well as traits that can be used to distinguish among related groups of animals. However, animals vary in the complexity of their organization<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_509.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">1.   “Number of Living Species in Australia and the World,” A.D.

All animals are eukaryotic, multicellular organisms, and almost all animals have specialized tissues. Most animals are motile, at least during certain life stages. Animals require a source of food to grow and develop. All animals are heterotrophic, ingesting living or dead organic matter. This form of obtaining energy distinguishes them from autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, which make their own nutrients through photosynthesis and from fungi that digest their food externally. Animals may be carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, or parasites (<span class="s32">Figure 15.2</span>). Most animals reproduce sexually: The offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined body plan, unlike plants, for example, in which the exact shape of the body is indeterminate. The <b>body plan </b>refers to the shape of an animal.<br/><span><IMG width="530" height="254" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_511.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  15.2 </span>All animals that derive  energy from food are  heterotrophs.

As multicellular organisms, most animals develop specialized cells that group together into tissues with specialized functions. A tissue is a collection of similar cells that had a common embryonic origin. There are four main types of animal tissues: nervous, muscle, connective, and epithelial. Nervous tissue contains neurons, or nerve cells, which transmit nerve impulses. Muscle tissue contracts to cause all types of body movement from locomotion of the organism to movements within the body itself. Animals also have specialized connective tissues that provide many functions, including transport and structural support. Examples of connective tissues include blood and bone. Connective tissue is comprised of cells separated by extracellular material made of organic and inorganic materials, such as the protein and mineral deposits of bone. Epithelial tissue covers the internal and external surfaces of organs inside the animal body and the external surface of the body of the organism.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals                                                                                                                                                                                                           357</p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_512.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_513.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/saving_life2" class="s25">View this </a>video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/saving_life2) <span class="p">to watch a presentation by biologist E.O. Wilson on the importance of animal diversity.</span></p><p class="s24">Animal Reproduction and Development</p><p>Most animals have diploid body (somatic) cells and a small number of haploid reproductive (gamete) cells produced through meiosis. Some exceptions exist: For example, in bees, wasps, and ants, the male is haploid because it develops from an unfertilized egg. Most animals undergo sexual reproduction, while many also have mechanisms of asexual reproduction.</p><p class="s34">Sexual Reproduction and Embryonic Development</p><p>Almost all animal species are capable of reproducing sexually; for many, this is the only mode of reproduction possible. This distinguishes animals from fungi, protists, and bacteria, where asexual reproduction is common or exclusive. During sexual reproduction, the male and female gametes of a species combine in a process called fertilization. Typically, the small, motile male sperm travels to the much larger, sessile female egg. Sperm form is diverse and includes cells with flagella or amoeboid cells to facilitate motility. Fertilization and fusion of the gamete nuclei produce a zygote. Fertilization may be internal, especially in land animals, or external, as is common in many aquatic species.<br/>After fertilization, a developmental sequence ensues as cells divide and differentiate. Many of the events in development are shared in groups of related animal species, and these events are one of the main ways scientists classify high-level groups of animals. During development, animal cells specialize and form tissues, determining their future morphology and physiology. In many animals, such as mammals, the young resemble the adult. Other animals, such as some insects and amphibians, undergo complete metamorphosis in which individuals enter one or more larval stages. For these animals, the young and the adult have different diets and sometimes habitats. In other species, a process of incomplete metamorphosis occurs in which the young somewhat resemble the adults and go through a series of stages separated by molts (shedding of the skin) until they reach the final adult form.</p><p class="s34">Asexual Reproduction</p><p>Asexual reproduction, unlike sexual reproduction, produces offspring genetically identical to each other and to the parent. A number of animal species—especially those without backbones, but even some fish, amphibians, and reptiles—are capable of asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction, except for occasional identical twinning, is absent in birds and mammals. The most common forms of asexual reproduction for stationary aquatic animals include budding and fragmentation, in which part of a parent individual can separate and grow into a new individual. In contrast, a form of asexual reproduction found in certain invertebrates and rare vertebrates is called parthenogenesis (or “virgin beginning”), in which unfertilized eggs develop into new offspring.</p><p class="s24">Classification Features of Animals</p><p>Animals are classified according to morphological and developmental characteristics, such as a body plan. With the exception of sponges, the animal body plan is symmetrical. This means that their distribution of body parts is balanced along an axis. Additional characteristics that contribute to animal classification include the number of tissue layers formed during development, the presence or absence of an internal body cavity, and other features of embryological development.</p><p class="s20">358                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p class="s29">Figure 15.3 <span class="s30">The phylogenetic tree  of animals is based on morphological, fossil, and genetic evidence.</span></p><p>Which of the following statements is false?<br/>a.

This epithelial- lined cavity is a space, usually filled with fluid, which lies between the digestive system and the body wall. It houses organs such as the kidneys and spleen, and contains the circulatory system. Triploblasts that do not develop a coelom are called <b>acoelomates</b>, and their mesoderm region is completely filled with tissue, although they have a gut cavity. Examples of acoelomates include the flatworms. Animals with a true coelom are called <b>eucoelomates </b>(or coelomates) (<span class="s32">Figure 15.6</span>). A true coelom arises entirely within the mesoderm germ layer. Animals such as earthworms, snails, insects, starfish, and vertebrates are all eucoelomates. A third group of triploblasts has a body cavity that is derived partly from mesoderm and partly from endoderm tissue. These animals are called <b>pseudocoelomates</b>. Roundworms are examples of pseudocoelomates. New data on the relationships of pseudocoelomates suggest that these phyla are not closely related and so the evolution of the pseudocoelom must have occurred more than once (<span class="s32">Figure 15.3</span>). True coelomates can be further characterized based on features of their early embryological development.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="349" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_519.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.6 <span class="s30">Triploblasts may be acoelomates, eucoelomates, or pseudocoelomates.

Lacking a true digestive system, sponges depend on the intracellular digestive processes of their choanocytes for their energy intake. The limit of this type of digestion is that food particles must be smaller than individual cells. Gas exchange, circulation, and excretion occur by diffusion between cells and the water.<br/>Sponges reproduce both sexually and asexually. Asexual reproduction is either by <b>fragmentation </b>(in which a piece of the sponge breaks off and develops into a new individual), or <b>budding </b>(an outgrowth from the parent that eventually detaches). A type of asexual reproduction found only in freshwater sponges occurs through the formation of <b>gemmules</b>, clusters of cells surrounded by a tough outer layer. Gemmules survive hostile environments and can attach to a substrate and grow into a new sponge.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_524.jpg"/></span><br/>Sponges are <b>monoecious </b>(or hermaphroditic), meaning one individual can produce both eggs and sperm. Sponges may be sequentially hermaphroditic, producing eggs first and sperm later. Eggs arise from amoebocytes and are retained within the spongocoel, whereas sperm arise from choanocytes and are ejected through the osculum. Sperm carried by water currents fertilize the eggs of other sponges. Early larval development occurs within the sponge, and free-swimming larvae are then released through the osculum. This is the only time that sponges exhibit mobility. Sponges are sessile as adults and spend their lives attached to a fixed substrate.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_525.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sponge_feed" class="s25">Watch this </a>video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sponge_feed) <span class="p">that demonstrates the feeding of sponges.</span></p><p class="s24">Cnidarians</p><p>The phylum <b>Cnidaria </b>includes animals that show radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic.

Nematocysts contain coiled threads that may bear barbs. The outer wall of the cell has a hairlike projection that is sensitive to touch. When touched, the cells fire the toxin-containing coiled threads that can penetrate and stun the predator or prey (see <span class="s32">Figure 15.10</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="425" height="332" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_526.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.10  <span class="s30">Animals  from  the  phylum  Cnidaria   have   stinging  cells  called  cnidocytes.

Medusae are motile, with the mouth and tentacles hanging from the bell-shaped body. In other cnidarians, both a polyp and medusa form exist, and the life cycle alternates between these forms.<br/><span><IMG width="381" height="263" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_527.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.11  <span class="s30">Cnidarians have  two distinct body plans, the (a) medusa and the (b) polyp.

The function of the nerve cells is to carry signals from sensory cells and to contractile cells. Groups of cells in the nerve net form nerve cords that may be essential for more rapid transmission. Cnidarians perform <b>extracellular digestion</b>, with digestion completed by intracellular digestive processes. Food is taken into the <b>gastrovascular cavity</b>, enzymes are secreted into the cavity, and the cells lining the cavity absorb the nutrient products of the extracellular digestive process. The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus (an incomplete digestive system). Like the sponges, Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogenous wastes by diffusion between cells in the epidermis and gastrodermis with water.</p><p class="s34">Cnidarian Diversity</p><p>The phylum Cnidaria contains about 10,000 described species divided into four classes: Anthozoa, Scyphozoa, Cubozoa, and Hydrozoa.<br/>The class Anthozoa includes all cnidarians that exhibit a sessile polyp body plan only; in other words, there is no medusa stage within their life cycle. Examples include sea anemones, sea pens, and corals, with an estimated number of 6,100 described species. Sea anemones are usually brightly colored and can attain a size of 1.8 to 10 cm in diameter. These animals are usually cylindrical in shape and are attached to a substrate. A mouth opening is surrounded by tentacles bearing cnidocytes (<span class="s32">Figure 15.12</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="344" height="258" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_528.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.12  <span class="s30">Sea anemones are cnidarians of class Anthozoa.

The medusa is the dominant stage in the life cycle, although there is also a polyp stage. Species range from 2 cm in length to the largest scyphozoan species, <i>Cyanea capillata</i>, at 2 m across.

Cubozoans are anatomically similar to the jellyfish. A prominent difference between the two classes is the arrangement of tentacles. Cubozoans have muscular pads called pedalia at the corners of the square bell canopy, with one or more tentacles attached to each pedalium. In some cases, the digestive system may extend into the pedalia. Cubozoans typically exist in a polyp form that develops from a larva. The polyps may bud to form more polyps and then transform into the medusoid forms.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_533.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/box_jellyfish" class="s25">Watch this </a>video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/box_jellyfish) <span class="p">to learn more about the deadly toxins of the box jellyfish.</span></p><p>Hydrozoa includes nearly 3,500 species,</p><p class="s55">[2]</p><p>most of which are marine. Most species in this class have both polyp and<br/>medusa forms in their life cycle. Many hydrozoans form colonies composed of branches of specialized polyps that share a gastrovascular cavity. Colonies may also be free-floating and contain both medusa and polyp individuals in the colony, as in the Portuguese Man O’War (<i>Physalia</i>) or By-the-Wind Sailor (<i>Velella</i>). Other species are solitary polyps or solitary medusae. The characteristic shared by all of these species is that their gonads are derived from epidermal tissue, whereas in all other cnidarians, they are derived from gastrodermal tissue (<span class="s32">Figure 15.14</span><b>ab</b>).<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_534.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">2.   “The Hydrozoa Directory,” Peter Schuchert, Muséum Genève, last updated November 2012, http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/hydrozoa- directory.htm.</p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals                                                                                                                                                                                                           367</p><p><span><IMG width="451" height="299" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_535.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.14  <span class="s30">A (a) box jelly is an example from class Cubozoa.

These phyla are also bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section will divide them into right and left sides that are mirror images of each other. Associated with bilateralism is the beginning of cephalization, the evolution of a concentration of nervous tissues and sensory organs in the head of the organism, which is where the organism first encounters its environment.<br/>The flatworms are acoelomate organisms that include free-living and parasitic forms. The nematodes, or roundworms, possess a pseudocoelom and consist of both free-living and parasitic forms. Finally, the arthropods, one of the most successful taxonomic groups on the planet, are coelomate organisms with a hard exoskeleton and jointed appendages. The nematodes and the arthropods belong to a clade with a common ancestor, called Ecdysozoa. The name comes from the word <i>ecdysis</i>, which refers to the periodic shedding, or molting, of the exoskeleton. The ecdysozoan phyla have a hard cuticle covering their bodies that must be periodically shed and replaced for them to increase in size.</p><p class="s24">Flatworms</p><p>The relationships among flatworms, or phylum Platyhelminthes, is being revised and the description here will follow the traditional groupings. Most flatworms are parasitic, including important parasites of humans. Flatworms have three embryonic germ layers that give rise to surfaces covering tissues, internal tissues, and the lining of the digestive system. The epidermal tissue is a single layer of cells or a layer of fused cells covering a layer of circular muscle above a layer of longitudinal muscle. The mesodermal tissues include support cells and secretory cells that secrete mucus and other materials to the surface. The flatworms are acoelomate, so their bodies contain no cavities or spaces between the outer surface and the inner digestive tract.</p><p class="s34">Physiological Processes of Flatworms</p><p>Free-living species of flatworms are predators or scavengers, whereas parasitic forms feed from the tissues of their hosts. Most flatworms have an incomplete digestive system with an opening, the “mouth,” that is also used to expel digestive</p><p class="s20">368                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p>system wastes. Some species also have an anal opening. The gut may be a simple sac or highly branched. Digestion is extracellular, with enzymes secreted into the space by cells lining the tract, and digested materials taken into the same cells by phagocytosis. One group, the cestodes, does not have a digestive system, because their parasitic lifestyle and the environment in which they live (suspended within the digestive cavity of their host) allows them to absorb nutrients directly across their body wall. Flatworms have an excretory system with a network of tubules throughout the body that open to the environment and nearby flame cells, whose cilia beat to direct waste fluids concentrated in the tubules out of the body. The system is responsible for regulation of dissolved salts and excretion of nitrogenous wastes. The nervous system consists of a pair of nerve cords running the length of the body with connections between them and a large ganglion or concentration of nerve cells at the anterior end of the worm; here, there may also be a concentration of photosensory and chemosensory cells (<span class="s32">Figure 15.15</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="503" height="302" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_537.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.15 <span class="s30">This planarian is a free-living flatworm that has  an incomplete digestive system, an excretory system with a network  of tubules throughout the  body,  and  a nervous system made up of nerve  cords  running  the  length  of the body with a concentration of nerves and photosensory and chemosensory cells at the anterior  end.</span></p><p>Since there is no circulatory or respiratory system, gas and nutrient exchange is dependent on diffusion and intercellular junctions. This necessarily limits the thickness of the body in these organisms, constraining them to be “flat” worms. Most flatworm species are monoecious (hermaphroditic, possessing both sets of sex organs), and fertilization is typically internal. Asexual reproduction is common in some groups in which an entire organism can be regenerated from just a part of itself.</p><p class="s34">Diversity of Flatworms</p><p>Flatworms are traditionally divided into four classes: Turbellaria, Monogenea, Trematoda, and Cestoda (<span class="s32">Figure 15.16</span>). The turbellarians include mainly free-living marine species, although some species live in freshwater or moist terrestrial environments. The simple planarians found in freshwater ponds and aquaria are examples. The epidermal layer of the underside of turbellarians is ciliated, and this helps them move. Some turbellarians are capable of remarkable feats of regeneration in which they may regrow the body, even from a small fragment.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals                                                                                                                                                                                                           369</p><p><span><IMG width="451" height="387" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_538.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  15.16  </span>Phylum  Platyhelminthes is divided  into four classes: (a) Bedford’s Flatworm  (<i>Pseudobiceros bedfordi</i>) and the (b) planarian belong  to class Turbellaria;  (c) the Trematoda class includes about  20,000 species, most of which are  parasitic; (d) class Cestoda includes tapeworms such  as this <i>Taenia  saginata</i>; and  the parasitic class Monogenea (not shown).

They have only one host during their life, typically of just one species. The worms may produce enzymes that digest the host tissues or graze on surface mucus and skin particles. Most monogeneans are hermaphroditic, but the sperm develop first, and it is typical for them to mate between individuals and not to self-fertilize.<br/>The trematodes, or flukes, are internal parasites of mollusks and many other groups, including humans. Trematodes have complex life cycles that involve a primary host in which sexual reproduction occurs and one or more secondary hosts in which asexual reproduction occurs. The primary host is almost always a mollusk. Trematodes are responsible for serious human diseases including schistosomiasis, caused by a blood fluke (<i>Schistosoma</i>). The disease infects an estimated 200 million people in the tropics and leads to organ damage and chronic symptoms including fatigue. Infection occurs when a human enters the water, and a larva, released from the primary snail host, locates and penetrates the skin. The parasite infects various organs in the body and feeds on red blood cells before reproducing. Many of the eggs are released in feces and find their way into a waterway where they are able to reinfect the primary snail host.<br/>The cestodes, or tapeworms, are also internal parasites, mainly of vertebrates. Tapeworms live in the intestinal tract of the primary host and remain fixed using a sucker on the anterior end, or scolex, of the tapeworm body. The remaining body of the tapeworm is made up of a long series of units called proglottids, each of which may contain an excretory system with flame cells, but will contain reproductive structures, both male and female. Tapeworms do not have a digestive system, they absorb nutrients from the food matter passing them in the host’s intestine. Proglottids are produced at the scolex and are pushed to the end of the tapeworm as new proglottids form, at which point, they are “mature” and all structures except fertilized eggs have degenerated. Most reproduction occurs by cross-fertilization. The proglottid detaches and is released in the feces of the host. The fertilized eggs are eaten by an intermediate host. The juvenile worms emerge and infect the intermediate host, taking up residence, usually in muscle tissue. When the muscle tissue is eaten by the primary host, the cycle is completed. There are several tapeworm parasites of humans that are acquired by eating uncooked or poorly cooked pork, beef, and fish.</p><p class="s20">370                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p class="s24">Nematodes</p><p>The phylum <b>Nematoda</b>, or roundworms, includes more than 28,000 species with an estimated 16,000 parasitic species.

There may also be a sharp stylet that can protrude from the mouth to stab prey or pierce plant or animal cells.

As members of Ecdysozoa, arthropods also have an exoskeleton made principally of chitin. Arthropoda is the largest phylum in the animal world in terms of numbers of species, and insects form the single largest group within this phylum.

The phylum is further classified into five subphyla: Trilobitomorpha (trilobites), Hexapoda (insects and relatives), Myriapoda (millipedes, centipedes, and relatives), Crustacea (crabs, lobsters, crayfish, isopods, barnacles, and some zooplankton), and Chelicerata (horseshoe crabs, arachnids, scorpions, and daddy longlegs). Trilobites are an extinct group of arthropods found from the Cambrian period (540–490 million years ago) until they became extinct in the Permian (300–251 million years ago) that are probably most closely related to the Chelicerata. The 17,000 described species have been identified from fossils (<span class="s32">Figure 15.18</span>).<br/>The Hexapoda have six legs (three pairs) as their name suggests. Hexapod segments are fused into a head, thorax, and abdomen (<span class="s32">Figure 15.20</span>). The thorax bears the wings and three pairs of legs. The insects we encounter on a daily basis—such as ants, cockroaches, butterflies, and bees—are examples of Hexapoda.<br/><span><IMG width="376" height="214" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_544.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.20  <span class="s30">In this basic  anatomy of a hexapod, note  that  insects have  a developed digestive system (yellow), a respiratory system (blue), a circulatory system (red), and a nervous system (purple).</span></p><p>Subphylum Myriapoda includes arthropods with legs that may vary in number from 10 to 750.

The number of described crustacean species stands at about 47,000.<br/>Although the basic body plan in crustaceans is similar to the Hexapoda—head, thorax, and abdomen—the head and thorax may be fused in some species to form a <b>cephalothorax</b>, which is covered by a plate called the carapace (<span class="s32">Figure 15.22</span>). The exoskeleton of many species is also infused with calcium carbonate, which makes it even stronger than in other arthropods. Crustaceans have an open circulatory system in which blood is pumped into the hemocoel by the dorsal heart. Most crustaceans typically have separate sexes, but some, like barnacles, may be hermaphroditic. Serial hermaphroditism, in which the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova, is also found in some crustacean species. Larval stages are seen in the early development of many crustaceans. Most crustaceans are carnivorous, but detritivores and filter feeders are also common.<br/><span><IMG width="503" height="115" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_546.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.22  <span class="s30">The crayfish is an example of a crustacean.

As in other members of Arthropoda, chelicerates also utilize an open circulatory system, with a tube-like heart that pumps blood into the large hemocoel that bathes the internal organs.

They have a variety of forms, ranging from large predatory squid and octopus, some of which show a high degree of intelligence, to small grazing forms with elaborately sculpted and colored shells. The annelids traditionally include the oligochaetes, which include the earthworms and leeches, the polychaetes, which are a marine group, and two other smaller classes.<br/>The phyla Mollusca and Annelida belong to a clade called the <b>Lophotrochozoa</b>, which also includes the phylum Nemertea, or ribbon worms (<span class="s32">Figure 15.3</span>). They are distinct from the Ecdysozoa (nematodes and arthropods) based on evidence from analysis of their DNA, which has changed our views of the relationships among invertebrates.</p><p class="s24">Phylum  Mollusca</p><p><b>Mollusca </b>is the predominant phylum in marine environments, where it is estimated that 23 percent of all known marine species belong to this phylum. It is the second most diverse phylum of animals with over 75,000 described species. The name “mollusca” signifies a soft body, as the earliest descriptions of mollusks came from observations of unshelled, soft- bodied cuttlefish (squid relatives). Although mollusk body forms vary, they share key characteristics, such as a ventral, muscular foot that is typically used for locomotion; the visceral mass, which contains most of the internal organs of the animal; and a dorsal mantle, which is a flap of tissue over the visceral mass that creates a space called the mantle cavity. The mantle may or may not secrete a shell of calcium carbonate. In addition, many mollusks have a scraping structure at the mouth, called a <b>radula </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 15.24</span>).<br/>The muscular foot varies in shape and function, depending on the type of mollusk (described below in the section on mollusk diversity). It is a retractable as well as extendable organ, used for locomotion and anchorage.

The mantle cavity, formed inside the <b>mantle</b>, develops independently of the coelomic cavity. It is a multi-purpose space, housing the gills, the anus, organs for sensing food particles in the water, and an outlet for gametes. Most mollusks have an open circulatory system with a heart that circulates the hemolymph in open spaces around the organs. The octopuses and squid are an exception to this and have a closed circulatory system with two hearts that move blood through the gills and a third, systemic heart that pumps blood through the rest of the body.</p><p class="s29">Figure  15.24  <span class="s30">There  are  many  species and variations of mollusks;  the gastropod mollusk anatomy is shown  here, which shares many characteristics common with other  groups.</span></p><p>Which of the following statements about  the anatomy of a mollusk is false?<br/>a.

These animals lack a shell but have aragonite spicules on their skin. Members of class Monoplacophora (“bearing one plate”) have a single, cap-like shell enclosing the body. The monoplacophorans were believed extinct and only known as fossils until the discovery of <i>Neopilina galatheae </i>in 1952. Today, scientists have identified nearly two dozen living species.<br/>Animals in the class Polyplacophora (“bearing many plates”) are commonly known as “chitons” and bear an armor-like, eight-plated shell (<span class="s32">Figure 15.25</span>). These animals have a broad, ventral foot that is adapted for attachment to rocks and a mantle that extends beyond the shell in the form of a girdle.

They feed by filtering particles from water and a radula is absent. They exchange gases using a pair of ctenidia, and excretion and osmoregulation are carried out by a pair of nephridia. In some species, the posterior edges of the mantle may fuse to form two siphons that inhale and exhale water. Some bivalves like oysters and mussels have the unique ability to secrete and deposit a calcareous <b>nacre </b>or “mother of pearl” around foreign particles that enter the mantle cavity.

Most gastropods bear a head with tentacles that support eyes. A complex radula is used to scrape food particles from the substrate. The mantle cavity encloses the ctenidia as well as a pair of nephridia.<br/>The class Cephalopoda (“head foot” animals) includes octopuses, squids, cuttlefish, and nautilus. Cephalopods include shelled and reduced-shell groups. They display vivid coloration, typically seen in squids and octopuses, which is used for camouflage. The ability of some octopuses to rapidly adjust their colors to mimic a background pattern or to startle a predator is one of the more awe-inspiring feats of these animals. All animals in this class are predators and have beak- like jaws. All cephalopods have a well-developed nervous system, complex eyes, and a closed circulatory system. The foot is lobed and developed into tentacles and a funnel, which is used for locomotion. Suckers are present on the tentacles in octopuses and squid. Ctenidia are enclosed in a large mantle cavity and are serviced by large blood vessels, each with its own heart.<br/>Cephalopods (<span class="s32">Figure 15.27</span>) are able to move quickly via jet propulsion by contracting the mantle cavity to forcefully eject a stream of water. Cephalopods have separate sexes, and the females of some species care for the eggs for an extended period of time. Although the shell is much reduced and internal in squid and cuttlefish, and absent altogether in octopus, nautilus live inside a spiral, multi-chambered shell that is filled with gas or water to regulate buoyancy.</p><p class="s20">378                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p><span><IMG width="451" height="388" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_557.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.27  <span class="s30">The (a) nautilus, (b) giant cuttlefish, (c) reef squid,  and (d) blue-ring octopus are all members of the class Cephalopoda.

Like mollusks, annelids exhibit protostomic development.</span></p><p>Annelids are bilaterally symmetrical and have a worm-like appearance. Their particular segmented body plan results in repetition of internal and external features in each body segment. This type of body plan is called <b>metamerism</b>. The evolutionary benefit of such a body plan is thought to be the capacity it allows for the evolution of independent modifications in different segments that perform different functions. The overall body can then be divided into head, body, and tail.</p><p class="s24">Physiological Processes of Annelida</p><p>The skin of annelids is protected by a cuticle that is thinner than the cuticle of the ecdysozoans and does not need to be molted for growth. Chitinous hairlike extensions, anchored in the skin and projecting from the cuticle, called <b>chaetae</b>, are present in every segment in most groups. The chaetae are a defining character of annelids. Polychaete worms have paired, unjointed limbs called parapodia on each segment used for locomotion and breathing. Beneath the cuticle there are two layers of muscle, one running around its circumference (circular) and one running the length of the worm (longitudinal). Annelids have a true coelom in which organs are distributed and bathed in coelomic fluid. Annelids possess a well- developed complete digestive system with specialized organs: mouth, muscular pharynx, esophagus, and crop. A cross- sectional view of a body segment of an earthworm is shown in <span class="s32">Figure 15.29</span>; each segment is limited by a membrane that divides the body cavity into compartments.<br/>Annelids have a closed circulatory system with muscular pumping “hearts” in the anterior segments, dorsal and ventral blood vessels that run the length of the body with connections in each segment, and capillaries that service individual tissues. Gas exchange occurs across the moist body surface. Excretion is carried out by pairs of primitive “kidneys” called metanephridia that consist of a convoluted tubule and an open, ciliated funnel present in every segment. Annelids have a well-developed nervous system with two ventral nerve cords and a nerve ring of fused ganglia present around the pharynx.<br/><span><IMG width="382" height="244" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_559.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.29  <span class="s30">In this schematic showing  the basic  anatomy of annelids, the digestive system is indicated in green, the nervous system is indicated in yellow, and the circulatory system is indicated in red.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_560.jpg"/></span><br/>Annelids may be either monoecious with permanent gonads (as in earthworms and leeches) or dioecious with temporary or seasonal gonads (as in polychaetes).<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_561.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/annelid2" class="s25">This </a>video and animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/annelid2) <span class="p">provides a close-up look at annelid anatomy.</span></p><p class="s20">380                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p class="s24">Annelid  Diversity</p><p>Phylum Annelida includes the classes Polychaeta and Clitellata (<span class="s32">Figure 15.30</span>); the latter contains subclasses Oligochaeta, Hirudinoidea, and Branchiobdellida.<br/>Earthworms are the most abundant members of the subclass Oligochaeta, distinguished by the presence of the <b>clitellum</b>, a ring structure in the skin that secretes mucus to bind mating individuals and forms a protective cocoon for the eggs. They also have a few, reduced chaetae (oligo- = “few”; -chaetae = “hairs”). The number and size of chaetae is greatly diminished in oligochaetes as compared to the polychaetes (poly- = “many”; -chaetae = “hairs”). The chaetae of polychaetes are also arranged within fleshy, flat, paired appendages on each segment called parapodia.<br/>The  subclass  Hirudinoidea  includes  leeches.  Significant  differences  between  leeches  and  other  annelids  include  the development of suckers at the anterior and posterior ends, and the absence of chaetae. Additionally, the segmentation of the body wall may not correspond to internal segmentation of the coelomic cavity. This adaptation may allow leeches to swell when ingesting blood from host vertebrates. The subclass Branchiobdellida includes about 150 species that show similarity to leeches as well as oligochaetes. All species are obligate symbionts, meaning that they can only survive associated with their host, mainly with freshwater crayfish. They feed on the algae that grows on the carapace of the crayfish.<br/><span><IMG width="503" height="191" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_562.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.30  <span class="s30">The (a) earthworm and (b) leech  are both annelids.

The system consists of a central ring canal and radial canals extending along each arm. Water circulates through these structures allowing for gas, nutrient, and waste exchange. A structure on top of the body, called the <b>madreporite</b>, regulates the amount of water in the water vascular system. “Tube feet,” which protrude through openings in the endoskeleton, may be expanded or contracted using the hydrostatic pressure in the system. The system allows for slow movement, but a great deal of power, as witnessed when the tube feet latch on to opposite halves of a bivalve mollusk, like a clam, and slowly, but surely pull the shells apart, exposing the flesh within.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="295" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_565.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.31  <span class="s30">This diagram shows the anatomy of a sea star.</span></p><p>The echinoderm nervous system has a nerve ring at the center and five radial nerves extending outward along the arms.

They come in a large variety of shapes, colors, and sizes, with more than 1,800 species known. The characteristics of sea stars that set them apart from other echinoderm classes include thick arms that extend from a central disk where organs penetrate into the arms. Sea stars use their tube feet not only for gripping surfaces but also for grasping prey. Sea stars have two stomachs, one of which they can evert through their mouths to secrete digestive juices into or onto prey before ingestion. This process can essentially liquefy the prey and make digestion easier.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_567.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/echinoderm2" class="s25">View this </a>video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/echinoderm2) <span class="p">to explore a sea star’s body plan up close, watch one move across the sea floor, and see it devour a mussel.</span></p><p class="s20">382                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p>Brittle stars have long, thin arms that do not contain any organs.

The vertebrates contain more than 60,000 described species, divided into major groupings of the lampreys, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.<br/>Animals in the phylum <b>Chordata </b>share four key features that appear at some stage of their development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail (<span class="s32">Figure 15.33</span>). In certain groups, some of these traits are present only during embryonic development.<br/>The chordates are named for the <b>notochord</b>, which is a flexible, rod-shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species. It is located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord, and provides skeletal support through the length of the body. In some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal’s lifetime. In vertebrates, the notochord is present during embryonic development, at which time it induces the development of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. The notochord, however, is not found in the postnatal stage of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the <b>vertebral column </b>(the spine).<br/>The <b>dorsal hollow nerve cord </b>is derived from ectoderm that sinks below the surface of the skin and rolls into a hollow tube during development. In chordates, it is located dorsally to the notochord. In contrast, other animal phyla possess solid nerve cords that are located either ventrally or laterally. The nerve cord found in most chordate embryos develops into the brain and spinal cord, which compose the central nervous system.</p><p class="s27">Pharyngeal slits <span class="p">are openings in the pharynx, the region just posterior to the mouth, that extend to the outside environment. In organisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding. Some invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food from the water that enters the mouth. In fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, jaw supports. In tetrapods, the slits are further modified into components of the ear and tonsils, since there is no longer any need for gill supports in these air-breathing</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals                                                                                                                                                                                                           383</p><p>animals. <i><b>Tetrapod </b></i>means “four-footed,” and this group includes amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

The tail contains skeletal elements and muscles, which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species, such as fishes. In some terrestrial vertebrates, the tail may also function in balance, locomotion, courting, and signaling when danger is near. In many species, the tail is absent or reduced; for example, in apes, including humans, it is present in the embryo, but reduced in size and nonfunctional in adults.</p><p class="s29">Figure  15.33  <span class="s30">In chordates, four common features appear at some point in development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve  cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail.

Members of these groups possess the four distinctive features of chordates at some point during their development.<br/>The <b>tunicates </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 15.34</span>) are also called sea squirts. The name tunicate derives from the cellulose-like carbohydrate material, called the tunic, which covers the outer body. Although tunicates are classified as chordates, the adult forms are much modified in body plan and do not have a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, or a post-anal tail, although they do have pharyngeal slits. The larval form possesses all four structures. Most tunicates are hermaphrodites. Tunicate larvae hatch from eggs inside the adult tunicate’s body. After hatching, a tunicate larva swims for a few days until it finds a suitable surface on which it can attach, usually in a dark or shaded location. It then attaches by the head to the substrate and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form, at which point the notochord, nerve cord, and tail disappear.</p><p class="s20">384                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="153" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_570.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  15.34  </span>(a) This photograph shows a colony  of the  tunicate <i>Botrylloides  violaceus</i>.

The primary foods of tunicates are plankton and detritus. Seawater enters the tunicate’s body through its incurrent siphon. Suspended material is filtered out of this water by a mucus net (pharyngeal slits) and is passed into the intestine through the action of cilia.

Fishes were the earliest vertebrates, and jawless fishes were the earliest of these. Jawless fishes—the present day hagfishes and lampreys—have a distinct cranium and complex sense organs including eyes, distinguishing them from the invertebrate chordates. The jawed fishes evolved later and are extraordinarily diverse today. Fishes are active feeders, rather than sessile, suspension feeders.</p><p class="s34">Jawless Fishes</p><p>Jawless fishes are <b>craniates </b>(which includes all the chordate groups except the tunicates and lancelets) that represent an ancient vertebrate lineage that arose over one half-billion years ago. Some of the earliest jawless fishes were the <b>ostracoderms </b>(which translates as “shell-skin”). Ostracoderms, now extinct, were vertebrate fishes encased in bony armor, unlike present-day jawless fishes, which lack bone in their scales.<br/>The clade <b>Myxini </b>includes 67 species of hagfishes. <b>Hagfishes </b>are eel-like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates, other fishes, and marine mammals (<span class="s32">Figure 15.37</span><b>a</b>). Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world except for the polar regions. A unique feature of these animals is the slime glands beneath the skin that are able to release an extraordinary amount of mucus through surface pores. This mucus may allow the hagfish to escape from the grip of predators. Hagfish are known to enter the bodies of dead or dying organisms to devour them from the inside.</p><p class="s20">386                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="200" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_574.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.37  <span class="s30">(a) Pacific hagfishes are scavengers that live on the ocean floor.

This notochord provides support to the fish’s body. Although they are craniates, hagfishes are not vertebrates, since they do not replace the notochord with a vertebral column during development, as do the vertebrates.<br/>The clade <b>Petromyzontidae </b>includes approximately 40 species of lampreys. <b>Lampreys </b>are similar to hagfishes in size and shape; however, lampreys have a brain case and incomplete vertebrae. Lampreys lack paired appendages and bone, as do the hagfishes. As adults, lampreys are characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. Some species are parasitic as adults, attaching to and feeding on the body fluids of fish (<span class="s32">Figure 15.37</span><b>b</b>). Most species are free-living.<br/>Lampreys live primarily in coastal and fresh waters and have a worldwide temperate region distribution. All species spawn in fresh waters. Eggs are fertilized externally, and the larvae are distinctly different from the adult form, spending 3 to 15 years as suspension feeders. Once they attain sexual maturity, the adults reproduce and die within days. Lampreys have a notochord as adults.</p><p class="s34">Jawed Fishes</p><p class="s27">Gnathostomes <span class="p">or “jaw-mouths” are vertebrates that have jaws and include both cartilaginous and bony fishes. One of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the origin of the jaw, which is a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food. The evolution of jaws allowed early gnathostomes to exploit food resources that were unavailable to jawless fishes.</span></p><p>The clade <b>Chondrichthyes</b>, the cartilaginous fishes, is diverse, consisting of sharks (<span class="s32">Figure 15.38</span><b>a</b>), rays, and skates, together with sawfishes and a few dozen species of fishes called <i>chimaeras</i>, or ghost sharks. Chondrichthyes have paired fins and a skeleton made of cartilage. This clade arose approximately 370 million years ago in the middle Devonian. They are thought to have descended from an extinct group that had a skeleton made of bone; thus, the cartilaginous skeleton of Chondrichthyes is a later development. Parts of the shark skeleton are strengthened by granules of calcium carbonate, but this is not the same as bone.<br/>Most cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats, with a few species living in fresh water for some or all of their lives. Most sharks are carnivores that feed on live prey, either swallowing it whole or using their jaws and teeth to tear it into smaller pieces. Shark teeth likely evolved from the jagged scales that cover their skin. Some species of sharks and rays are suspension feeders that feed on plankton.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals                                                                                                                                                                                                           387</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="190" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_575.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.38  <span class="s30">(a) This hammerhead shark  is an example of a predatory cartilaginous fish.

Organs called <b>ampullae of Lorenzini </b>allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things, including their prey. Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals. Sharks, together with most fishes, also have a sense organ called the <b>lateral line</b>, which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water, and a sense that is often considered homologous to “hearing” in terrestrial vertebrates. The lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of the fish’s body.<br/>Sharks reproduce sexually and eggs are fertilized internally. Most species are ovoviviparous, that is, the fertilized egg is retained in the oviduct of the mother’s body, and the embryo is nourished by the egg yolk. The eggs hatch in the uterus and young are born alive and fully functional. Some species of sharks are oviparous: They lay eggs that hatch outside of the mother’s body. Embryos are protected by a shark egg case or “mermaid’s purse” that has the consistency of leather. The shark egg case has tentacles that snag in seaweed and give the newborn shark cover. A few species of sharks are viviparous, that is, the young develop within the mother’s body, and she gives live birth.<br/>Rays and skates include more than 500 species and are closely related to sharks. They can be distinguished from sharks by their flattened bodies, pectoral fins that are enlarged and fused to the head, and gill slits on their ventral surface (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">15.38<span style=" color: #000;">b</span><span class="p">). Like sharks, rays and skates have a cartilaginous skeleton. Most species are marine and live on the sea floor, with nearly a worldwide distribution.</span></p><p class="s34">Bony Fishes</p><p>Members of the clade <b>Osteichthyes</b>, or bony fishes, are characterized by a bony skeleton. The vast majority of present-day fishes belong to this group, which consists of approximately 30,000 species, making it the largest class of vertebrates in existence today.<br/>Nearly all bony fishes have an ossified skeleton with specialized bone cells (osteocytes) that produce and maintain a calcium phosphate matrix. This characteristic has only reverted in a few groups of Osteichthyes, such as sturgeons and paddlefish, which have primarily cartilaginous skeletons. The skin of bony fishes is often covered in overlapping scales, and glands in the skin secrete mucus that reduces drag when swimming and aids the fish in osmoregulation. Like sharks, bony fishes have a lateral line system that detects vibrations in water. Unlike sharks, some bony fish depend on their eyesight to locate prey. Bony fish are also unusual in possessing taste cells in the head and trunk region of the body that allow them to detect extremely small concentrations of molecules in the water.<br/>All bony fishes, like the cartilaginous fishes, use gills to breathe. Water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated by a protective, muscular flap called the operculum. Unlike sharks, bony fishes have a <b>swim bladder</b>, a gas-filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish. Bony fishes are further divided into two clades with living members: <b>Actinopterygii </b>(ray-finned fishes) and <b>Sarcopterygii </b>(lobe-finned fishes).<br/>The ray-finned fishes include many familiar fishes—tuna, bass, trout, and salmon (<span class="s32">Figure 15.39</span><b>a</b>), among others. Ray- finned fishes are named for the form of their fins—webs of skin supported by bony spines called rays. In contrast, the fins of lobe-finned fishes are fleshy and supported by bone (<span class="s32">Figure 15.39</span><b>b</b>). Living members of lobe-finned fishes include the less familiar lungfishes and coelacanth.</p><p class="s20">388                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p><span><IMG width="503" height="106" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_576.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.39  <span class="s30">The  (a)  sockeye salmon and  (b)  coelacanth are  both  bony  fishes   of the  Osteichthyes clade.

The term amphibian means “dual life,” which is a reference to the metamorphosis that many frogs undergo from a tadpole to an adult and the mixture of aquatic and terrestrial environments in their life cycle. Amphibians evolved in the Devonian period and were the earliest terrestrial tetrapods.<br/>As tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four well-developed limbs, although some species of salamanders and all caecilians possess only vestigial limbs. An important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist, permeable skin, achieved by mucus glands. The moist skin allows oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange with the environment, a process called <b>cutaneous respiration</b>. All living adult amphibian species are carnivorous, and some terrestrial amphibians have a sticky tongue that is used to capture prey.</p><p class="s34">Amphibian Diversity</p><p>Amphibia comprise an estimated 6,500 extant species that inhabit tropical and temperate regions around the world. Amphibians can be divided into three clades: <b>Urodela </b>(“tailed-ones”), the salamanders and newts; <b>Anura </b>(“tail-less ones”), the frogs and toads; and <b>Apoda </b>(“legless ones”), the caecilians.<br/>Living <b>salamanders </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 15.40</span><b>a</b>) include approximately 500 species, some of which are aquatic, others terrestrial, and some that live on land only as adults. Adult salamanders usually have a generalized tetrapod body plan with four limbs and a tail. Some salamanders are lungless, and respiration occurs through the skin or external gills. Some terrestrial salamanders have primitive lungs; a few species have both gills and lungs.<br/><span><IMG width="503" height="182" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_577.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_578.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.40  <span class="s30">(a)  Most salamanders have  legs  and  a  tail, but respiration varies  among species.

Frogs have a body plan that is more specialized than the salamander body plan for movement on land. Adult frogs use their hind limbs to jump many times their body length on land. Frogs have a number of modifications that allow them to avoid predators, including skin that acts as camouflage and defensive chemicals that are poisonous to predators secreted from glands in the skin.</span></p><p>Frog eggs are fertilized externally, as they are laid in moist environments. Frogs demonstrate a range of parental behaviors, with some species exhibiting little care, to species that carry eggs and tadpoles on their hind legs or backs. The life cycle consists of two stages: the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to an adult stage. The larval stage of a frog, the <b>tadpole</b>, is often a filter-feeding herbivore. Tadpoles usually have gills, a lateral line system, long-finned tails, but no limbs. At the end of the tadpole stage, frogs undergo a gradual metamorphosis into the adult form. During this stage, the gills and lateral line system disappear, and four limbs develop. The jaws become larger and are suited for carnivorous feeding, and the digestive system transforms into the typical short gut of a predator. An eardrum and air-breathing lungs also develop. These changes during metamorphosis allow the larvae to move onto land in the adult stage (<span class="s32">Figure 15.41</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="126" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_580.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.41  <span class="s30">A frog begins as a (a) tadpole and undergoes metamorphosis to become (b) a juvenile and finally (c) an adult.

They inhabit soil and are found primarily in the tropics of South America, Africa, and southern Asia where they are adapted for a soil- burrowing lifestyle and are nearly blind. Unlike most of the other amphibians that breed in or near water, reproduction in a drier soil habitat means that caecilians must utilize internal fertilization, and most species give birth to live young (</span><span style=" color: #C63;">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">15.42<span class="p">).</span></p><p><span><IMG width="381" height="175" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_581.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.42  <span class="s30">Caecilians lack external limbs and  are  well adapted for a soil-burrowing  lifestyle.

The evolution of amniotic membranes meant that the embryos of amniotes could develop within an aquatic environment inside the egg. This led to less dependence on a water environment for  development  and  allowed  the  amniotes  to  invade  drier  areas.  This  was  a  significant  evolutionary  change  that distinguished them from amphibians, which were restricted to moist environments due to their shell-less eggs. Although the shells of various amniotic species vary significantly, they all allow retention of water. The membranes of the amniotic egg also allowed gas exchange and sequestering of wastes within the enclosure of an eggshell. The shells of bird eggs are composed of calcium carbonate and are hard and brittle, but possess pores for gas and water exchange. The shells of reptile eggs are more leathery and pliable. Most mammals do not lay eggs; however, even with internal gestation, amniotic membranes are still present.</p><p class="s20">390                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p>In the past, the most common division of amniotes has been into classes Mammalia, Reptilia, and Aves. Birds are descended, however, from dinosaurs, so this classical scheme results in groups that are not true clades. We will discuss birds as a group distinct from reptiles with the understanding that this does not reflect evolutionary history.</p><p class="s34">Reptiles</p><p>Reptiles are tetrapods. Limbless reptiles—snakes—may have vestigial limbs and, like caecilians, are classified as tetrapods because they are descended from four-limbed ancestors. Reptiles lay shelled eggs on land. Even aquatic reptiles, like sea turtles, return to the land to lay eggs. They usually reproduce sexually with internal fertilization. Some species display ovoviviparity, with the eggs remaining in the mother’s body until they are ready to hatch. Other species are viviparous, with the offspring born alive.<br/>One of the key adaptations that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of their scaly skin, containing the protein keratin and waxy lipids, which prevented water loss from the skin. This occlusive skin means that reptiles cannot use their skin for respiration, like amphibians, and thus all must breathe with lungs. In addition, reptiles conserve valuable body water by excreting nitrogen in the form of uric acid paste. These characteristics, along with the shelled, amniotic egg, were the major reasons why reptiles became so successful in colonizing a variety of terrestrial habitats far from water.<br/>Reptiles are ectotherms, that is, animals whose main source of body heat comes from the environment. Behavioral maneuvers, like basking to heat themselves, or seeking shade or burrows to cool off, help them regulate their body temperature,<br/>Class Reptilia includes diverse species classified into four living clades. These are the Crocodilia, Sphenodontia, Squamata, and Testudines.<br/>The <b>Crocodilia </b>(“small lizard”) arose approximately 84 million years ago, and living species include alligators, crocodiles, and caimans. Crocodilians (<span class="s32">Figure 15.43</span><b>a</b>) live throughout the tropics of Africa, South America, the southeastern United States, Asia, and Australia. They are found in freshwater habitats, such as rivers and lakes, and spend most of their time in water. Some species are able to move on land due to their semi-erect posture.<br/><span><IMG width="503" height="420" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_582.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  15.43  </span>(a)  Crocodilians, such  as this  Siamese crocodile,  provide  parental care  for their  offspring.

Lizards differ from snakes by having four limbs, eyelids, and external ears, which are lacking in snakes. Lizard species range in size from chameleons and geckos that are a few centimeters in length to the Komodo dragon, which is about 3 meters in length.</span></p><p>Snakes are thought to have descended from either burrowing lizards or aquatic lizards over 100 million years ago (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">15.43<span style=" color: #000;">c</span><span class="p">). Snakes comprise about 3,000 species and are found on every continent except Antarctica. They range in size from 10 centimeter-long thread snakes to 7.5 meter-long pythons and anacondas. All snakes are carnivorous and eat small animals, birds, eggs, fish, and insects.</span></p><p>Turtles are members of the clade <b>Testudines </b>(“having a shell”) (<span class="s32">Figure 15.43</span><b>d</b>). Turtles are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell, made up of the carapace on the back and the plastron on the ventral surface, which develops from the ribs. Turtles arose approximately 200 million years ago, predating crocodiles, lizards, and snakes. Turtles lay eggs on land, although many species live in or near water. Turtles range in size from the speckled padloper tortoise at 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) to the leatherback sea turtle at 200 centimeters (over 6 feet). The term “turtle” is sometimes used to describe only those species of Testudines that live in the sea, with the terms “tortoise” and “terrapin” used to refer to species that live on land and in fresh water, respectively.</p><p class="s34">Birds</p><p>Data now suggest that birds belong within the reptile clade, but they display a number of unique adaptations that set them apart. Unlike the reptiles, birds are endothermic, meaning they generate their own body heat through metabolic processes. The most distinctive characteristic of birds is their feathers, which are modified reptilian scales. Birds have several different types of feathers that are specialized for specific functions, like contour feathers that streamline the bird’s exterior and loosely structured <b>down feathers </b>that insulate (<span class="s32">Figure 15.44</span><b>a</b>).<br/>Feathers not only permitted the earliest birds to glide, and ultimately engage in flapping flight, but they insulated the bird’s body, assisting the maintenance of endothermy, even in cooler temperatures. Powering a flying animal requires economizing on the amount of weight carried. As body weight increases, the muscle output and energetic cost required for flying increase. Birds have made several modifications to reduce body weight, including hollow or <b>pneumatic bones </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 15.44</span><b>b</b>) with air spaces that may be connected to air sacs and cross-linked struts within their bones to provide structural reinforcement. Parts of the vertebral skeleton and braincase are fused to increase its strength while lightening its weight. Most species of bird only possess one ovary rather than two, and no living birds have teeth in their jaw, further reducing body mass.<br/><span><IMG width="481" height="306" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_583.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.44  <span class="s30">(a) Primary  feathers are  located at the wing tip and  provide  thrust; secondary feathers are  located close to the body and provide lift.

Unlike mammalian lungs in which air flows in two directions as it is breathed in and out, air flows continuously through the bird’s lung to provide a more efficient system of gas exchange.</p><p class="s24">Mammals</p><p class="s27">Mammals <span class="p">are vertebrates that have hair and mammary glands used to provide nutrition for their young. Certain features of the jaw, skeleton, skin, and internal anatomy are also unique to mammals. The presence of hair is one of the key characteristics of a mammal. Although it is not very extensive in some groups, such as whales, hair has many important functions for mammals. Mammals are endothermic, and hair provides insulation by trapping a layer of air close to the body to retain metabolic heat. Hair also serves as a sensory mechanism through specialized hairs called vibrissae, better known as whiskers. These attach to nerves that transmit touch information, which is particularly useful to nocturnal or burrowing mammals. Hair can also provide protective coloration.</span></p><p>Mammalian skin includes secretory glands with various functions. <b>Sebaceous glands </b>produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin for water resistance and lubrication. Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body. <b>Sudoriferous glands </b>produce sweat and scent, which function in thermoregulation and communication, respectively. <b>Mammary glands </b>produce milk that is used to feed newborns. While male monotremes and eutherians possess mammary glands, male marsupials do not.<br/>The skeletal system of mammals possesses unique features that differentiate them from other vertebrates. Most mammals have <b>heterodont teeth</b>, meaning they have different types and shapes of teeth that allow them to feed on different kinds of foods. These different types of teeth include the incisors, the canines, premolars, and molars. The first two types are for cutting and tearing, whereas the latter two types are for crushing and grinding. Different groups have different proportions of each type, depending on their diet. Most mammals are also <b>diphyodonts</b>, meaning they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: deciduous or “baby” teeth, and permanent teeth. In other vertebrates, the teeth can be replaced throughout life.<br/>Modern mammals are divided into three broad groups: monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians (or placental mammals). The eutherians, or placental mammals, and the marsupials collectively are called therian mammals, whereas monotremes are called metatherians.<br/>There are three living species of <b>monotremes</b>: the platypus and two species of echidnas, or spiny anteaters (<span class="s32">Figure 15.45</span>). The platypus and one species of echidna are found in Australia, whereas the other species of echidna is found in New Guinea. Monotremes are unique among mammals, as they lay leathery eggs, similar to those of reptiles, rather than giving birth to live young. However, the eggs are retained within the mother’s reproductive tract until they are almost ready to hatch. Once the young hatch, the female begins to secrete milk from pores in a ridge of mammary tissue along the ventral side of her body. Like other mammals, monotremes are endothermic but regulate body temperatures somewhat lower (90<br/>°F, 32 °C) than placental mammals do (98 °F, 37 °C). Like reptiles, monotremes have one posterior opening for urinary, fecal, and reproductive products, rather than three separate openings like placental mammals do. Adult monotremes lack teeth.<br/><span><IMG width="503" height="175" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_584.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.45 <span class="s30">The platypus (left), a monotreme, possesses a leathery beak  and lays eggs rather  than giving birth to live young.

Australian marsupials number over 230 species and include the kangaroo, koala, bandicoot, and Tasmanian devil (<span class="s32">Figure 15.46</span>). Most species of marsupials possess a pouch in which the young reside after birth, receiving milk and continuing to develop. Before birth, marsupials have a less complex placental connection, and the young are born much less developed than in placental mammals.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals                                                                                                                                                                                                           393</p><p><span><IMG width="381" height="253" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_585.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 15.46  <span class="s30">The Tasmanian devil is one of several marsupials native to Australia.

There are several groups of eutherians, including Insectivora, the insect eaters; Edentata, the toothless anteaters; Rodentia, the rodents; Chiroptera, the bats; Cetacea, the aquatic mammals including whales; Carnivora, carnivorous mammals including dogs, cats, and bears; and Primates, which includes humans. <b>Eutherian mammals </b>are sometimes called placental mammals, because all species have a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother, allowing for gas, fluid, waste, and nutrient exchange. While other mammals may possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta, all eutherians have a complex placenta during gestation.</p><p class="s34">Primates</p><p>Order <b>Primates </b>of class Mammalia includes lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, and the apes, which include humans. Non-human primates live primarily in tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1 ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates are of particular interest to us as they allow us to understand the evolution of our own species.<br/>All primate species have adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers, although not all species are arboreal. This arboreal heritage of primates resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for <b>brachiation</b>, or climbing and swinging through trees. These adaptations include, but are not limited to 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs that are widely separated from fingers (except humans), which allow for gripping branches, and 3) <b>stereoscopic vision</b>, two overlapping visual fields, which allows for the depth perception necessary to gauge distance. Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of many other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright.<br/>Order Primates is divided into two groups: prosimians and anthropoids. <b>Prosimians </b>include the bush babies of Africa, the lemurs of Madagascar, and the lorises, pottos, and tarsiers of Southeast Asia. <b>Anthropoids </b>include monkeys, lesser apes, and great apes (<span class="s32">Figure 15.47</span>). In general, prosimians tend to be nocturnal, smaller in size than anthropoids, and have relatively smaller brains compared to anthropoids.</p><p class="s20">394                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="310" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_586.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  15.47  <span class="s30">Primates can  be  divided  into prosimians, such  as the  (a) lemur,  and  anthropoids.

Animals are eukaryotic, multicellular, heterotrophic organisms that<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals                                                                                                                                                                                                           399</p><p>ingest their food and usually develop into motile creatures with a fixed body plan. Most members of the animal kingdom have differentiated tissues of four main classes—nervous, muscular, connective, and epithelial—that are specialized to perform different functions. Most animals reproduce sexually, leading to a developmental sequence that is relatively similar across the animal kingdom.<br/>Organisms in the animal kingdom are classified based on their body morphology and development. True animals are divided into those with radial versus bilateral symmetry. Animals with three germ layers, called triploblasts, are further characterized by the presence or absence of an internal body cavity called a coelom. Animals with a body cavity may be either coelomates or pseudocoelomates, depending on which tissue gives rise to the coelom. Coelomates are further divided into two groups called protostomes and deuterostomes, based on a number of developmental characteristics.</p><p class="s52">15.2 Sponges and Cnidarians</p><p>Animals included in phylum Porifera are parazoans and do not possess true tissues. These organisms show a simple organization. Sponges have multiple cell types that are geared toward executing various metabolic functions.<br/>Cnidarians have outer and inner tissue layers sandwiching a noncellular mesoglea. Cnidarians possess a well-formed digestive system and carry out extracellular digestion. The cnidocyte is a specialized cell for delivering toxins to prey and predators. Cnidarians have separate sexes. They have a life cycle that involves morphologically distinct forms—medusoid and polypoid—at various stages in their life cycle.</p><p class="s52">15.3 Flatworms, Nematodes, and Arthropods</p><p>Flatworms are acoelomate, triploblastic animals. They lack circulatory and respiratory systems, and have a rudimentary excretory system. The digestive system is incomplete in most species. There are four traditional classes of flatworms, the largely free-living turbellarians, the ectoparasitic monogeneans, and the endoparasitic trematodes and cestodes. Trematodes have complex life cycles involving a secondary mollusk host and a primary host in which sexual reproduction takes place. Cestodes, or tapeworms, infect the digestive systems of primary vertebrate hosts.<br/>Nematodes are pseudocoelomate members of the clade Ecdysozoa. They have a complete digestive system and a pseudocoelomic body cavity. This phylum includes free-living as well as parasitic organisms. They include dioecious and hermaphroditic species. Nematodes have a poorly developed excretory system. Embryonic development is external and proceeds through larval stages separated by molts.<br/>Arthropods represent the most successful phylum of animals on Earth, in terms of number of species as well as the number of individuals. They are characterized by a segmented body and jointed appendages. In the basic body plan, a pair of appendages is present per body segment. Within the phylum, classification is based on mouthparts, number of appendages, and modifications of appendages. Arthropods bear a chitinous exoskeleton. Gills, tracheae, and book lungs facilitate respiration. Embryonic development may include multiple larval stages.</p><p class="s52">15.4 Mollusks and Annelids</p><p>The phylum Mollusca is a large, mainly marine group of invertebrates. Mollusks show a variety of morphologies. Many mollusks secrete a calcareous shell for protection, but in other species, the shell is reduced or absent. Mollusks are protostomes. The dorsal epidermis in mollusks is modified to form the mantle, which encloses the mantle cavity and visceral organs. This cavity is distinct from the coelomic cavity, which the adult animal retains, surrounding the heart. Respiration is facilitated by gills known as ctenidia. A chitinous scraper called the radula is present in most mollusks. Mollusks are mostly dioecious and are divided into seven classes.<br/>The phylum Annelida includes worm-like, segmented animals. Segmentation is both external and internal, which is called metamerism. Annelids are protostomes. The presence of chitinous hairs called chaetae is characteristic of most members. These animals have well-developed nervous and digestive systems. Polychaete annelids have parapodia that participate in locomotion and respiration. Suckers are seen in the order Hirudinea. Breeding systems include separate sexes and hermaphroditism.</p><p class="s52">15.5 Echinoderms and Chordates</p><p>Echinoderms are deuterostome marine organisms. This phylum of animals bear a calcareous endoskeleton composed of ossicles covered by a spiny skin. Echinoderms possess a water-based circulatory system. The madreporite is the point of entry and exit for water for the water vascular system.<br/>The characteristic features of Chordata are a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. Chordata contains two clades of invertebrates: Urochordata (tunicates) and Cephalochordata (lancelets), together with the</p><p class="s20">400                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 15 | Diversity of Animals</p><p>vertebrates. Most tunicates live on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders. Lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on phytoplankton and other microorganisms.</p><p class="s52">15.6 Vertebrates</p><p>The earliest vertebrates that diverged from the invertebrate chordates were the jawless fishes. Hagfishes are eel-like scavengers that feed on dead invertebrates and other fishes. Lampreys are characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth, and some species are parasitic on other fishes. Gnathostomes include the jawed fishes (cartilaginous and bony fishes) as well as all other tetrapods. Cartilaginous fishes include sharks, rays, skates, and ghost sharks. Bony fishes can be further divided into ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes.<br/>As tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four well-developed limbs, although some species of salamanders and all caecilians are limbless. Amphibians have a moist, permeable skin used for cutaneous respiration. Amphibia can be divided into three clades: salamanders (Urodela), frogs (Anura), and caecilians (Apoda). The life cycle of amphibians consists of two distinct stages: the larval stage and metamorphosis to an adult stage.<br/>The amniotes are distinguished from amphibians by the presence of a terrestrially adapted egg protected by amniotic membranes. The amniotes include reptiles, birds, and mammals. A key adaptation that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of scaly skin. Reptilia includes four living clades: Crocodilia (crocodiles and alligators), Sphenodontia (tuataras), Squamata (lizards and snakes), and Testudines (turtles).<br/>Birds are endothermic amniotes. Feathers act as insulation and allow for flight. Birds have pneumatic bones that are hollow rather than tissue-filled. Airflow through bird lungs travels in one direction. Birds evolved from dinosaurs.<br/>Mammals have hair and mammary glands. Mammalian skin includes various secretory glands. Mammals are endothermic, like birds. There are three groups of mammals living today: monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians. Monotremes are unique among mammals as they lay eggs, rather than giving birth to live young. Eutherian mammals have a complex placenta.<br/>There are 16 extant (living) orders of eutherian mammals. Humans are most closely related to Primates, all of which have adaptations for climbing trees, although not all species are arboreal. Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, and typically one young per pregnancy, stereoscopic vision, and a trend toward holding the body upright. Primates are divided into two groups: prosimians and anthropoids.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 15.3 </span><span class="p">Which of the following statements is false?</span></p><p>a.

The multicellular bodies of animals consist of tissues that make up more complex organs and organ systems. The organ systems of an animal maintain homeostasis within the multicellular body. These systems are adapted to obtain the necessary nutrients and other resources needed by the cells of the body, to remove the wastes those cells produce, to coordinate the activities of the cells, tissues, and organs throughout the body, and to coordinate the many responses of the individual organism to its environment.</p><p class="s20">404                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_589.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">16.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Homeostasis and Osmoregulation</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Explain the concept of homeostasis<br/>•   Describe thermoregulation of endothermic and ectothermic animals<br/>•   Explain how the kidneys serve as the main osmoregulatory organs in the human body<br/>Homeostasis refers to the relatively stable state inside the body of an animal. Animal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes in order to maintain this steady state. Examples of internal conditions maintained homeostatically are the level of blood glucose, body temperature, blood calcium level. These conditions remain stable because of physiologic processes that result in negative feedback relationships. If the blood glucose or calcium rises, this sends a signal to organs responsible for lowering blood glucose or calcium. The signals that restore the normal levels are examples of negative feedback. When homeostatic mechanisms fail, the results can be unfavorable for the animal. Homeostatic mechanisms keep the body in dynamic equilibrium by constantly adjusting to the changes that the body’s systems encounter. Even an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium. Two examples of factors that are regulated homeostatically are temperature and water content. The processes that maintain homeostasis of these two factors are called thermoregulation and osmoregulation.</p><p class="s24">Homeostasis</p><p>The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a specific value of some aspect of the body or its cells called a <b>set point</b>. While there are normal fluctuations from the set point, the body’s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point. A change in the internal or external environment is called a stimulus and is detected by a receptor; the response of the system is to adjust the activities of the system so the value moves back toward the set point. For instance, if the body becomes too warm, adjustments are made to cool the animal. If glucose levels in the blood rise after a meal, adjustments are made to lower them and to get the nutrient into tissues that need it or to store it for later use.<br/>When a change occurs in an animal’s environment, an adjustment must be made so that the internal environment of the body and cells remains stable. The receptor that senses the change in the environment is part of a feedback mechanism. The stimulus—temperature, glucose, or calcium levels—is detected by the receptor. The receptor sends information to a control center, often the brain, which relays appropriate signals to an effector organ that is able to cause an appropriate change, either up or down, depending on the information the sensor was sending.</p><p class="s24">Thermoregulation</p><p>Animals can be divided into two groups: those that maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental temperatures, and those that have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the environmental temperature. Animals that do not have internal control of their body temperature are called <b>ectotherms</b>. The body temperature of these organisms is generally similar to the temperature of the environment, although the individual organisms may do things that keep their bodies slightly below or above the environmental temperature. This can include burrowing underground on a hot day or resting in the sunlight on a cold day. The ectotherms have been called cold-blooded, a term that may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature.<br/>An animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called an <b>endotherm</b>. These animals are able to maintain a level of activity that an ectothermic animal cannot because they generate internal heat that keeps their cellular processes operating optimally even when the environment is cold.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  405</p><p><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_590.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_591.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/thermoregulate2" class="s25">Watch  this  </a>Discovery  Channel  video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/thermoregulate2)  <span class="p">on  thermoregulation  to  see illustrations of the process in a variety of animals.</span></p><p>Animals conserve or dissipate heat in a variety of ways. Endothermic animals have some form of insulation. They have fur, fat, or feathers. Animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating layer of air between their skin and internal organs. Polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and yet maintain a constant, warm, body temperature. The arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when it curls up to sleep in cold weather. Mammals can increase body heat production by shivering, which is an involuntary increase in muscle activity. In addition, arrector pili muscles can contract causing individual hairs to stand up when the individual is cold. This increases the insulating effect of the hair. Humans retain this reaction, which does not have the intended effect on our relatively hairless bodies; it causes “goose bumps” instead. Mammals use layers of fat as insulation also. Loss of significant amounts of body fat will compromise an individual’s ability to conserve heat.<br/>Ectotherms and endotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. Vasodilation, the opening up of arteries to the skin by relaxation of their smooth muscles, brings more blood and heat to the body surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, cooling the body. Vasoconstriction, the narrowing of blood vessels to the skin by contraction of their smooth muscles, reduces blood flow in peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and vital organs, conserving heat. Some animals have adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins that are flowing next to each other, warming blood returning to the heart. This is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the heart and other internal organs. The countercurrent adaptation is found in dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds.<br/>Some ectothermic animals use changes in their behavior to help regulate body temperature. They simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too warm. The same animals may climb onto rocks in the evening to capture heat on a cold desert night before entering their burrows.<br/>Thermoregulation is coordinated by the nervous system (<span class="s32">Figure 16.2</span>). The processes of temperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain. The hypothalamus maintains the set point for body temperature through reflexes that cause vasodilation or vasoconstriction and shivering or sweating. The sympathetic nervous system under control of the hypothalamus directs the responses that effect the changes in temperature loss or gain that return the body to the set point. The set point may be adjusted in some instances. During an infection, compounds called pyrogens are produced and circulate to the hypothalamus resetting the thermostat to a higher value. This allows the body’s temperature to increase to a new homeostatic equilibrium point in what is commonly called a fever. The increase in body heat makes the body less optimal for bacterial growth and increases the activities of cells so they are better able to fight the infection.</p><p class="s20">406                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p class="s29">Figure 16.2 <span class="s30">The body is able to regulate temperature in response to signals from the nervous system.</span></p><p>When  bacteria are  destroyed by leukocytes, pyrogens are  released into the  blood.

The fluids inside and surrounding cells are composed of water, electrolytes, and nonelectrolytes. An electrolyte is a compound that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water. A nonelectrolyte, in contrast, does not dissociate into ions in water. The body’s fluids include blood plasma, fluid that exists within cells, and the </span>interstitial fluid <span class="p">that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body. The membranes of the body (both the membranes around cells and the “membranes” made of cells lining body cavities) are semipermeable membranes. Semipermeable membranes are permeable to certain types of solutes and to water, but typically cell membranes are impermeable to solutes.</span></p><p>The body does not exist in isolation. There is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system. Excess water, electrolytes, and wastes are transported to the kidneys and excreted, helping to maintain osmotic balance. Insufficient fluid intake results in fluid conservation by the kidneys. Biological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of food and water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. Without a mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure, or when a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can have dire consequences.<br/>Mammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific concentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid compartments can also change temporarily. Since blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a direct bearing on blood pressure.</p><p class="s34">Excretory System</p><p>The human excretory system functions to remove waste from the body through the skin as sweat, the lungs in the form of exhaled carbon dioxide, and through the urinary system in the form of urine. All three of these systems participate in osmoregulation and waste removal. Here we focus on the urinary system, which is comprised of the paired kidneys, the ureter, urinary bladder and urethra (<span class="s32">Figure 16.3</span>). The <b>kidneys </b>are a pair of bean-shaped structures that are located just below the liver in the body cavity.

All the blood in the human body is filtered about 60 times a day by the kidneys. The nephrons remove wastes, concentrate them, and form urine that is collected in the bladder.<br/>Internally, the kidney has three regions—an outer cortex, a medulla in the middle, and the renal pelvis, which is the expanded end of the ureter. The renal cortex contains the <b>nephrons</b>—the functional unit of the kidney. The renal pelvis collects the urine and leads to the <b>ureter </b>on the outside of the kidney. The ureters are urine-bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the <b>urinary bladder</b>.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="253" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_593.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  16.3 <span class="s30">The human excretory system is made up of the kidneys, ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra.

(credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH)</span></p><p>Blood enters each kidney from the aorta, the main artery supplying the body below the heart, through a <b>renal artery</b>. It is distributed in smaller vessels until it reaches each nephron in capillaries. Within the nephron the blood comes in intimate contact with the waste-collecting tubules in a structure called the glomerulus. Water and many solutes present in the blood, including ions of sodium, calcium, magnesium, and others; as well as wastes and valuable substances such as amino acids, glucose and vitamins, leave the blood and enter the tubule system of the nephron. As materials pass through the tubule much of the water, required ions, and useful compounds are reabsorbed back into the capillaries that surround the tubules leaving the wastes behind. Some of this reabsorption requires active transport and consumes ATP. Some wastes, including ions and some drugs remaining in the blood, diffuse out of the capillaries into the interstitial fluid and are taken up by the tubule cells. These wastes are then actively secreted into the tubules. The blood then collects in larger and larger vessels and leaves the kidney in the renal vein. The <b>renal vein </b>joins the inferior vena cava, the main vein that returns blood to the heart from the lower body. The amounts of water and ions reabsorbed into the circulatory system are carefully regulated and this is an important way the body regulates its water content and ion levels. The waste is collected in larger tubules and then leaves the kidney in the ureter, which leads to the bladder where urine, the combination of waste materials and water, is stored.<br/>The bladder contains sensory nerves, stretch receptors that signal when it needs to be emptied. These signals create the urge to urinate, which can be voluntarily suppressed up to a limit. The conscious decision to urinate sets in play signals that open the sphincters, rings of smooth muscle that close off the opening, to the <b>urethra </b>that allows urine to flow out of the bladder and the body.</p><p class="s20">408                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p class="s16">Dialysis Technician</p><p>Dialysis  is  a  medical   process of  removing   wastes and  excess water  from  the  blood  by  diffusion  and ultrafiltration.  When  kidney  function  fails, dialysis  must  be  done  to artificially rid the  body  of wastes and fluids. This is a vital process to keep  patients alive. In some cases, the  patients undergo artificial dialysis until they are eligible for a kidney transplant. In others who are not candidates for kidney transplants, dialysis is a lifelong necessity.<br/>Dialysis technicians typically work in hospitals and  clinics. While some roles  in this field include  equipment development and  maintenance, most  dialysis  technicians work  in  direct  patient   care. Their  on-the-job duties,  which typically occur  under  the direct supervision of a registered nurse, focus  on providing dialysis treatments. This can  include  reviewing  patient  history  and  current  condition,  assessing and  responding to patient  needs before  and  during  treatment, and  monitoring  the  dialysis  process.

While plants can obtain nutrients from their roots and the energy molecules required for cellular function through the process of photosynthesis, animals obtain their nutrients by the consumption of other organisms. At the cellular level, the biological molecules necessary for animal function are amino acids, lipid molecules,  nucleotides,  and  simple  sugars.  However,  the  food  consumed  consists  of  protein,  fat,  and  complex carbohydrates. Animals must convert these macromolecules into the simple molecules required for maintaining cellular function. The conversion of the food consumed to the nutrients required is a multistep process involving digestion and absorption. During digestion, food particles are broken down to smaller components, which are later absorbed by the body. This happens by both physical means, such as chewing, and by chemical means.<br/>One of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake, storage, and energy expenditure. Taking in more food energy than is used in activity leads to storage of the excess in the form of fat deposits. The rise in obesity and the resulting diseases like type 2 diabetes makes understanding the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health all the more important.</p><p class="s24">The Human Digestive System</p><p>The process of digestion begins in the mouth with the intake of food (<span class="s32">Figure 16.4</span>). The teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically breaking food into smaller particles. The enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically break down food. The food is then swallowed and enters the <b>esophagus</b>—a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Using <b>peristalsis</b>, or wave-like smooth-muscle contractions, the muscles of the esophagus push the food toward the stomach. The stomach contents are extremely acidic, with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5. This acidity kills microorganisms, breaks down food tissues, and activates digestive enzymes. Further breakdown of food takes place in the small intestine where bile produced by the liver, and enzymes produced by the small intestine and the pancreas, continue the process of digestion. The smaller molecules are absorbed into the blood stream through the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestine. The waste material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is stored until it is excreted through the anus.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  409</p><p><span><IMG width="326" height="466" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_596.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 16.4 <span class="s30">The components of the human digestive system are shown.</span></p><p class="s34">Oral Cavity</p><p>Both physical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth or <b>oral cavity</b>, which is the point of entry of food into the digestive system. The food is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food to begin the process of physically breaking it down into smaller particles.<br/>The chemical process of digestion begins during chewing as food mixes with saliva, produced by the <b>salivary glands </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 16.5</span>). Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains lysozyme, which has antibacterial action. It also contains an enzyme called salivary <b>amylase </b>that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. Another enzyme called lipase is produced by cells in the tongue to break down fats. The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the <b>bolus </b>for swallowing. The tongue helps in swallowing—moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx. The pharynx opens to two passageways: the esophagus and the trachea. The esophagus leads to the stomach and the trachea leads to the lungs. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that covers the tracheal opening during swallowing to prevent food from entering the lungs.</p><p class="s20">410                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="264" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_597.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  16.5  <span class="s30">(a)  Digestion  of food  begins in the  mouth.

The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed. The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo peristalsis that pushes the food toward the stomach. The peristaltic wave is unidirectional—it moves food from the mouth the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible, except in the case of the vomit reflex. The peristaltic movement of the esophagus is an involuntary reflex; it takes place in response to the act of swallowing.<br/>Ring-like muscles called sphincters form valves in the digestive system. The gastro-esophageal sphincter (or cardiac sphincter) is located at the stomach end of the esophagus. In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens, and the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the stomach from traveling up the esophagus. Acid reflux or “heartburn” occurs when the acidic digestive juices escape into the esophagus.</p><p class="s34">Stomach</p><p>A large part of protein digestion occurs in the stomach (<span class="s32">Figure 16.7</span>). The <b>stomach </b>is a saclike organ that secretes gastric digestive juices.<br/>Protein digestion is carried out by an enzyme called <b>pepsin </b>in the stomach chamber. The highly acidic environment kills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the catabolism of protein in the food. Chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach caused by contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles. The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called <b>chyme</b>. Gastric emptying occurs within two to six hours after a meal. Only a small amount of chyme is released into the small intestine at a time. The movement of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine is regulated by hormones, stomach distension and muscular reflexes that influence the pyloric sphincter.<br/>The stomach lining is unaffected by pepsin and the acidity because pepsin is released in an inactive form and the stomach has a thick mucus lining that protects the underlying tissue.</p><p class="s34">Small  Intestine</p><p>Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. The <b>small intestine </b>is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates is completed. The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger- like projections called the villi. The top surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli. The epithelial cells of these structures absorb nutrients from the digested food and release them to the bloodstream on the other side. The villi and microvilli, with their many folds, increase the surface area of the small intestine and increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients.<br/>The human small intestine is over 6 m (19.6 ft) long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum. The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter. The chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices, an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme from the stomach. Pancreatic juices contain several digestive enzymes that break down starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. <b>Bile </b>is produced in the liver and stored<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  411</p><p>and concentrated in the gallbladder; it enters the duodenum through the bile duct. Bile contains bile salts, which make lipids accessible to the water-soluble enzymes. The monosaccharides, amino acids, bile salts, vitamins, and other nutrients are absorbed by the cells of the intestinal lining.<br/>The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements. The ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, “worm-like,” appendix is located at the ileocecal valve. The appendix of humans has a minor role in immunity.</p><p class="s34">Large  Intestine</p><p>The <b>large intestine </b>reabsorbs the water from indigestible food material and processes the waste material (<span class="s32">Figure 16.6</span>). The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter. It has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the waste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or “intestinal flora” that aid in the digestive processes. The <b>colon </b>has four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The main functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material.<br/><span><IMG width="402" height="267" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_598.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  16.6  <span class="s30">The large  intestine reabsorbs water  from undigested food and  stores waste until it is eliminated.

Accessory organs add secretions and enzymes that break down food into nutrients. Accessory organs include the salivary glands, the liver, the pancreas, and the gall bladder.

The liver also processes the absorbed vitamins and fatty acids and synthesizes many plasma proteins.

During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down into glucose and used to provide energy within the cells of the body. Complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be broken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce the enzyme necessary to digest cellulose (fiber). The intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition from these plant fibers. These plant fibers are known as dietary fiber and are an important component of the diet. The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored for later use in the liver and muscle tissue. Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy during food shortage. Fats are stored under the skin of mammals for insulation and energy reserves.<br/>Proteins in food are broken down during digestion and the resulting amino acids are absorbed. All of the proteins in the body must be formed from these amino-acid constituents; no proteins are obtained directly from food.<br/>Fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. Fatty foods are also significant sources of energy, and fatty acids are required for the construction of lipid membranes. Fats are also required in the diet to aid the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.<br/>While the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from precursors, there are some nutrients that must be obtained from food. These nutrients are termed <b>essential nutrients</b>, meaning they must be eaten, because the body cannot produce them.<br/>The fatty acids omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids. <b>Vitamins </b>are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities. Many of these assist enzymes in their function and, for this reason, are called coenzymes. Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health. <b>Minerals </b>are another set of inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food. Minerals perform many functions, from muscle and nerve function, to acting as enzyme cofactors. Certain amino acids also must be procured from food and cannot be synthesized by the body. These amino acids are the “essential” amino acids. The human body can synthesize only 11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food.</p><p class="s20">414                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p class="s16">Obesity</p><p>With obesity  at  high  rates in the  United  States, there  is a  public  health  focus  on  reducing obesity  and associated health  risks, which include diabetes, colon and  breast cancer, and  cardiovascular disease. How does the food consumed contribute to obesity?<br/>Fatty foods  are  calorie-dense, meaning that they have  more  calories per unit mass than  carbohydrates  or proteins. One gram of carbohydrates has  four calories, one gram of protein has  four calories, and one gram of fat has  nine calories. Animals tend to seek lipid-rich food for their higher energy content. Greater amounts of food energy taken  in than the body’s requirements will result in storage of the excess in fat deposits.<br/>Excess carbohydrate is used by the liver to synthesize glycogen. When  glycogen stores are  full, additional glucose is converted into fatty acids.  These fatty acids  are stored in adipose tissue cells—the fat cells in the mammalian body whose primary role is to store  fat for later use.<br/>The  rate  of obesity  among children  is  rapidly  rising  in the  United  States. To  combat childhood  obesity and  ensure that  children  get  a  healthy   start  in life, in 2010  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama launched the Let’s  Move!  campaign. The  goal  of  this  campaign is  to  educate parents and  caregivers on  providing healthy   nutrition  and  encouraging active  lifestyles  in future  generations. This  program aims  to  involve the  entire  community, including  parents, teachers, and  healthcare providers to ensure that  children  have access to healthy  foods—more fruits,  vegetables, and  whole  grains—and consume fewer  calories  from processed foods.  Another goal is to ensure that children get physical  activity. With the increase in television viewing  and  stationary pursuits such  as video  games, sedentary lifestyles  have  become the  norm.

The human circulatory system has a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the body. This extensive network supplies the cells, tissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste compounds.<br/>The medium for transport of gases and other molecules is the blood, which continually circulates through the system. Pressure differences within the system cause the movement of the blood and are created by the pumping of the heart.<br/>Gas exchange between tissues and the blood is an essential function of the circulatory system. In humans, other mammals, and birds, blood absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide in the lungs. Thus the circulatory and respiratory system, whose function is to obtain oxygen and discharge carbon dioxide, work in tandem.</p><p class="s24">The Respiratory System</p><p>Take a breath in and hold it. Wait several seconds and then let it out. Humans, when they are not exerting themselves, breathe approximately 15 times per minute on average. This equates to about 900 breaths an hour or 21,600 breaths per day. With every inhalation, air fills the lungs, and with every exhalation, it rushes back out. That air is doing more than just inflating and deflating the lungs in the chest cavity. The air contains oxygen that crosses the lung tissue, enters the bloodstream, and travels to organs and tissues. There, oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide, which is a cellular waste material. Carbon dioxide exits the cells, enters the bloodstream, travels back to the lungs, and is expired out of the body during exhalation.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  415</p><p>Breathing is both a voluntary and an involuntary event. How often a breath is taken and how much air is inhaled or exhaled is regulated by the respiratory center in the brain in response to signals it receives about the carbon dioxide content of the blood. However, it is possible to override this automatic regulation for activities such as speaking, singing and swimming under water.<br/>During inhalation the <b>diaphragm </b>descends creating a negative pressure around the lungs and they begin to inflate, drawing in air from outside the body. The air enters the body through the <b>nasal cavity </b>located just inside the nose (<span class="s32">Figure 16.9</span>). As the air passes through the nasal cavity, the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified by moisture from mucous membranes. These processes help equilibrate the air to the body conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause. Particulate matter that is floating in the air is removed in the nasal passages by hairs, mucus, and cilia. Air is also chemically sampled by the sense of smell.<br/>From the nasal cavity, air passes through the <b>pharynx </b>(throat) and the <b>larynx </b>(voice box) as it makes its way to the <b>trachea </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 16.9</span>). The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body. The human trachea is a cylinder, about 25 to 30 cm (9.8–11.8 in) long, which sits in front of the esophagus and extends from the pharynx into the chest cavity to the lungs. It is made of incomplete rings of cartilage and smooth muscle. The cartilage provides strength and support to the trachea to keep the passage open. The trachea is lined with cells that have cilia and secrete mucus. The mucus catches particles that have been inhaled, and the cilia move the particles toward the pharynx.<br/>The end of the trachea divides into two bronchi that enter the right and left lung. Air enters the lungs through the <b>primary bronchi</b>. The primary bronchus divides, creating smaller and smaller diameter <b>bronchi </b>until the passages are under 1 mm (.03 in) in diameter when they are called <b>bronchioles </b>as they split and spread through the lung. Like the trachea, the bronchus and bronchioles are made of cartilage and smooth muscle. Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction (parasympathetic) or relaxation (sympathetic) in the bronchi and bronchioles, depending on the nervous system’s cues. The final bronchioles are the respiratory bronchioles. Alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each respiratory bronchiole. At the end of each duct are alveolar sacs, each containing 20 to 30 <b>alveoli</b>. Gas exchange occurs only in the alveoli. The alveoli are thin-walled and look like tiny bubbles within the sacs. The alveoli are in direct contact with capillaries of the circulatory system. Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from the alveoli into the blood. In addition, carbon dioxide will diffuse from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled. The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes the structural and functional relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Estimates for the surface area of alveoli in the lungs vary around 100 m<span class="s54">2</span>. This large area is about the area of half a tennis court. This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the alveolar cells, allows gases to easily diffuse across the cells.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="696" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_605.png"/></span></p><p class="s20">416                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p class="s29">Figure  16.9 <span class="s30">Air enters the respiratory system through  the nasal cavity, and  then  passes through  the pharynx  and the trachea into the lungs.

In all vertebrate organisms this is a closed-loop system, in which the blood is largely separated from the body’s other extracellular fluid compartment, the interstitial fluid, which is the fluid bathing the cells. Blood circulates inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around one of two circulatory routes, then returns to the heart again; this is a <b>closed circulatory system</b>. <b>Open circulatory systems </b>are found in invertebrate animals in which the circulatory fluid bathes the internal organs directly even though it may be moved about with a pumping heart.</p><p class="s24">The Heart</p><p>The heart is a complex muscle that consists of two pumps: one that pumps blood through <b>pulmonary circulation </b>to the lungs, and the other that pumps blood through <b>systemic circulation </b>to the rest of the body’s tissues (and the heart itself).<br/>The heart is asymmetrical, with the left side being larger than the right side, correlating with the different sizes of the pulmonary and systemic circuits (<span class="s32">Figure 16.10</span>). In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one <b>atrium </b>and one <b>ventricle </b>on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the systemic circulation through the major veins: the <b>superior vena cava</b>, which drains blood from the head and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as the <b>inferior vena cava</b>, which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the <b>tricuspid valve</b>, which prevents the backflow of blood. After it is filled, the right ventricle contracts, pumping the blood to the lungs for reoxygenation. The left atrium receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. This blood passes through the <b>bicuspid valve </b>to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped into the <b>aorta</b>. The aorta is the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals.

The <b>cardiac cycle </b>is the flow of blood through the heart coordinated by electrochemical signals that cause the heart muscle to contract and relax. In each cardiac cycle, a sequence of contractions pushes out the blood, pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase, where the heart fills with blood. These two phases are called the <b>systole </b>(contraction) and <b>diastole </b>(relaxation), respectively (<span class="s32">Figure 16.11</span>). The signal for contraction begins at a location on the outside of the right atrium. The electrochemical signal moves from there across the atria causing them to contract. The contraction of the atria forces blood through the valves into the ventricles. Closing of these valves caused by the contraction of the ventricles produces a “lub” sound. The signal has, by this time, passed down the walls of the heart, through a point between the right atrium and right ventricle. The signal then causes the ventricles to contract. The ventricles contract together forcing blood into the aorta and the pulmonary arteries. Closing of the valves to these arteries caused by blood being drawn back toward the heart during ventricular relaxation produces a monosyllabic “dub” sound.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  419</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="305" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_609.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 16.11 <span class="s30">In each cardiac cycle, a series of contractions (systoles) and relaxations (diastoles) pumps blood through the heart  and  through  the body.

Cardiomyocytes are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle; adjacent cells are connected by intercalated disks found only in cardiac muscle. These connections allow the electrical signal to travel directly to neighboring muscle cells.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_610.jpg"/></span><br/>The electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes.

The main artery of the systemic circulation is the aorta; it branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs. The aorta and arteries near the heart have heavy but elastic walls that respond to and smooth out the pressure differences caused by the beating heart. Arteries farther away from the heart have more muscle tissue in their walls that can constrict to affect flow rates of blood. The major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and then smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body.<br/>Arterioles diverge into capillary beds. Capillary beds contain a large number, 10’s to 100’s of <b>capillaries </b>that branch among the cells of the body. Capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit single red blood cells and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level.

Hormones circulate throughout the body and stimulate a response in cells that have receptors able to bind with them. The changes brought about in the receiving cells affect the functioning of the organ system to which they belong. Many of the hormones are secreted in response to signals from the nervous system, thus the two systems act in concert to effect changes in the body.</p><p class="s24">Hormones</p><p>Maintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs. One mechanism of communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals called hormones. <b>Hormones </b>are released into body fluids, usually blood, which carries them to their target cells where they elicit a response. The cells that secrete hormones are often located in specific organs, called <b>endocrine glands</b>, and the cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system. Examples of endocrine organs include the pancreas, which produces the hormones insulin and glucagon to regulate blood-glucose levels, the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses to stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="462" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_614.png"/></span><br/>The endocrine glands differ from the exocrine glands. <b>Exocrine glands </b>secrete chemicals through ducts that lead outside the gland (not to the blood). For example, sweat produced by sweat glands is released into ducts that carry sweat to the surface of the skin. The pancreas has both endocrine and exocrine functions because besides releasing hormones into the blood. It also produces digestive juices, which are carried by ducts into the small intestine.</p><p class="s16">Endocrinologist</p><p>An  endocrinologist is  a  medical   doctor  who  specializes in  treating   endocrine disorders. An  endocrine surgeon specializes in the surgical  treatment of endocrine diseases and  glands. Some of the diseases that are  managed by endocrinologists include  disorders of the  pancreas (diabetes mellitus),  disorders of the pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and  pituitary dwarfism),  disorders of the thyroid gland  (goiter and  Graves’ disease), and disorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing’s disease  and Addison’s disease).<br/>Endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through  extensive use  of laboratory tests. Many endocrine diseases are  diagnosed using  tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine organ  functioning.  Blood samples are  then  drawn  to determine the effect of stimulating  or suppressing an endocrine organ  on the production of hormones. For example, to diagnose diabetes mellitus,  patients are required to fast  for 12 to 24 hours.  They  are  then  given  a sugary drink, which stimulates the  pancreas to produce insulin to decrease  blood-glucose levels.  A blood sample is taken  one  to two hours  after the sugar drink is consumed. If the  pancreas is functioning  properly,  the  blood-glucose level will be  within a normal range. Another  example is the  A1C test,  which can  be  performed during  blood  screening. The  A1C test measures  average blood-glucose levels  over the past  two to three  months. The A1C test  is an indicator  of how well blood glucose is being managed over a long time.<br/>Once  a disease such  as diabetes has  been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and medications to treat the disease. Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and  a healthy  diet; in other  cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin’s production or effect. If the disease cannot be controlled  by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections.<br/>In addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also  be involved in primary research and  development activities.  For example, ongoing  islet transplant research is investigating how healthy  pancreas islet cells may  be  transplanted into diabetic  patients. Successful islet transplants may  allow patients to stop  taking insulin injections.</p><p class="s24">How Hormones Work</p><p>Hormones cause changes in target cells by binding to specific cell-surface or <b>intracellular hormone receptors</b>, molecules embedded in the cell membrane or floating in the cytoplasm with a binding site that matches a binding site on the hormone molecule. In this way, even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on or in many different cells or may be limited to a small number of specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity throughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the</p><p class="s20">422                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p>same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of hormones. The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cell’s sensitivity to that hormone, and the resulting cellular response. Additionally, the number of receptors available to respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity. In <b>up-regulation</b>, the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels, making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity. When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels, called <b>down-regulation</b>, cellular activity is reduced.</p><p class="s24">Endocrine Glands</p><p>The endocrine glands secrete hormones into the surrounding interstitial fluid; those hormones then diffuse into blood and are carried to various organs and tissues within the body. The endocrine glands include the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands, gonads, pineal, and pancreas.<br/>The <b>pituitary gland</b>, sometimes called the hypophysis, is located at the base of the brain (<span class="s32">Figure 16.13</span><b>a</b>). It is attached to the hypothalamus. The posterior lobe stores and releases oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone produced by the hypothalamus. The anterior lobe responds to hormones produced by the hypothalamus by producing its own hormones, most of which regulate other hormone-producing glands.<br/><span><IMG width="527" height="512" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_615.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 16.13  <span class="s30">(a) The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain, just above the brain stem.

Growth hormone stimulates cellular activities like protein synthesis that promote growth. Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands. The other hormones produced by the anterior pituitary regulate the production of hormones by other endocrine tissues (<span class="s32">Table 16.1</span>).

It is a part of the brain, extending down from the hypothalamus, and contains mostly nerve fibers that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary.<br/>The <b>thyroid gland </b>is located in the neck, just below the larynx and in front of the trachea (<span class="s32">Figure 16.13</span><b>b</b>). It is a butterfly- shaped gland with two lobes that are connected. The thyroid follicle cells synthesize the hormone thyroxine, which is also known as T<span class="s54">4 </span>because it contains four atoms of iodine, and triiodothyronine, also known as T<span class="s54">3 </span>because it contains three atoms of iodine. T<span class="s54">3 </span>and T<span class="s54">4 </span>are released by the thyroid in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary, and both T<span class="s54">3 </span>and T<span class="s54">4 </span>have the effect of stimulating metabolic activity in the body and increasing energy use. A third hormone, calcitonin, is also produced by the thyroid. Calcitonin is released in response to rising calcium ion concentrations in the blood and has the effect of reducing those levels.<br/>Most people have four <b>parathyroid glands</b>; however, the number can vary from two to six. These glands are located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland (<span class="s32">Figure 16.13</span><b>b</b>).<br/>The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium concentrations when calcium ion levels fall below normal.<br/>The <b>adrenal glands </b>are located on top of each kidney (<span class="s32">Figure 16.13</span><b>c</b>). The adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla. These regions secrete different hormones.<br/>The adrenal cortex produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. The main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which regulates the concentration of ions in urine, sweat, and saliva. Aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a decrease in blood concentrations of sodium ions, blood volume, or blood pressure, or by an increase in blood potassium levels. The glucocorticoids maintain proper blood-glucose levels between meals. They also control a response to stress by increasing glucose synthesis from fats and proteins and interact with epinephrine to cause vasoconstriction. Androgens are sex hormones that are produced in small amounts by the adrenal cortex. They do not normally affect sexual characteristics and may supplement sex hormones released from the gonads. The adrenal medulla contains two types of secretory cells: one that produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and another that produces norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Epinephrine and norepinephrine cause immediate, short-term changes in response to stressors, inducing the so-called fight- or-flight response. The responses include increased heart rate, breathing rate, cardiac muscle contractions, and blood- glucose levels. They also accelerate the breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats in adipose tissue, and redirect blood flow toward skeletal muscles and away from skin and viscera. The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous system that originate from the hypothalamus.<br/>The <b>pancreas </b>is an elongate organ located between the stomach and the proximal portion of the small intestine (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">16.13<span style=" color: #000;">d</span><span class="p">). It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones.</span></p><p>The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans. Among the cell types in each pancreatic islet are the alpha cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, and the beta cells, which produce the hormone insulin. These hormones regulate blood-glucose levels. Alpha cells release glucagon as blood-glucose levels decline. When blood-glucose levels rise, beta cells release insulin. Glucagon causes the release of glucose to the blood from the liver, and insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose by the body’s cells.<br/>The gonads—the male testes and female ovaries—produce steroid hormones. The testes produce androgens, testosterone being the most prominent, which allow for the development of secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm cells. The ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone, which cause secondary sex characteristics, regulate production of eggs, control pregnancy, and prepare the body for childbirth.<br/>There are several organs whose primary functions are non-endocrine but that also possess endocrine functions. These include the heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, and adipose tissue. The heart has endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that release a hormone in response to increased blood volume. It causes a reduction in blood volume and blood pressure, and reduces the concentration of Na<span class="s54">+ </span>in the blood.<br/>The gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion. The endocrine cells are located in the mucosa of the GI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine. They trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the GI tract.<br/>The kidneys also possess endocrine function. Two of these hormones regulate ion concentrations and blood volume or pressure. Erythropoietin (EPO) is released by kidneys in response to low oxygen levels. EPO triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance. But EPO doping has its risks, since it thickens the blood and increases strain on the heart; it also increases the risk of blood clots and therefore heart attacks and stroke.</p><p class="s20">424                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p>The <b>thymus </b>is found behind the sternum.

Leptin produces a feeling of satiety after eating, reducing the urge for further eating.<br/><span><IMG width="2" height="47" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_616.png"/></span></p><p class="s60">Endocrine Glands and Their Associated Hormones</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s61">Endocrine       Associated</p><p class="s61">Gland                Hormones                                                           Effect</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pituitary</p><p class="s19">(anterior)</p></td><td><p class="s19">growth hormone      promotes growth of body tissues</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pituitary</p><p class="s19">(anterior)</p></td><td><p class="s19">prolactin                      promotes milk production</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pituitary</p><p class="s19">(anterior)</p></td><td><p class="s19">thyroid-stimulating hormone</p></td><td><p class="s19">stimulates thyroid hormone release</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pituitary</p><p class="s19">(anterior)</p></td><td><p class="s19">adrenocorticotropic hormone</p></td><td><p class="s19">stimulates hormone release by adrenal cortex</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pituitary</p><p class="s19">(anterior)</p></td><td><p class="s19">follicle-stimulating hormone</p></td><td><p class="s19">stimulates gamete production</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pituitary</p><p class="s19">(anterior)</p></td><td><p class="s19">luteinizing hormone</p></td><td><p class="s19">stimulates androgen production by gonads in males; stimulates ovulation and production of estrogen and progesterone in females</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pituitary</p><p class="s19">(posterior)</p></td><td><p class="s19">antidiuretic  hormone</p></td><td><p class="s19">stimulates water reabsorption by kidneys</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pituitary</p><p class="s19">(posterior)</p></td><td><p class="s19">oxytocin                      stimulates uterine  contractions during childbirth</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Thyroid</p></td><td><p class="s19">thyroxine,  triiodothyronine</p></td><td><p class="s19">stimulate metabolism</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Thyroid</p></td><td><p class="s19">calcitonin                    reduces blood Ca<span class="s80">2+ </span>levels</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Parathyroid</p></td><td><p class="s19">parathyroid hormone</p></td><td><p class="s19">increases blood Ca<span class="s80">2+ </span>levels</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Adrenal</p><p class="s19">(cortex)</p></td><td><p class="s19">aldosterone             increases blood Na<span class="s80">+  </span>levels</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Adrenal</p><p class="s19">(cortex)</p></td><td><p class="s19">cortisol, corticosterone, cortisone</p></td><td><p class="s19">increase blood-glucose levels</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Adrenal</p><p class="s19">(medulla)</p></td><td><p class="s19">epinephrine, norepinephrine</p></td><td><p class="s19">stimulate fight-or-flight response</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pancreas</p></td><td><p class="s19">insulin                         reduces blood-glucose levels</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Pancreas</p></td><td><p class="s19">glucagon</p></td><td><p class="s19">increases blood-glucose levels</p></td></tr></table><p><span><IMG width="2" height="24" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_617.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="2" height="28" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_618.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="2" height="28" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_619.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="2" height="24" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_620.png"/></span></p><p class="s17">Table 16.1</p><p class="s24">Regulation of Hormone Production</p><p>Hormone  production  and  release  are  primarily  controlled  by  negative  feedback,  as  described  in  the  discussion  on homeostasis.

The bones of the skeleton protect the body’s internal organs and support the weight of the body. The muscles of the muscular system contract and pull on the bones, allowing for movements as diverse as standing, walking, running, and grasping items.<br/>Injury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be very debilitating. The most common musculoskeletal diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition, which can negatively affect development and maintenance of bones and muscles. Other diseases affect the joints, such as arthritis, which can make movement difficult and, in advanced cases, completely impair mobility.<br/>Progress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the development of artificial joints, with joint replacement surgery in the hips and knees being the most common. Replacement joints for shoulders, elbows, and fingers are also available.</p><p class="s24">Skeletal System</p><p><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_623.jpg"/></span><br/>The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones in the adult. An endoskeleton develops within the body rather than outside like the exoskeleton of insects. The skeleton has five main functions: providing support to the body, storing minerals and lipids, producing blood cells, protecting internal organs, and allowing for movement. The skeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage), and the appendicular skeleton (which consists of limb bones, the pectoral or shoulder girdle, and the pelvic girdle).<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_624.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/human_skeleton" class="s25">Explore the human skeleton by viewing the following </a>video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/human_skeleton) <span class="p">with digital</span></p><p>3D sculpturing.<br/>The <b>axial skeleton </b>forms the central axis of the body and includes the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear, hyoid bone of the throat, vertebral column, and the thoracic cage (rib cage) (<span class="s32">Figure 16.15</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  427</p><p><span><IMG width="353" height="659" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_625.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  16.15  <span class="s30">The  axial skeleton, shown  in blue,  consists of the  bones of the  skull, ossicles of the  middle  ear,  hyoid bone, vertebral column,  and  thoracic  cage.

The skull consists of cranial bones and facial bones. The cranial bones form the cranial cavity, which encloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for muscles of the head and neck. In the adult they are tightly jointed with connective tissue and adjoining bones do not move.<br/>The <b>auditory ossicles </b>of the middle ear transmit sounds from the air as vibrations to the fluid-filled cochlea. The auditory ossicles consist of two malleus (hammer) bones, two incus (anvil) bones, and two stapes (stirrups), one on each side. Facial bones provide cavities for the sense organs (eyes, mouth, and nose), and serve as attachment points for facial muscles.<br/>The <b>hyoid bone </b>lies below the mandible in the front of the neck. It acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw, larynx, and tongue. The mandible forms a joint with the base of the skull. The mandible controls the opening to the mouth and hence, the airway and gut.</p><p class="s20">428                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p>The <b>vertebral column</b>, or spinal column, surrounds and protects the spinal cord, supports the head, and acts as an attachment point for ribs and muscles of the back and neck. It consists of 26 bones: the 24 vertebrae, the sacrum, and the coccyx. Each vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the spinal cord passes down to the level of the first lumbar vertebra. Below this level, the hole contains spinal nerves which exit between the vertebrae. There is a notch on each side of the hole through which the spinal nerves, can exit from the spinal cord to serve different regions of the body. The vertebral column is approximately 70 cm (28 in) in adults and is curved, which can be seen from a side view.<br/>Intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebrae from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum. Each disc helps form a slightly moveable joint and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running.<br/>The <b>thoracic cage</b>, also known as the rib cage consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic vertebrae, and costal cartilages. The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity including the heart and lungs. It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs and serves as the attachment point for the diaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders. Changes in the volume of the thorax enable breathing. The sternum, or breastbone, is a long flat bone located at the anterior of the chest. Like the skull, it is formed from many bones in the embryo, which fuse in the adult. The ribs are 12 pairs of long curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body, forming the ribcage. Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of most ribs to the sternum.<br/>The <b>appendicular skeleton </b>is composed of the bones of the upper and lower limbs. It also includes the pectoral, or shoulder girdle, which attaches the upper limbs to the body, and the pelvic girdle, which attaches the lower limbs to the body (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">16.15<span class="p">).</span></p><p>The <b>pectoral girdle </b>bones transfer force generated by muscles acting on the upper limb to the thorax. It consists of the clavicles (or collarbones) in the anterior, and the scapulae (or shoulder blades) in the posterior.<br/>The upper limb contains bones of the arm (shoulder to elbow), the forearm, and the hand. The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb. It forms a joint with the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow. The forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones. The hand includes the bones of the wrist, the palm, and the bones of the fingers.<br/>The <b>pelvic girdle </b>attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton. Since it is responsible for bearing the weight of the body and for locomotion, the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong ligaments. It also has deep sockets with robust ligaments that securely attach to the femur. The pelvic girdle is mainly composed of two large hip bones. The hip bones join together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior of the body.<br/>The lower limb consists of the thigh, the leg, and the foot. The bones of the lower limbs are thicker and stronger than the bones of the upper limbs to support the entire weight of the body and the forces from locomotion. The femur, or thighbone, is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the body. The femur and pelvis form the hip joint. At its other end, the femur, along with the shinbone and kneecap, form the knee joint.</p><p class="s24">Joints and Skeletal Movement</p><p>The point at which two or more bones meet is called a <b>joint</b>, or articulation. Joints are responsible for movement, such as the movement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull.<br/>There are two ways to classify joints: based on their structure or based on their function. The structural classification divides joints into fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing the joint and the presence or absence of a cavity in the joint. The bones of <b>fibrous joints </b>are held together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or space, present between the bones, so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. The joints between the bones in the skull and between the teeth and the bone of their sockets are examples of fibrous joints (<span class="s32">Figure 16.16</span><b>a</b>).</p><p class="s27">Cartilaginous joints <span class="p">are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage (</span><span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 16.16</span>b<span class="p">). An example is found at the joints between vertebrae, the so-called “disks” of the backbone. Cartilaginous joints allow for very little movement.</span></p><p class="s27">Synovial joints <span class="p">are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones (</span><span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 16.16</span>c<span class="p">). This space is referred to as the joint cavity and is filled with fluid. The fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with cartilage and the entire joint is surrounded by a capsule. Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of the joint types. Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints.</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  429</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="200" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_626.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  16.16  <span class="s30">(a) Sutures are  fibrous  joints found  only in the  skull. (b) Cartilaginous joints are  bones connected by cartilage, such  as between vertebrae.

Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. Flexion, or bending, occurs when the angle between the bones decreases. Moving the forearm upward at the elbow is an example of flexion. Extension is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between the bones of a joint increases. Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis. Movement of the head as in saying “no” is an example of rotation.</p><p class="s16">Rheumatologist</p><p>Rheumatologists are  medical  doctors who  specialize in the  diagnosis and  treatment of disorders of the joints, muscles, and  bones. They diagnose and  treat  diseases such  as arthritis, musculoskeletal disorders, osteoporosis, plus autoimmune diseases like ankylosing spondylitis,  a chronic  spinal  inflammatory  disease and rheumatoid arthritis.<br/>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory  disorder that primarily affects  synovial joints of the hands, feet, and  cervical  spine. Affected  joints  become swollen,  stiff, and  painful.  Although  it is known  that  RA is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune  system mistakenly attacks healthy  tissue, the exact  cause of RA remains unknown.  Immune  cells  from the  blood  enter  joints and  the  joint capsule causing cartilage breakdown and  swelling of the joint lining. Breakdown of cartilage causes bones to rub against each other causing pain.  RA is more  common in women  than  men  and  the  age  of onset is usually  between 40 to 50 years.<br/>Rheumatologists can diagnose RA based on symptoms such  as joint inflammation  and pain, x-ray and MRI imaging,  and  blood  tests. Arthrography is a type  of medical  imaging  of joints that  uses a contrast agent, such  as a dye  that  is opaque to x-rays.  This allows  the  soft tissue structures of joints—such as cartilage, tendons, and ligaments—to be visualized. An arthrogram differs from a regular  x-ray by showing  the surface of soft tissues lining the joint in addition to joint bones. An arthrogram allows early degenerative changes in joint cartilage to be detected before  bones become affected.<br/>There  is currently  no cure  for RA; however, rheumatologists have  a number of treatment options  available. Treatments are  divided  into those that  reduce the  symptoms of the  disease and  those that  reduce the damage to bone  and  cartilage caused by the disease. Early stages can  be treated with rest  of the affected joints  through   the  use   of  a  cane, or  with  joint  splints  that  minimize  inflammation.   When  inflammation has   decreased,  exercise can  be  used to  strengthen muscles that  surround the  joint  and  to  maintain joint flexibility. If joint damage is more  extensive, medications can  be  used to relieve  pain  and  decrease inflammation.   Anti-inflammatory   drugs   that   may   be   used  include   aspirin,   topical   pain   relievers, and corticosteroid injections.   Surgery may  be  required in cases where   joint damage is  severe.  Physicians are  now  using  drugs  that  reduce the  damage to bones and  cartilage caused by the  disease to slow  its development. These drugs  are  diverse in their  mechanisms but  they  all act  to reduce the  impact  of the autoimmune response, for example by inhibiting the  inflammatory  response or reducing the  number of T lymphocytes, a cell of the immune  system.</p><p class="s20">430                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p class="s24">Muscles</p><p>Muscles allow for movement such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily processes such as respiration and digestion.

The cells of skeletal muscle are long and tapered and have multiple nuclei on the periphery of each cell.</span></p><p class="s27">Smooth muscle tissue <span class="p">occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and around passages such as in the respiratory tract and blood vessels.

Within each muscle fiber are <b>myofibrils</b>, long cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber. Myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber. They attach to the plasma membrane, called the <b>sarcolemma</b>, at their ends, so that as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell contracts (<span class="s32">Figure 16.18</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="503" height="211" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_629.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  16.18  <span class="s30">A skeletal muscle fiber is surrounded by a plasma membrane called  the sarcolemma, with a cytoplasm called the sarcoplasm.

The primary component of thin filaments is the protein actin.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_630.jpg"/></span><br/>The thick and thin filaments alternate with each other in a structure called a <b>sarcomere</b>. The sarcomere is the unit of contraction in a muscle cell. Contraction is stimulated by an electrochemical signal from a nerve cell associated with the muscle fiber. For a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten. However, thick and thin filaments do not shorten. Instead, they slide by one another, causing the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain the same length. The sliding is accomplished when a molecular extension of myosin, called the myosin head, temporarily binds to an actin filament next to it and through a change in conformation, bends, dragging the two filaments in opposite directions. The myosin head then releases its actin filament, relaxes, and then repeats the process, dragging the two filaments further along each other. The combined activity of many binding sites and repeated movements within the sarcomere causes it to contract. The coordinated contractions of many sarcomeres in a myofibril leads to contraction of the entire muscle cell and ultimately the muscle itself. The movement of the myosin head requires ATP, which provides the energy for the contraction.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_631.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/skeletal_muscl2" class="s25">View this </a>animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/skeletal_muscl2) <span class="p">to see how muscle fibers are organized.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_632.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">16.6 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Nervous System</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the form and function of a neuron<br/>•   Describe the basic parts and functions of the central nervous system<br/>•   Describe the basic parts and functions of the peripheral nervous system<br/>As you read this, your nervous system is performing several functions simultaneously. The visual system is processing what is seen on the page; the motor system controls your eye movements and the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous system. The nervous system is one of two systems that exert control over all the organ systems of the body; the other is the endocrine system. The nervous system’s control is much more specific and rapid than the hormonal system. It communicates signals through cells and the tiny gaps between them rather than through the circulatory system as in the endocrine system. It uses a combination of chemical and electrochemical signals, rather than purely chemical signals used by the endocrine system to cover long distances quickly. The nervous system acquires information from sensory organs, processes it and then may initiate a response either through motor function, leading to movement, or in a change in the organism’s physiological state.<br/>Nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity. Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net.” Flatworms have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a ganglion (clusters of connected neurons) and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body. The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized. It contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia. These ganglia can control movements and behaviors without input from the brain.<br/>Compared to invertebrates, vertebrate nervous systems are more complex, centralized, and specialized. While there is great diversity among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic structure: a CNS that contains a brain and spinal cord and a PNS made up of peripheral sensory and motor nerves. One interesting difference between the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords of many invertebrates are located ventrally (toward the stomach) whereas the vertebrate spinal cords are located dorsally (toward the back). There is debate among evolutionary biologists</p><p class="s20">432                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p>as to whether these different nervous system plans evolved separately or whether the invertebrate body plan arrangement somehow “flipped” during the evolution of vertebrates.<br/>The nervous system is made up of <b>neurons</b>, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and <b>glia</b>, cells that provide support functions for the neurons. There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system.</p><p class="s24">Neurons and Glial Cells</p><p>The nervous system of the common laboratory fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same number as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain contains around 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same behaviors—from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates. The ability of neurons to communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.<br/>Most neurons share the same cellular components. But neurons are also highly specialized—different types of neurons have different sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.<br/>Like other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components. Neurons also contain unique structures for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make communication between neurons possible (<span class="s32">Figure 16.19</span>). <b>Dendrites </b>are tree-like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called <b>synapses</b>. Although some neurons do not have any dendrites, most have one or many dendrites.<br/>The bilayer lipid membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through ion channels that span the membrane. Some ion channels need to be activated to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential.<br/>A neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside (–70 mV). This voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell and the selective permeability created by ion channels. Sodium-potassium pumps in the membrane produce the different ion concentrations inside and outside of the cell by bringing in two K<span class="s54">+ </span>ions and removing three Na<span class="s54">+ </span>ions. The actions of this pump are costly: one molecule of ATP is used up for each turn. Up to 50 percent of a neuron’s ATP is used in maintaining its membrane resting potential. Potassium ions (K<span class="s54">+</span>), which are higher inside the cell, move fairly freely out of the neuron through potassium channels; this loss of positive charge produces a net negative charge inside the cell. Sodium ions (Na<span class="s54">+</span>), which are low inside, have a driving force to enter but move less freely. Their channels are voltage dependent and will open when a slight change in the membrane potential triggers them.<br/>A neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons. Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical, called a neurotransmitter, which diffuses from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of a second neuron. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron’s dendrites, the neurotransmitter opens ion channels in the dendrite’s plasma membrane. This opening allows sodium ions to enter the neuron and results in <b>depolarization </b>of the membrane—a decrease in the voltage across the neuron membrane. Once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body. A large enough signal from neurotransmitters will reach the axon. If it is strong enough (that is, if the <b>threshold of excitation</b>, a depolarization to around –60mV is reached), then depolarization creates a positive feedback loop: as more Na<span class="s54">+ </span>ions enter the cell, the axon becomes further depolarized, opening even more sodium channels at further distances from the cell body. This will cause voltage dependent Na<span class="s54">+ </span>channels further down the axon to open and more positive ions to enter the cell. In the axon, this “signal” will become a self-propagating brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an <b>action potential</b>.<br/>An action potential is an all-or-nothing event; it either happens or it does not. The threshold of excitation must be reached for the neuron to “fire” an action potential. As sodium ions rush into the cell, depolarization actually reverses the charge across the membrane form -70mv to +30mV. This change in the membrane potential causes voltage-gated K<span class="s54">+ </span>channels to open, and K<span class="s54">+ </span>begins to leave the cell, repolarizing it. At the same time, Na<span class="s54">+ </span>channels inactivate so no more Na<span class="s54">+ </span>enters the cell. K<span class="s54">+ </span>ions continue to leave the cell and the membrane potential returns to the resting potential. At the resting potential, the K<span class="s54">+ </span>channels close and Na<span class="s54">+ </span>channels reset. The depolarization of the membrane proceeds in a wave down the length of the axon. It travels in only one direction because the sodium channels have been inactivated and unavailable until the membrane potential is near the resting potential again; at this point they are reset to closed and can be opened again.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  433</p><p>An <b>axon </b>is a tube-like structure that propagates the signal from the cell body to specialized endings called axon terminals. These terminals in turn then synapse with other neurons, muscle, or target organs. When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, this causes the release of neurotransmitter onto the dendrite of another neuron. Neurotransmitters released at axon terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells, and the process begins again. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons do not contain any axons.<br/>Some axons are covered with a special structure called a <b>myelin sheath</b>, which acts as an insulator to keep the electrical signal from dissipating as it travels down the axon. This insulation is important, as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter (3.2 ft)—from the base of the spine to the toes. The myelin sheath is produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath. These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is “recharged” as it travels along the axon.<br/>It is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone—neuronal communication depends on the connections that neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive synaptic contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.<br/><span><IMG width="500" height="338" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_633.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 16.19  <span class="s30">Neurons contain  organelles common to other cells, such  as a nucleus and mitochondria.

Research performed during  the  last  few decades indicates that  neurogenesis, the  birth of new  neurons, continues into adulthood. Neurogenesis was  first discovered in songbirds that  produce new  neurons while learning songs. For  mammals, new  neurons also  play  an  important  role  in learning:   about  1,000  new  neurons develop in the  hippocampus (a brain  structure involved in learning  and  memory)  each day.  While most  of the  new  neurons will die,  researchers found  that  an  increase in the  number of surviving  new  neurons in the  hippocampus correlated with how well rats  learned a new  task.  Interestingly, both  exercise and  some antidepressant medications also promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Stress has  the opposite effect. While neurogenesis is quite  limited compared to regeneration in other  tissues, research in this area may lead to new treatments for disorders such  as Alzheimer’s, stroke,  and epilepsy.<br/>How do  scientists identify new  neurons? A researcher can  inject  a  compound called  bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the  brain  of an  animal.  While all cells  will be  exposed to BrdU, BrdU will only be  incorporated into the  DNA of newly generated cells  that  are  in S phase. A technique called  immunohistochemistry can be  used to  attach a  fluorescent label  to  the  incorporated BrdU,  and  a  researcher can  use  fluorescent microscopy to visualize  the presence of BrdU, and thus new neurons, in brain tissue (<span class="s32">Figure 16.20</span>).</p><p class="s29">Figure  16.20  <span class="s30">This image  shows new neurons in a rat hippocampus.

Neurons communicate between the axon of one neuron and the dendrites, and sometimes the cell body, of another neuron across the gap between them, known as the <b>synaptic cleft</b>. When an action potential reaches the end of an axon it stimulates the release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft between the synaptic knob of the axon and the post-synaptic membrane of the dendrite or soma of the next cell. The neurotransmitter is released through exocytosis of vesicles containing the neurotransmitter molecules. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors in the post-synaptic membrane. These receptor molecules are chemically regulated ion channels and will open, allowing sodium to enter the cell. If sufficient neurotransmitter has been released an action potential may be initiated in the next cell, but this is not guaranteed. If  insufficient  neurotransmitter  is  released  the  nerve  signal  will  die  at  this  point.  There  are  a  number  of  different neurotransmitters that are specific to neuron types that have specific functions.</p><p class="s24">The Central Nervous System</p><p>The <b>central nervous system (CNS) </b>is made up of the brain and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called <b>meninges </b>(“meninges” is derived from the Greek and means “membranes”) (<span class="s32">Figure 16.21</span>). The outermost layer is the dura mater, the middle layer is the web-like arachnoid mater, and the inner layer is the pia mater, which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord. The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with <b>cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</b>. The brain floats in CSF, which acts as a cushion and shock absorber.<br/><span><IMG width="360" height="287" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_637.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 16.21  <span class="s30">The cerebral cortex is covered by three  layers  of meninges: the dura,  arachnoid, and pia maters.

It includes the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, and retinas. The outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the <b>cerebral cortex</b>. The cerebral cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia make up the two cerebral hemispheres. A thick fiber bundle called the <b>corpus callosum </b>(corpus = “body”; callosum = “tough”) connects the two hemispheres. Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do suffer some deficits following the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very immature nervous systems.<br/>In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes a condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres.

This is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to the speech center, which generally is found in the left side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked to pick up a specific object out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still be unable to verbally identify it.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_639.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/split-brain2" class="s25">Visit the following </a>website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/split-brain2) <span class="p">to learn more about split-brain patients and to play a game where you can model split-brain experiments yourself.</span></p><p>Each hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions. Each hemisphere of the mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital (<span class="s32">Figure 16.22</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="360" height="264" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_640.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 16.22  <span class="s30">The human cerebral cortex  includes the frontal, parietal,  temporal, and occipital lobes.</span></p><p>The <b>frontal lobe </b>is located at the front of the brain, over the eyes. This lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which processes smells. The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex, which is important for planning and implementing movement. Areas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups. Neurons in the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention, speech, and decision-making. Studies of humans who have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality, socialization, and assessing risk. The <b>parietal lobe </b>is located at the top of the brain. Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading. Two of the parietal lobe’s main functions are processing somatosensation—touch sensations like pressure, pain, heat, cold—and processing proprioception—the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space. The parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex. The <b>occipital lobe </b>is located at the back of the brain. It is primarily involved in vision—seeing, recognizing, and identifying the visual world. The <b>temporal lobe </b>is located at the base of the brain and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds. It also contains the <b>hippocampus </b>(named from the Greek for “seahorse,” which it resembles in shape) a structure that processes memory formation. The role of the hippocampus in memory was partially determined by studying one famous epileptic patient, HM, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His seizures went away, but he could no longer form new memories (although he could remember some facts from before his surgery and could learn new motor tasks).<br/>Interconnected brain areas called the <b>basal ganglia </b>play important roles in movement control and posture. The basal ganglia also regulate motivation.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  437</p><p>The <b>thalamus </b>acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states.<br/>Below the thalamus is the <b>hypothalamus</b>. The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland. Among other functions, the hypothalamus is the body’s thermostat—it makes sure the body temperature is kept at appropriate levels. Neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.<br/>The <b>limbic system </b>is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation. It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus. One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the <b>amygdala</b>. The two amygdala (one on each side) are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces.<br/>The <b>cerebellum </b>(cerebellum = “little brain”) sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks. The cerebellum of birds is large compared to other vertebrates because of the coordination required by flight.<br/>The <b>brainstem </b>connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord and regulates some of the most important and basic functions of the nervous system including breathing, swallowing, digestion, sleeping, walking, and sensory and motor information integration.</p><p class="s24">Spinal  cord</p><p>Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord. The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body. The spinal cord is contained within the meninges and the bones of the vertebral column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral nervous system). A cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape (<span class="s32">Figure 16.23</span>). Axons make up the “white matter” and neuron and glia cell bodies (and interneurons) make up the “gray matter.” Axons and cell bodies in the dorsa spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. Axons and cell bodies in the spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body.<br/>The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are quick, unconscious movements—like automatically removing a hand from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections. For example, the knee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. While a reflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).<br/><span><IMG width="360" height="203" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_641.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 16.23  <span class="s30">A cross-section of the spinal cord shows gray matter  (containing cell bodies and interneurons) and white matter  (containing myelinated axons).</span></p><p class="s24">The Peripheral Nervous System</p><p>The <b>peripheral nervous system (PNS) </b>is the connection between the central nervous system and the rest of the body.

There are two divisions of the autonomic nervous system that often have opposing effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.<br/>The <b>sympathetic nervous system </b>is responsible for the immediate responses an animal makes when it encounters a dangerous situation. One way to remember this is to think of the “fight-or-flight” response a person feels when encountering a snake (“snake” and “sympathetic” both begin with “s”). Examples of functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion. These functions help prepare an organism’s body for the physical strain required to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a predator.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  439</p><p><span><IMG width="503" height="487" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_643.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 16.25  <span class="s30">The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems often have  opposing effects  on target  organs.</span></p><p>While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations, the <b>parasympathetic nervous system </b>allows an animal to “rest and digest.” One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic, the parasympathetic nervous system is in control (“picnic” and “parasympathetic” both start with “p”). Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral (toward the bottom) spinal cord (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">16.25<span class="p">). The parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated including slowing of heart rate, lowered blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion.</span></p><p>The sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons. Sensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal muscle, and sensory organs to the CNS. Motor neurons transmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to make them contract. Without its sensory- somatic nervous system, an animal would be unable to process any information about its environment (what it sees, feels, hears, and so on) and could not control motor movements. Unlike the autonomic nervous system, which usually has two synapses between the CNS and the target organ, sensory and motor neurons usually have only one synapse—one ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other directly contacts a CNS neuron.</p><p class="s20">440

class="s52">16.1 Homeostasis and Osmoregulation</p><p>Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium that is maintained in body tissues and organs. It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the systems encounter. It is an equilibrium because body functions are kept within a normal range, with some fluctuations around a set point. The kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems; they function to filter blood and maintain the dissolved ion concentrations of body fluids. They are made up internally of three distinct regions—the cortex, medulla, and pelvis. The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively filters blood and generates urine. The urine leaves the kidney through the ureter and is stored in the urinary bladder. Urine is voided from the body through the urethra.</p><p class="s52">16.2 Digestive System</p><p>There are many organs that work together to digest food and absorb nutrients. The mouth is the point of ingestion and the location where both mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. Saliva contains an enzyme called amylase that breaks down carbohydrates. The food bolus travels through the esophagus by peristaltic movements to the stomach. The stomach has an extremely acidic environment. The enzyme pepsin digests protein in the stomach. Further digestion and absorption take place in the small intestine. The large intestine reabsorbs water from the undigested food and stores waste until elimination.<br/>Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the primary components of food. Some essential nutrients are required for cellular function but cannot be produced by the animal body. These include vitamins, minerals, some fatty acids, and some amino acids. Food intake in more than necessary amounts is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells, and in adipose tissue. Excess adipose storage can lead to obesity and serious health problems.</p><p class="s52">16.3 Circulatory  and Respiratory Systems</p><p>Animal respiratory systems are designed to facilitate gas exchange. In mammals, air is warmed and humidified in the nasal cavity. Air then travels down the pharynx and larynx, through the trachea, and into the lungs. In the lungs, air passes<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems                                                                                                                                                                                  445</p><p>through the branching bronchi, reaching the respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles open up into the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. Because there are so many alveoli and alveolar sacs in the lung, the surface area for gas exchange is very large.<br/>The mammalian circulatory system is a closed system with double circulation passing through the lungs and the body. It consists of a network of vessels containing blood that circulates because of pressure differences generated by the heart.<br/>The heart contains two pumps that move blood through the pulmonary and systemic circulations. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The pumping of the heart is a function of cardiomyocytes, distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle. The signal for contraction begins in the wall of the right atrium. The electrochemical signal causes the two atria to contract in unison; then the signal causes the ventricles to contract. The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels; arteries take blood away from the heart, and veins bring blood back to the heart.</p><p class="s52">16.4 Endocrine System</p><p>Hormones cause cellular changes by binding to receptors on or in target cells. The number of receptors on a target cell can increase or decrease in response to hormone activity.<br/>Hormone levels are primarily controlled through negative feedback, in which rising levels of a hormone inhibit its further release.<br/>The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain. The anterior pituitary receives signals from the hypothalamus and produces six hormones. The posterior pituitary is an extension of the brain and releases hormones (antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin) produced by the hypothalamus. The thyroid gland is located in the neck and is composed of two lobes. The thyroid produces the hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. The thyroid also produces calcitonin. The parathyroid glands lie on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland and produce parathyroid hormone.<br/>The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and consist of the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex produces the corticosteroids, glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The adrenal medulla is the inner part of the adrenal gland and produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.<br/>The pancreas lies in the abdomen between the stomach and the small intestine. Clusters of endocrine cells in the pancreas form the islets of Langerhans, which contain alpha cells that release glucagon and beta cells that release insulin. Some organs possess endocrine activity as a secondary function but have another primary function. The heart produces the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide, which functions to reduce blood volume, pressure, and Na<span class="s54">+ </span>concentration. The gastrointestinal tract produces various hormones that aid in digestion. The kidneys produce erythropoietin. The thymus produces hormones that aid in the development of the immune system. The gonads produce steroid hormones, including testosterone in males and estrogen and progesterone in females. Adipose tissue produces leptin, which promotes satiety signals in the brain.</p><p class="s52">16.5 Musculoskeletal System</p><p>The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that is composed of the axial and appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is composed of the bones of the skull, ossicles of the ear, hyoid bone, vertebral column, and ribcage. The skull consists of eight cranial bones and 14 facial bones. Six bones make up the ossicles of the middle ear, while the hyoid bone is located in the neck under the mandible. The vertebral column contains 26 bones and surrounds and protects the spinal cord. The thoracic cage consists of the sternum, ribs, thoracic vertebrae, and costal cartilages. The appendicular skeleton is made up of the upper and lower limbs. The pectoral girdle is composed of the clavicles and the scapulae. The upper limb contains<br/>30 bones in the arm, the forearm, and the hand. The pelvic girdle attaches the lower limbs to the axial skeleton. The lower limb includes the bones of the thigh, the leg, and the foot.<br/>The structural classification of joints divides them into fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints. The bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue. Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. Synovial joints are joints that have a space between the adjoining bones. The movement of synovial joints includes angular and rotational. Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis.<br/>The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Muscles are composed of individual cells called muscle fibers. Muscle fibers consist of myofilaments composed of the proteins actin and myosin arranged in units called sarcomeres. Contraction of the muscle occurs by the combined action of myosin and actin fibers sliding past each other when the myosin heads bind to the actin fiber, bend, disengage, and then repeat the process.</p><p class="s20">446                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 16 | The Body’s Systems</p><p class="s52">16.6 Nervous System</p><p>The nervous system is made up of neurons and glia. Neurons are specialized cells that are capable of sending electrical as well as chemical signals. Most neurons contain dendrites, which receive these signals, and axons that send signals to other neurons or tissues. Glia are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support neuronal development and signaling. There are several types of glia that serve different functions.<br/>Neurons have a resting potential across their membranes and when they are stimulated by a strong enough signal from another neuron an action potential may carry an electrochemical signal along the neuron to a synapse with another neuron. Neurotransmitters carry signals across synapses to initiate a response in another neuron.<br/>The vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord, which are covered and protected by three meninges. The brain contains structurally and functionally defined regions. In mammals, these include the cortex (which can be broken down into four primary functional lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal), basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system, cerebellum, and brainstem—although structures in some of these designations overlap. While functions may be primarily localized to one structure in the brain, most complex functions, like language and sleep,<br/>involve neurons in multiple brain regions. The spinal cord is the information superhighway that connects the brain with the rest of the body through its connections with peripheral nerves. It transmits sensory and motor input and also controls motor reflexes.<br/>The peripheral nervous system contains both the autonomic and sensory-somatic nervous systems. The autonomic nervous system provides unconscious control over visceral functions and has two divisions: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations to prepare the animal for a “fight-or- flight” response. The parasympathetic nervous system is active during restful periods. The sensory-somatic nervous<br/>system is made of cranial and spinal nerves that transmit sensory information from skin and muscle to the CNS and motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 16.2 </span><span class="p">When bacteria are destroyed by leukocytes, pyrogens are released into the blood.

The vertebrate defense systems, including those of humans, are complex and multilayered, with defenses unique to vertebrates. These unique vertebrate defenses interact with other defense systems inherited from ancestral lineages, and include complex and specific pathogen recognition and memory mechanisms. Research continues to unravel the complexities and vulnerabilities of the immune system.<br/>Despite a poor understanding of the workings of the body in the early 18th century in Europe, the practice of inoculation as a method to prevent the often-deadly effects of smallpox was introduced from the courts of the Ottoman Empire. The method involved causing limited infection with the smallpox virus by introducing the pus of an affected individual to a scratch in an uninfected person. The resulting infection was milder than if it had been caught naturally and mortality rates were shown to be about two percent rather than 30 percent from natural infections. Moreover, the inoculation gave the individual immunity to the disease. It was from these early experiences with inoculation that the methods of vaccination were developed, in which a weakened or relatively harmless (killed) derivative of a pathogen is introduced into the individual. The vaccination induces immunity to the disease with few of the risks of being infected. A modern understanding of the causes of the infectious disease and the mechanisms of the immune system began in the late 19th century and continues to grow today.</p><p class="s20">450                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_646.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">17.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Viruses</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe how viruses were first discovered and how they are detected<br/>•   Explain the detailed steps of viral replication<br/>•   Describe how vaccines are used in prevention and treatment of viral diseases<br/><span><IMG width="481" height="159" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_647.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  17.2  <span class="s30">(a)  The  tobacco mosaic virus,  seen by  transmission  electron microscopy, was  the  first  virus  to  be discovered.

Modern viruses are thought to be a mosaic of bits and pieces of nucleic acids picked up from various sources along their respective evolutionary paths. Viruses are <b>acellular</b>, parasitic entities that are not classified within any domain because they are not considered alive. They have no plasma membrane, internal organelles, or metabolic processes, and they do not divide. Instead, they infect a host cell and use the host’s replication processes to produce progeny virus particles. Viruses infect all forms of organisms including bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals. Living things grow, metabolize, and reproduce. Viruses replicate, but to do so, they are entirely dependent on their host cells. They do not metabolize or grow, but are assembled in their mature form.<br/>Viruses are diverse. They vary in their structure, their replication methods, and in their target hosts or even host cells. While most biological diversity can be understood through evolutionary history, such as how species have adapted to conditions and environments, much about virus origins and evolution remains unknown.</p><p class="s24">How Viruses Replicate</p><p>Viruses were first discovered after the development of a porcelain filter, called the Chamberland-Pasteur filter, which could remove all bacteria visible under the microscope from any liquid sample. In 1886, Adolph Meyer demonstrated that a disease of tobacco plants, tobacco mosaic disease, could be transferred from a diseased plant to a healthy one through liquid plant extracts. In 1892, Dmitri Ivanowski showed that this disease could be transmitted in this way even after the Chamberland-Pasteur filter had removed all viable bacteria from the extract. Still, it was many years before it was proven that these “filterable” infectious agents were not simply very small bacteria but were a new type of tiny, disease-causing particle.<br/>Virions, single virus particles, are very small, about 20–250 nanometers (1 nanometer = 1/1,000,000 mm). These individual virus particles are the infectious form of a virus outside the host cell. Unlike bacteria (which are about 100 times larger), we cannot see viruses with a light microscope, with the exception of some large virions of the poxvirus family (<span class="s32">Figure 17.3</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease                                                                                                                                                             451</p><p><span><IMG width="503" height="297" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_648.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 17.3 <span class="s30">The size of a virus is very small relative to the size of cells and organelles.</span></p><p>It was not until the development of the electron microscope in the 1940s that scientists got their first good view of the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus (<span class="s32">Figure 17.2</span>) and others.

They were initially grouped by shared morphology, meaning their size, shape, and distinguishing structures. Later, groups of viruses were classified by the type of nucleic acid they contained, DNA or RNA, and whether their nucleic acid was single- or double-stranded. More recently, molecular analysis of viral replication cycles has further refined their classification.<br/>A <b>virion </b>consists of a nucleic-acid core, an outer protein coating, and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell. The most visible difference between members of viral families is their morphology, which is quite diverse. An interesting feature of viral complexity is that the complexity of the host does not correlate to the complexity of the virion. Some of the most complex virion structures are observed in bacteriophages, viruses that infect the simplest living organisms, bacteria.<br/>Viruses come in many shapes and sizes, but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family (<span class="s32">Figure 17.5</span>). All virions have a nucleic-acid genome covered by a protective layer of protein, called a <b>capsid</b>. The capsid is made of protein subunits called capsomeres. Some viral capsids are simple polyhedral “spheres,” whereas others are quite complex in structure. The outer structure surrounding the capsid of some viruses is called the <b>viral envelope</b>. All viruses use some sort of <b>glycoprotein </b>to attach to their host cells at molecules on the cell called viral receptors. The virus exploits these cell-surface</p><p class="s20">452                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease</p><p>molecules, which the cell uses for some other purpose, as a way to recognize and infect specific cell types. For example, the measles virus uses a cell-surface glycoprotein in humans that normally functions in immune reactions and possibly in the sperm-egg interaction at fertilization. Attachment is a requirement for viruses to later penetrate the cell membrane, inject the viral genome, and complete their replication inside the cell.<br/>The T4 bacteriophage, which infects the <i>E. coli </i>bacterium, is among the most complex virion known; T4 has a protein tail structure that the virus uses to attach to the host cell and a head structure that houses its DNA.<br/>Adenovirus, a nonenveloped animal virus that causes respiratory illnesses in humans, uses protein spikes protruding from its capsomeres to attach to the host cell. Nonenveloped viruses also include those that cause polio (poliovirus), plantar warts (papillomavirus), and hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus). Nonenveloped viruses tend to be more robust and more likely to survive under harsh conditions, such as the gut.<br/>Enveloped virions like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the causative agent in AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), consist of nucleic acid (RNA in the case of HIV) and capsid proteins surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope and its associated proteins (<span class="s32">Figure 17.5</span>). Chicken pox, influenza, and mumps are examples of diseases caused by viruses with envelopes. Because of the fragility of the envelope, nonenveloped viruses are more resistant to changes in temperature, pH, and some disinfectants than enveloped viruses.<br/>Overall, the shape of the virion and the presence or absence of an envelope tells us little about what diseases the viruses may cause or what species they might infect, but is still a useful means to begin viral classification.</p><p class="s29">Figure  17.5  <span class="s30">Viruses  can  be  complex  in shape or relatively  simple.

It may also be linear or circular. While most viruses contain a single segment of nucleic acid, others have genomes that consist of several segments.<br/>DNA viruses have a DNA core. The viral DNA directs the host cell’s replication proteins to synthesize new copies of the viral genome and to transcribe and translate that genome into viral proteins. DNA viruses cause human diseases such as chickenpox, hepatitis B, and some venereal diseases like herpes and genital warts.<br/>RNA viruses contain only RNA in their cores. To replicate their genomes in the host cell, the genomes of RNA viruses encode enzymes not found in host cells. RNA polymerase enzymes are not as stable as DNA polymerases and often make mistakes during transcription. For this reason, mutations, changes in the nucleotide sequence, in RNA viruses occur more frequently than in DNA viruses. This leads to more rapid evolution and change in RNA viruses. For example, the fact that influenza is an RNA virus is one reason a new flu vaccine is needed every year. Human diseases caused by RNA viruses include hepatitis C, measles, and rabies.<br/>Viruses can be seen as obligate intracellular parasites. The virus must attach to a living cell, be taken inside, manufacture its proteins and copy its genome, and find a way to escape the cell so the virus can infect other cells and ultimately other individuals. Viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host. The molecular basis for this specificity is that a particular surface molecule, known as the viral receptor, must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach. Also, metabolic differences seen in different cell types based on differential gene expression are a likely factor in which cells a virus may use to replicate. The cell must be making the substances the virus needs, such as enzymes the virus genome itself does not have genes for, or the virus will not be able to replicate using that cell.</p><p class="s34">Steps of Virus Infections</p><p>A virus must “take over” a cell to replicate. The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, called <b>cytopathic </b>effects, can change cell functions or even destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus (rhinovirus), die through lysis (bursting) or <b>apoptosis </b>(programmed cell death or “cell suicide”), releasing all the progeny virions at once. The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus, which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body, and from cell damage caused by the virus. Many animal viruses, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that HIV infects may make it impossible for the cells to function as mediators of immunity, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_651.jpg"/></span><br/>A virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host-cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or proteins embedded in its envelope. The attachment is specific, and typically a virus will only attach to cells of one or a few species and only certain cell types within those species with the appropriate receptors.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_652.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/influenza2" class="s25">View this </a>video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/influenza2) <span class="p">for a visual explanation of how influenza attacks the body. Unlike animal viruses, the nucleic acid of bacteriophages is injected into the host cell naked, leaving the capsid outside the</span></p><p>cell. Plant and animal viruses can enter their cells through endocytosis, in which the cell membrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus. Some enveloped viruses enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly with the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid is degraded and the viral nucleic acid is released, which then becomes available for replication and transcription.<br/>The replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use host cell proteins and enzymes to make additional DNA that is used to copy the genome or be transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then used in protein synthesis. RNA viruses, such as the influenza virus, usually use the RNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The viral mRNA is translated into viral enzymes and capsid proteins to assemble new virions (<span class="s32">Figure 17.6</span>). Of course, there are exceptions to this pattern. If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral genes supply the information to direct synthesis of the missing proteins. Retroviruses, such as HIV, have</p><p class="s20">454                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease</p><p>an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed to make DNA, which then is inserted into the host’s DNA. To convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse transcriptase that transcribes an RNA template to DNA. The fact that HIV produces some of its own enzymes, which are not found in the host, has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes. These drugs, including the reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT, inhibit HIV replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the host’s metabolism.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="467" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_653.png"/></span><br/>The last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions into the host organism, where they are able to infect adjacent cells and repeat the replication cycle. Some viruses are released when the host cell dies and other viruses can leave infected cells by budding through the membrane without directly killing the cell.</p><p class="s29">Figure  17.6  <span class="s30">In influenza  virus  infection,  glycoproteins attach to a  host  epithelial  cell.

A <b>vaccine </b>may be prepared using weakened live viruses, killed viruses, or molecular subunits of the virus. In general, live viruses lead to better immunity, but have the possibility of causing disease at some low frequency. Killed viral vaccine and the subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease, but in general lead to less effective or long-lasting immunity.<br/>Weakened live viral vaccines are designed in the laboratory to cause few symptoms in recipients while giving them immunity against future infections. Polio was one disease that represented a milestone in the use of vaccines. Mass immunization campaigns in the U.S. in the 1950s (killed vaccine) and 1960s (live vaccine) essentially eradicated the disease, which caused muscle paralysis in children and generated fear in the general population when regional epidemics occurred. The success of the polio vaccine paved the way for the routine dispensation of childhood vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and other diseases.<br/>Live vaccines are usually made by <b>attenuation </b>(weakening) of the “wild-type” (disease-causing) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host. For example, the virus may be grown in cells in a test tube, in bird embryos, or in live animals. The adaptation to these new cells or temperature induces mutations in the virus’ genomes, allowing them to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting their ability to cause disease when reintroduced into the conditions found in the host. These attenuated viruses thus still cause an infection, but they do not grow very well, allowing the immune response to develop in time to prevent major disease. The danger of using live vaccines, which are usually more effective than killed vaccines, is the low but significant risk that these viruses will revert back to their disease-causing form by back mutations. Back mutations occur when the vaccine undergoes mutations in the host such that it readapts to the host and can again cause disease, which can then be spread to other humans in an epidemic. This happened as recently as 2007 in Nigeria where mutations in a polio vaccine led to an epidemic of polio in that country.<br/>Some vaccines are in continuous development because certain viruses, such as influenza and HIV, have a high mutation rate compared to other viruses or host cells. With influenza, mutation in genes for the surface molecules helps the virus evade the protective immunity that may have been obtained in a previous influenza season, making it necessary for individuals to get vaccinated every year. Other viruses, such as those that cause the childhood diseases measles, mumps, and rubella, mutate so little that the same vaccine is used year after year.</p><p class="s20">456                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease</p><p class="s34">Vaccines and Antiviral Drugs for Treatment</p><p>In some cases, vaccines can be used to treat an active viral infection. In the case of rabies, a fatal neurological disease transmitted in the saliva of rabies virus-infected animals, the progression of the disease from the time of the animal bite to the time it enters the central nervous system may be two weeks or longer. This is enough time to vaccinate an individual who suspects being bitten by a rabid animal, and the boosted immune response from the vaccination is enough to prevent the virus from entering nervous tissue. Thus, the fatal neurological consequences of the disease are averted and the individual only has to recover from the infected bite. This approach is also being used for the treatment of Ebola, one of the fastest and most deadly viruses affecting humans, though usually infecting limited populations. Ebola is also a leading cause of death in gorillas. Transmitted by bats and great apes, this virus can cause death in 70–90 percent of the infected within two weeks. Using newly developed vaccines that boost the immune response, there is hope that immune systems of affected individuals will be better able to control the virus, potentially reducing mortality rates.<br/>Another way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs. These drugs often have limited ability to cure viral disease but have been used to control and reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases. For most viruses, these drugs inhibit the virus by blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins. It is important that the targeted proteins be encoded for by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell. In this way, viral growth is inhibited without damaging the host. There are large numbers of antiviral drugs available to treat infections, some specific for a particular virus and others that can affect multiple viruses.<br/>Antivirals have been developed to treat genital herpes (herpes simplex II) and influenza. For genital herpes, drugs such as acyclovir can reduce the number and duration of the episodes of active viral disease during which patients develop viral lesions in their skins cells. As the virus remains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life, this drug is not a cure but can make the symptoms of the disease more manageable. For influenza, drugs like Tamiflu can reduce the duration of “flu” symptoms by one or two days, but the drug does not prevent symptoms entirely. Other antiviral drugs, such as Ribavirin, have been used to treat a variety of viral infections.<br/>By far the most successful use of antivirals has been in the treatment of the retrovirus HIV, which causes a disease that, if untreated, is usually fatal within 10–12 years after being infected. Anti-HIV drugs have been able to control viral replication to the point that individuals receiving these drugs survive for a significantly longer time than the untreated.<br/>Anti-HIV drugs inhibit viral replication at many different phases of the HIV replicative cycle. Drugs have been developed that inhibit the fusion of the HIV viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell (fusion inhibitors), the conversion of its RNA genome to double-stranded DNA (reverse transcriptase inhibitors), the integration of the viral DNA into the host genome (integrase inhibitors), and the processing of viral proteins (protease inhibitors).<br/>When any of these drugs are used individually, the virus’ high mutation rate allows the virus to rapidly evolve resistance to the drug. The breakthrough in the treatment of HIV was the development of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which involves a mixture of different drugs, sometimes called a drug “cocktail.” By attacking the virus at different stages of its replication cycle, it is difficult for the virus to develop resistance to multiple drugs at the same time. Still, even with the use of combination HAART therapy, there is concern that, over time, the virus will evolve resistance to this therapy. Thus, new anti-HIV drugs are constantly being developed with the hope of continuing the battle against this highly fatal virus.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_657.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">17.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Innate Immunity</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the body’s innate physical and chemical defenses<br/>•   Explain the inflammatory response<br/>•   Describe the complement system<br/>The vertebrate, including human, immune system is a complex multilayered system for defending against external and internal threats to the integrity of the body. The system can be divided into two types of defense systems: the innate immune system, which is nonspecific toward a particular kind of pathogen, and the adaptive immune system, which is specific (<span class="s32">Figure 17.8</span>). <b>Innate immunity </b>is not caused by an infection or vaccination and depends initially on physical and chemical barriers that work on all pathogens, sometimes called the first line of defense. The second line of defense of the innate system includes chemical signals that produce inflammation and fever responses as well as mobilizing protective cells and other chemical defenses. The adaptive immune system mounts a highly specific response to substances and organisms that do not belong in the body. The adaptive system takes longer to respond and has a memory system that allows it to respond with greater intensity should the body reencounter a pathogen even years later.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease                                                                                                                                                             457</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="178" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_658.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 17.8 <span class="s30">There  are two main parts  to the vertebrate immune  system. The innate  immune  system, which is made up of physical  barriers and internal defenses, responds to all pathogens. The adaptive immune  system is highly specific.</span></p><p class="s24">External and Chemical Barriers</p><p>The body has significant physical barriers to potential pathogens. The skin contains the protein keratin, which resists physical entry into cells. Other body surfaces, particularly those associated with body openings, are protected by the mucous membranes. The sticky mucus provides a physical trap for pathogens, preventing their movement deeper into the body. The openings of the body, such as the nose and ears, are protected by hairs that catch pathogens, and the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract have cilia that constantly move pathogens trapped in the mucus coat up to the mouth.<br/>The skin and mucous membranes also create a chemical environment that is hostile to many microorganisms. The surface of the skin is acidic, which prevents bacterial growth. Saliva, mucus, and the tears of the eye contain an enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls. The stomach secretions create a highly acidic environment, which kills many pathogens entering the digestive system.<br/>Finally, the surface of the body and the lower digestive system have a community of microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea, and fungi that coexist without harming the body. There is evidence that these organisms are highly beneficial to their host, combating disease-causing organisms and outcompeting them for nutritional resources provided by the host body. Despite these defenses, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the protections of mucus or cilia.</p><p class="s24">Internal Defenses</p><p>When pathogens enter the body, the innate immune system responds with a variety of internal defenses. These include the inflammatory response, phagocytosis, natural killer cells, and the complement system. White blood cells in the blood and lymph recognize pathogens as foreign to the body. A <b>white blood cell </b>is larger than a red blood cell, is nucleated, and is typically able to move using amoeboid locomotion. Because they can move on their own, white blood cells can leave the blood to go to infected tissues. For example, a <b>monocyte </b>is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and develops into a macrophage after it moves into infected tissue. A <b>macrophage </b>is a large cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens. <b>Mast cells </b>are produced in the same way as white blood cells, but unlike circulating white blood cells, mast cells take up residence in connective tissues and especially mucosal tissues. They are responsible for releasing chemicals in response to physical injury. They also play a role in the allergic response, which will be discussed later in the chapter.<br/>When a pathogen is recognized as foreign, chemicals called cytokines are released. A <b>cytokine </b>is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and function), proliferation (production), and gene expression to produce a variety of immune responses. Approximately 40 types of cytokines exist in humans. In addition to being released from white blood cells after pathogen recognition, cytokines are also released by the infected cells and bind to nearby uninfected cells, inducing those cells to release cytokines. This positive feedback loop results in a burst of cytokine production.<br/>One class of early-acting cytokines is the interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells. An <b>interferon </b>is a small protein that signals a viral infection to other cells. The interferons stimulate uninfected cells to produce compounds that interfere with viral replication. Interferons also activate macrophages and other cells.</p><p class="s34">The Inflammatory Response and Phagocytosis</p><p>The first cytokines to be produced encourage <b>inflammation</b>, a localized redness, swelling, heat, and pain. Inflammation is a response to physical trauma, such as a cut or a blow, chemical irritation, and infection by pathogens (viruses, bacteria, or fungi). The chemical signals that trigger an inflammatory response enter the extracellular fluid and cause capillaries to dilate (expand) and capillary walls to become more permeable, or leaky. The serum and other compounds leaking from</p><p class="s20">458                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease</p><p>capillaries cause swelling of the area, which in turn causes pain. Various kinds of white blood cells are attracted to the area of inflammation. The types of white blood cells that arrive at an inflamed site depend on the nature of the injury or infecting pathogen. For example, a <b>neutrophil </b>is an early arriving white blood cell that engulfs and digests pathogens. Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells of the immune system (<span class="s32">Figure 17.9</span>). Macrophages follow neutrophils and take over the phagocytosis function and are involved in the resolution of an inflamed site, cleaning up cell debris and pathogens.<br/><span><IMG width="221" height="196" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_659.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 17.9 <span class="s30">White blood cells (leukocytes) release chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory  response following a cut in the skin.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_660.jpg"/></span><br/>Cytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling sick, which include lethargy, muscle pain, and nausea. Cytokines also increase the core body temperature, causing a fever. The elevated temperatures of a fever inhibit the growth of pathogens and speed up cellular repair processes. For these reasons, suppression of fevers should be limited to those that are dangerously high.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_661.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neutrophil" class="s25">Check out this </a>23-second, stop-motion video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neutrophil) <span class="p">showing a neutrophil that searches and engulfs fungus spores during an elapsed time of 79 minutes.</span></p><p class="s34">Natural Killer Cells</p><p>A <b>lymphocyte </b>is a white blood cell that contains a large nucleus (<span class="s32">Figure 17.10</span>).

A <b>natural killer (NK) cell </b>is a lymphocyte that can kill cells infected with viruses (or cancerous cells). NK cells identify intracellular infections, especially from viruses, by the altered expression of <b>major histocompatibility class (MHC) I molecules </b>on the surface of infected cells. MHC class I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells that provide a sample of the cell’s internal environment at any given time.

Liver cells and macrophages synthesize inactive forms of complement proteins continuously; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms. The complement system is so named because it is complementary to the innate and adaptive immune system. Complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already tagged by the adaptive immune system. This “tagging” involves the attachment of specific proteins called antibodies (discussed in detail later) to the pathogen. When they attach, the antibodies change shape providing a binding site for one of the complement proteins. After the first few complement proteins bind, a cascade of binding in a specific sequence of proteins follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement proteins.<br/>Complement proteins perform several functions, one of which is to serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells and enhance engulfment. Certain complement proteins can combine to open pores in microbial cell membranes and cause lysis of the cells.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_664.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">17.3 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Adaptive Immunity</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Explain adaptive immunity<br/>•   Describe cell-mediated immune response and humoral immune response<br/>•   Describe immune tolerance</p><p class="s20">460                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease</p><p>The adaptive, or acquired, immune response takes days or even weeks to become established—much longer than the innate response; however, adaptive immunity is more specific to an invading pathogen. <b>Adaptive immunity </b>is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination. An <b>antigen </b>is a molecule that stimulates a response in the immune system. This part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection. In fact, without information from the innate immune system, the adaptive response could not be mobilized. There are two types of adaptive responses: the <b>cell-mediated immune response</b>, which is controlled by activated <b>T cells</b>, and the <b>humoral immune response</b>, which is controlled by activated <b>B cells </b>and antibodies. Activated T and B cells whose surface binding sites are specific to the molecules on the pathogen greatly increase in numbers and attack the invading pathogen. Their attack can kill pathogens directly or they can secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens and disrupt the infection. Adaptive immunity also involves a memory to give the host long-term protection from reinfection with the same type of pathogen; on reexposure, this host memory will facilitate a rapid and powerful response.</p><p class="s24">B and T Cells</p><p>Lymphocytes, which are white blood cells, are formed with other blood cells in the red bone marrow found in many flat bones, such as the shoulder or pelvic bones. The two types of lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response are B and T cells (<span class="s32">Figure 17.12</span>). Whether an immature lymphocyte becomes a B cell or T cell depends on where in the body it matures. The B cells remain in the bone marrow to mature (hence the name “B” for “bone marrow”), while T cells migrate to the thymus, where they mature (hence the name “T” for “thymus”).<br/>Maturation of a B or T cell involves becoming immunocompetent, meaning that it can recognize, by binding, a specific molecule or antigen (discussed below). During the maturation process, B and T cells that bind too strongly to the body’s own cells are eliminated in order to minimize an immune response against the body’s own tissues. Those cells that react weakly to the body’s own cells, but have highly specific receptors on their cell surfaces that allow them to recognize a foreign molecule, or antigen, remain. This process occurs during fetal development and continues throughout life. The specificity of this receptor is determined by the genetics of the individual and is present before a foreign molecule is introduced to the body or encountered. Thus, it is genetics and not experience that initially provides a vast array of cells, each capable of binding to a different specific foreign molecule. Once they are immunocompetent, the T and B cells will migrate to the spleen and lymph nodes where they will remain until they are called on during an infection. B cells are involved in the humoral immune response, which targets pathogens loose in blood and lymph, and T cells are involved in the cell-mediated immune response, which targets infected cells.<br/><span><IMG width="251" height="232" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_665.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  17.12  <span class="s30">This scanning electron micrograph shows a T lymphocyte.

Not every molecule is antigenic. B cells participate in a chemical response to antigens present in the body by producing specific antibodies that circulate throughout the body and bind with the antigen whenever it is encountered. This is known as the humoral immune response. As discussed, during maturation of B cells, a set of highly specific B cells are produced that have many antigen receptor molecules in their membrane (<span class="s32">Figure 17.13</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease                                                                                                                                                             461</p><p><span><IMG width="200" height="244" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_666.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  17.13  <span class="s30">B cell receptors are  embedded in the membranes of B cells and  bind a variety of antigens through  their variable  regions.</span></p><p>Each B cell has only one kind of antigen receptor, which makes every B cell different. Once the B cells mature in the bone marrow, they migrate to lymph nodes or other lymphatic organs. When a B cell encounters the antigen that binds to its receptor, the antigen molecule is brought into the cell by endocytosis and reappears on the surface of the cell bound to an <b>MHC class II molecule</b>. When this process is complete, the B cell is sensitized. In most cases, the sensitized B cell must then encounter a specific kind of T cell, called a helper T cell, before it is activated. The helper T cell must already have been activated through an encounter with the antigen (discussed below).<br/>The helper T cell binds to the antigen-MHC class II complex and is induced to release cytokines that induce the B cell to divide rapidly, which makes thousands of identical (clonal) cells. These daughter cells become either plasma cells or memory B cells. The memory B cells remain inactive at this point, until another later encounter with the antigen, caused by a reinfection by the same bacteria or virus, results in them dividing into a new population of plasma cells. The plasma cells, on the other hand, produce and secrete large quantities, up to 100 million molecules per hour, of antibody molecules. An <b>antibody</b>, also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen. Antibodies are the agents of humoral immunity. Antibodies occur in the blood, in gastric and mucus secretions, and in breast milk. Antibodies in these bodily fluids can bind pathogens and mark them for destruction by phagocytes before they can infect cells.<br/>These antibodies circulate in the blood stream and lymphatic system and bind with the antigen whenever it is encountered. The binding can fight infection in several ways. Antibodies can bind to viruses or bacteria and interfere with the chemical interactions required for them to infect or bind to other cells. The antibodies may create bridges between different particles containing antigenic sites clumping them all together and preventing their proper functioning. The antigen-antibody complex stimulates the complement system described previously, destroying the cell bearing the antigen. Phagocytic cells, such as those already described, are attracted by the antigen-antibody complexes, and phagocytosis is enhanced when the complexes are present. Finally, antibodies stimulate inflammation, and their presence in mucus and on the skin prevents pathogen attack.<br/>Antibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them by blocking key sites on the pathogen that enhance their infectivity (such as receptors that “dock” pathogens on host cells) (<span class="s32">Figure 17.14</span>). Antibody neutralization can prevent pathogens from entering and infecting host cells. The neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be filtered by the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces.<br/>Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils, in a process called opsonization. In a process called complement fixation, some antibodies provide a place for complement proteins to bind. The combination of antibodies and complement promotes rapid clearing of pathogens.<br/>The production of antibodies by plasma cells in response to an antigen is called <b>active immunity </b>and describes the host’s active response of the immune system to an infection or to a vaccination. There is also a <b>passive immune </b>response where antibodies come from an outside source, instead of the individual’s own plasma cells, and are introduced into the host. For example, antibodies circulating in a pregnant woman’s body move across the placenta into the developing fetus. The child benefits from the presence of these antibodies for up to several months after birth. In addition, a passive immune response is possible by injecting antibodies into an individual in the form of an antivenom to a snake-bite toxin or antibodies in blood</p><p class="s20">462                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease</p><p>serum to help fight a hepatitis infection.

Instead,  dendritic  cells  and macrophages first engulf and digest pathogens into hundreds or thousands of antigens. Then, an <b>antigen-presenting cell (APC) </b>detects, engulfs, and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection. When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will engulf and break it down through phagocytosis. Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells. A <b>dendritic cell </b>is an immune cell that mops up antigenic materials in its surroundings and presents them on its surface. Dendritic cells are located in the skin, the linings of the nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. These positions are ideal locations to encounter invading pathogens. Once they are activated by pathogens and mature to become APCs they migrate to the spleen or a lymph node. Macrophages also function as APCs. After phagocytosis by a macrophage, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome. Within the resulting phagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation (<span class="s32">Figure 17.15</span>). Helper T cells cannot properly respond to an antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC class II molecule. The APCs express MHC class II on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal an invader.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease                                                                                                                                                             463</p><p><span><IMG width="305" height="246" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_668.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_669.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  17.15  <span class="s30">An antigen-presenting cell (APC), such  as a macrophage, engulfs  a foreign antigen, partially digests it in a lysosome, and  then  embeds it in an  MHC class II molecule for presentation at the  cell surface.

Some respond to APCs of the innate immune system and indirectly induce immune responses by releasing cytokines. Others stimulate B cells to start the humoral response as described previously. Another type of T cell detects APC signals and directly kills the infected cells, while some are involved in suppressing inappropriate immune reactions to harmless or “self” antigens.<br/>There are two main types of T cells: helper T lymphocytes (T<span class="s54">H</span>) and the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (T<span class="s54">C</span>). The T<span class="s54">H </span>lymphocytes function indirectly to tell other immune cells about potential pathogens. T<span class="s54">H  </span>lymphocytes recognize specific antigens presented by the MHC class II complexes of APCs. There are two populations of T<span class="s54">H </span>cells: T<span class="s54">H</span>1 and T<span class="s54">H</span>2. T<span class="s54">H</span>1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells. T<span class="s54">H</span>2 cells stimulate naïve B cells to secrete antibodies. Whether a T<span class="s54">H</span>1 or a T<span class="s54">H</span>2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate immune system, which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen.<br/>Cytotoxic T cells (T<span class="s54">C</span>) are the key component of the cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system and attack and destroy infected cells. T<span class="s54">C  </span>cells are particularly important in protecting against viral infections; this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating antibodies. Once activated, the T<span class="s54">C </span>creates a large clone of cells with one specific set of cell-surface receptors, as in the case with proliferation of activated B cells. As with B cells, the clone includes active T<span class="s54">C </span>cells and inactive memory T<span class="s54">C </span>cells. The resulting active T<span class="s54">C </span>cells then identify infected host cells. Because of the time required to generate a population of clonal T and B cells, there is a delay in the adaptive immune response compared to the innate immune response.<br/>T<span class="s54">C </span>cells attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen can replicate and escape, thereby halting the progression of intracellular infections. T<span class="s54">C </span>cells also support NK lymphocytes to destroy early cancers.

During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been encountered before, known as the <b>primary immune response</b>, plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells increase, then plateau over time. As B and T cells mature into effector cells, a subset of the naïve populations differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen specificities (<span class="s32">Figure 17.17</span>). A <b>memory cell </b>is an antigen-specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into an effector cell during the primary immune response, but that can immediately become an effector cell on reexposure to the same pathogen. As the infection is cleared and pathogenic stimuli subside, the effectors are no longer needed and they undergo apoptosis. In contrast, the memory cells persist in the circulation.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease                                                                                                                                                             465</p><p class="s29">Figure  17.17  <span class="s30">After initially binding an antigen to the B cell receptor, a B cell internalizes the antigen and presents it on MHC class II.

However, if the host is re- exposed to the same pathogen type, circulating memory cells will immediately differentiate into plasma cells and T<span class="s54">C </span>cells without input from APCs or T<span class="s54">H </span>cells. This is known as the <b>secondary immune response</b>. One reason why the adaptive immune response is delayed is because it takes time for naïve B and T cells with the appropriate antigen specificities to be identified, activated, and proliferate. On reinfection, this step is skipped, and the result is a more rapid production of immune defenses. Memory B cells that differentiate into plasma cells output tens to hundreds-fold greater antibody amounts than were secreted during the primary response (<span class="s32">Figure 17.18</span>). This rapid and dramatic antibody response may stop the infection before it can even become established, and the individual may not realize they had been exposed.</p><p class="s20">466                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease</p><p><span><IMG width="278" height="206" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_673.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  17.18  <span class="s30">In the primary response to infection,  antibodies are  secreted first from plasma cells.

The immune response to vaccination may not be perceived by the host as illness but still confers immune memory. When exposed to the corresponding pathogen to which an individual was vaccinated, the reaction is similar to a secondary exposure. Because each reinfection generates more memory cells and increased resistance to the pathogen, some vaccine courses involve one or more booster vaccinations to mimic repeat exposures.</p><p class="s24">The Lymphatic  System</p><p class="s27">Lymph <span class="p">is the watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs and contains protective white blood cells but does not contain erythrocytes. Lymph moves about the body through the lymphatic system, which is made up of vessels, lymph ducts, lymph glands, and organs, such as tonsils, adenoids, thymus, and spleen.</span></p><p>Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors through the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which include monocytes (the precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes. Most cells in the blood are red blood cells. Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue).<br/>Recall that cells of the immune system originate from stem cells in the bone marrow. B cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, whereas progenitor cells migrate from the bone marrow and develop and mature into naïve T cells in the organ called the thymus.<br/>On maturation, T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations. Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (<span class="s32">Figure 17.19</span>). Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues. These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation. APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease                                                                                                                                                             467</p><p><span><IMG width="428" height="208" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_674.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 17.19  <span class="s30">(a) Lymphatic vessels carry a clear fluid called lymph throughout the body.

The mucosal tissue includes the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus, and the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts.<br/>Mucosal immunity is formed by MALT, which functions independently of the systemic immune system, and which has its own innate and adaptive components. MALT is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body. This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment. The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell types. Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells and delivered to APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue.

Activated T cells then migrate through the lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of infection.</p><p class="s24">Immune Tolerance</p><p>The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful, unnecessary responses to harmless substances, and more importantly, so that it does not attack “self.” The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease, or self-antigens, is described as <b>immune tolerance</b>. The primary mechanism for developing immune tolerance to self-antigens occurs during the selection for weakly self-binding cells during T and B lymphocyte maturation. There are populations of T cells that suppress the immune response to self- antigens and that suppress the immune response after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis. Immune tolerance is especially well developed in the mucosa of the upper digestive system because of the tremendous number of foreign substances (such as food proteins) that APCs of the oral cavity, pharynx, and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter. Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver, lymph nodes, small intestine, and lung that present harmless antigens to a diverse population of regulatory T (T<span class="s54">reg</span>) cells, specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors. The combined result of T<span class="s54">reg  </span>cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="90" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_676.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">17.4 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Disruptions in the Immune System</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe hypersensitivity<br/>•   Define autoimmunity<br/>A functioning immune system is essential for survival, but even the sophisticated cellular and molecular defenses of the mammalian immune response can be defeated by pathogens at virtually every step. In the competition between immune protection and pathogen evasion, pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution because of their shorter generation time, large population sizes and often higher mutation rates. Thus pathogens have evolved a diverse array of immune escape mechanisms. For instance, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae </i>(the bacterium that causes pneumonia and meningitis) surrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune system. <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(the bacterium that can cause skin infections, abscesses, and meningitis) synthesizes a toxin called leukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium. Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system. HIV infects T<span class="s54">H </span>cells using their CD4 surface molecules, gradually depleting the number of T<span class="s54">H </span>cells in the body (<span class="s32">Figure 17.21</span>); this inhibits the adaptive immune system’s capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors. As a result, HIV-infected individuals often suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but which can cause devastating illness to immune-compromised individuals.<br/><span><IMG width="250" height="166" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_677.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  17.21  <span class="s30">HIV (green) is shown  budding  from a lymphocyte cell (red) in culture.

Immunodeficiency can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels so that the immune system becomes overwhelmed. Immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens that attack the cells of the immune system itself (such as HIV), chemical exposure (including certain medical treatments such as chemotherapy), malnutrition, or extreme stress. For instance, radiation exposure can destroy populations of lymphocytes and elevate an individual’s susceptibility to infections and cancer. Rarely, primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may also occur. For example, severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) is a condition in which children are born without functioning B or T cells.</span></p><p class="s24">Hypersensitivities</p><p>A maladaptive immune response toward harmless foreign substances or self-antigens that occur after tissue sensitization is termed a <b>hypersensitivity</b>. Types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmune. A large proportion of the human population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity.</p><p class="s34">Allergies</p><p>The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a usually harmless antigen is called an <b>allergy</b>. In the United States, 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. On initial exposure to a potential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies through the typical process of APCs presenting processed antigen to T<span class="s54">H </span>cells that stimulate B cells to produce the antibodies. The antibody molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues. This process primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. On subsequent exposure to the same allergen, antibody molecules on mast cells bind the antigen and stimulate the mast cell to release histamine and other inflammatory chemicals; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), which also appear to be adapted to responding to parasitic worms (<span class="s32">Figure 17.22</span>). Eosinophils release factors that enhance the inflammatory response and the secretions of mast cells. The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy, watery eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy welts or hives, airway constriction with severe respiratory distress, and plummeting blood pressure caused by dilating blood vessels and fluid loss from the circulatory system. This extreme reaction, typically in response to an allergen introduced to the circulatory system, is known as anaphylactic shock. Antihistamines are an insufficient counter to anaphylactic shock and if not treated with epinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects, this condition can be fatal.</p><p class="s20">470                                                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 17 | The Immune  System and Disease</p><p><span><IMG width="250" height="438" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_678.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  17.22  <span class="s30">On first exposure to an allergen, an antibody  is synthesized by plasma cells in response to a harmless antigen.

Delayed hypersensitivity occurs in some individuals in response to contact with certain types of jewelry or cosmetics.

Disease</p><p class="s24">CHAPTER SUMMARY</p><p class="s52">17.1 Viruses</p><p>Viruses are acellular entities that can usually only be seen with an electron microscope. Their genomes contain either DNA or RNA, and they replicate using the replication proteins of a host cell. Viruses are diverse, infecting archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Viruses consist of a nucleic-acid core surrounded by a protein capsid with or without an outer lipid envelope.<br/>Viral replication within a living cell always produces changes in the cell, sometimes resulting in cell death and sometimes slowly killing the infected cells. There are six basic stages in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release. A viral infection may be productive, resulting in new virions, or nonproductive, meaning the virus remains inside the cell without producing new virions.<br/>Viruses cause a variety of diseases in humans. Many of these diseases can be prevented by the use of viral vaccines, which stimulate protective immunity against the virus without causing major disease. Viral vaccines may also be used in active viral infections, boosting the ability of the immune system to control or destroy the virus. Antiviral drugs that target enzymes and other protein products of viral genes have been developed and used with mixed success. Combinations of<br/>anti-HIV drugs have been used to effectively control the virus, extending the lifespan of infected individuals.</p><p class="s52">17.2 Innate Immunity</p><p>The innate immune system consists first of physical and chemical barriers to infection including the skin and mucous membranes and their secretions, ciliated surfaces, and body hairs. The second line of defense is an internal defense system designed to counter pathogenic threats that bypass the physical and chemical barriers of the body. Using a combination of cellular and molecular responses, the innate immune system identifies the nature of a pathogen and responds with inflammation, phagocytosis, cytokine release, destruction by NK cells, or the complement system.</p><p class="s52">17.3 Adaptive Immunity</p><p>The adaptive immune response is a slower-acting, longer-lasting, and more specific response than the innate response. However, the adaptive response requires information from the innate immune system to function. APCs display antigens on MHC molecules to naïve T cells. T cells with cell-surface receptors that bind a specific antigen will bind to that APC. In response, the T cells differentiate and proliferate, becoming T<span class="s54">H </span>cells or T<span class="s54">C </span>cells. T<span class="s54">H </span>cells stimulate B cells that have engulfed and presented pathogen-derived antigens. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, whereas T<span class="s54">C </span>cells destroy infected or cancerous cells. Memory cells are produced by activated and proliferating B and T cells and persist after a primary exposure to a pathogen. If re-exposure occurs, memory cells differentiate into effector cells without<br/>input from the innate immune system. The mucosal immune system is largely independent of the systemic immune system but functions in parallel to protect the extensive mucosal surfaces of the body. Immune tolerance is brought about by T<span class="s54">reg </span>cells to limit reactions to harmless antigens and the body’s own molecules.</p><p class="s52">17.4 Disruptions in the Immune System</p><p>Immune disruptions may involve insufficient immune responses or inappropriate immune responses. Immunodeficiency increases an individual&#39;s susceptibility to infections and cancers. Hypersensitivities are misdirected responses either to harmless foreign particles, as in the case of allergies, or to the individual’s own tissues, as in the case of autoimmunity. Reactions to self-components may be the result of molecular mimicry.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 17.5 </span><span class="p">Which of the following statements about virus structure is true?</span></p><p>a.

Asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring (clones), whereas in sexual reproduction, the genetic material of two individuals combines to produce offspring that are genetically different from their parents. During sexual reproduction the male gamete (sperm) may be placed inside the female’s body for internal fertilization, the sperm may be left in the environment for the female to pick up and place in her body, or both sperm and eggs may be released into the environment for external fertilization. Seahorses provide an example of the latter, but with a twist (<span class="s32">Figure 18.1</span>). Following a mating dance, the female releases eggs into the male seahorse’s abdominal brood pouch and the male releases sperm into the water, which then find their way into the brood pouch to fertilize the eggs. The fertilized eggs develop in the pouch for several weeks.</p><p class="s20">478                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 18 | Animal Reproduction and Development</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="134" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_684.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">18.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>How Animals Reproduce</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe advantages and disadvantages of asexual and sexual reproduction<br/>•   Discuss asexual reproduction methods<br/>•   Discuss sexual reproduction methods<br/>•   Discuss internal and external methods of fertilization<br/>Some animals produce offspring through asexual reproduction while other animals produce offspring through sexual reproduction.  Both  methods  have  advantages  and  disadvantages.  <b>Asexual  reproduction  </b>produces  offspring  that  are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent. A single individual can produce offspring asexually and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly; these are two advantages that asexually reproducing organisms have over sexually reproducing organisms. In a stable or predictable environment, asexual reproduction is an effective means of reproduction because all the offspring will be adapted to that environment. In an unstable or unpredictable environment, species that reproduce asexually may be at a disadvantage because all the offspring are genetically identical and may not be adapted to different conditions.<br/>During <b>sexual reproduction</b>, the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring that differ from their parents. The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give sexually reproducing individuals greater fitness because more of their offspring may survive and reproduce in an unpredictable or changing environment. Species that reproduce sexually (and have separate sexes) must maintain two different types of individuals, males and females. Only half the population (females) can produce the offspring, so fewer offspring will be produced when compared to asexual reproduction. This is a disadvantage of sexual reproduction compared to asexual reproduction.</p><p class="s24">Asexual Reproduction</p><p>Asexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) and in many eukaryotic, single-celled and multi-celled organisms. There are several ways that animals reproduce asexually, the details of which vary among individual species.</p><p class="s34">Fission</p><p><b>Fission</b>, also called binary fission, occurs in some invertebrate, multi-celled organisms. It is in some ways analogous to the process of binary fission of single-celled prokaryotic organisms. The term fission is applied to instances in which an organism appears to split itself into two parts and, if necessary, regenerate the missing parts of each new organism. For example, species of turbellarian flatworms commonly called the planarians, such as <i>Dugesia dorotocephala</i>, are able to separate their bodies into head and tail regions and then regenerate the missing half in each of the two new organisms. Sea anemones (Cnidaria), such as species of the genus <i>Anthopleura </i>(<span class="s32">Figure 18.2</span>), will divide along the oral-aboral axis, and sea cucumbers (Echinodermata) of the genus <i>Holothuria, </i>will divide into two halves across the oral-aboral axis and regenerate the other half in each of the resulting individuals.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 18 | Animal Reproduction and Development                                                                                                                                                       479</p><p><span><IMG width="278" height="236" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_685.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure 18.2 </span>The <i>Anthopleura artemisia  </i>sea anemone can reproduce through  fission.</p><p class="s34">Budding</p><p><b>Budding </b>is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of the body leading to a separation of the “bud” from the original organism and the formation of two individuals, one smaller than the other.

This sea star (<span class="s32">Figure 18.4</span>) is in the process of growing a complete sea star from an arm that has been cut off. Fisheries workers have been known to try to kill the sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing them back into the ocean. Unfortunately for the workers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams.<br/><span><IMG width="421" height="180" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_689.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  18.4  </span>(a)  <i>Linckia  multifora  </i>is a  species of sea star  that  can  reproduce asexually via fragmentation.

The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid, depending on the process in the species. Parthenogenesis occurs in invertebrates such as water fleas, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, and ants, wasps, and bees. Ants, bees, and wasps use parthenogenesis to produce haploid males (drones). The diploid females (workers and queens) are the result of a fertilized egg.</span></p><p>Some  vertebrate  animals—such  as  certain  reptiles,  amphibians,  and  fish—also  reproduce  through  parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis has been observed in species in which the sexes were separated in terrestrial or marine zoos. Two female Komodo dragons, a hammerhead shark, and a blacktop shark have produced parthenogenic young when the females have been isolated from males. It is possible that the asexual reproduction observed occurred in response to unusual circumstances and would normally not occur.</p><p class="s24">Sexual Reproduction</p><p>Sexual reproduction is the combination of reproductive cells from two individuals to form genetically unique offspring. The nature of the individuals that produce the two kinds of gametes can vary, having for example separate sexes or both sexes in each individual. Sex determination, the mechanism that determines which sex an individual develops into, also can vary.</p><p class="s34">Hermaphroditism</p><p><b>Hermaphroditism </b>occurs in animals in which one individual has both male and female reproductive systems. Invertebrates such as earthworms, slugs, tapeworms, and snails (<span class="s32">Figure 18.5</span>) are often hermaphroditic. Hermaphrodites may self- fertilize, but typically they will mate with another of their species, fertilizing each other and both producing offspring. Self- fertilization is more common in animals that have limited mobility or are not motile, such as barnacles and clams. Many species have specific mechanisms in place to prevent self-fertilization, because it is an extreme form of inbreeding and usually produces less fit offspring.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 18 | Animal Reproduction and Development                                                                                                                                                       481</p><p><span><IMG width="420" height="194" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_690.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  18.5  <span class="s30">Many (a) snails  are  hermaphrodites.

Individuals homozygous for X (XX) are female and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. In mammals, the presence of a Y chromosome causes the development of male characteristics and its absence results in female characteristics. The XY system is also found in some insects and plants.<br/>Bird <b>sex determination </b>is dependent on the combination of Z and W chromosomes. Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male and heterozygous (ZW) results in a female. Notice that this system is the opposite of the mammalian system because in birds the female is the sex with the different sex chromosomes. The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar to the Y chromosome in mammals. Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use the ZW system.<br/>More complicated chromosomal sex determining systems also exist. For example, some swordtail fish have three sex chromosomes in a population.<br/>The  sex  of  some  other  species  is  not  determined  by  chromosomes,  but  by  some  aspect  of  the  environment.  Sex determination in alligators, some turtles, and tuataras, for example, is dependent on the temperature during the middle third of egg development. This is referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically, as temperature-dependent sex determination. In many turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females, while in many other species of turtles, the reverse is true. In some crocodiles and some turtles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females.<br/>Individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, switching from one to the other. If the individual is female first, it is termed protogyny or “first female,” if it is male first, it is termed protandry or “first male.” Oysters are born male, grow in size, and become female and lay eggs. The wrasses, a family of reef fishes, are all sequential hermaphrodites. Some of these species live in closely coordinated schools with a dominant male and a large number of smaller females. If the male dies, a female increases in size, changes sex, and becomes the new dominant male.</p><p class="s24">Fertilization</p><p>The fusion of a sperm and an egg is a process called fertilization. This can occur either inside ( <b>internal fertilization</b>) or outside ( <b>external fertilization</b>) the body of the female. Humans provide an example of the former, whereas frog reproduction is an example of the latter.</p><p class="s24">External Fertilization</p><p>External fertilization usually occurs in aquatic environments where both eggs and sperm are released into the water. After the sperm reaches the egg, fertilization takes place. Most external fertilization happens during the process of spawning where one or several females release their eggs and the male(s) release sperm in the same area, at the same time. The spawning may be triggered by environmental signals, such as water temperature or the length of daylight. Nearly all fish spawn, as do crustaceans (such as crabs and shrimp), mollusks (such as oysters), squid, and echinoderms (such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers). Frogs, corals, molluscs, and sea cucumbers also spawn (<span class="s32">Figure 18.6</span>).</p><p class="s20">482                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 18 | Animal Reproduction and Development</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="169" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_691.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  18.6 <span class="s30">During sexual reproduction in toads, the male  grasps the female  from behind  and  externally  fertilizes the eggs as they are deposited. (credit: Bernie Kohl)</span></p><p class="s34">Internal Fertilization</p><p>Internal fertilization occurs most often in terrestrial animals, although some aquatic animals also use this method. Internal fertilization may occur by the male directly depositing sperm in the female during mating. It may also occur by the male depositing sperm in the environment, usually in a protective structure, which a female picks up to deposit the sperm in her reproductive tract. There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization. In <b>oviparity</b>, fertilized eggs are laid outside the female’s body and develop there, receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg (<span class="s32">Figure 18.7</span><b>a</b>). This occurs in some bony fish, some reptiles, a few cartilaginous fish, some amphibians, a few mammals, and all birds. Most non-avian reptiles and insects produce leathery eggs, while birds and some turtles produce eggs with high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell, making them hard. Chicken eggs are an example of a hard shell. The eggs of the egg-laying mammals such as the platypus and echidna are leathery.<br/>In <b>ovoviparity</b>, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, and the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg’s yolk. The eggs are retained in the female’s body until they hatch inside of her, or she lays the eggs right before they hatch. This process helps protect the eggs until hatching. This occurs in some bony fish (like the platyfish <i>Xiphophorus maculatus, </i><span class="s32">Figure 18.7</span><b>b</b>), some sharks, lizards, some snakes (garter snake <i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>), some vipers, and some invertebrate animals (Madagascar hissing cockroach <i>Gromphadorhina portentosa</i>).<br/>In <b>viviparity </b>the young are born alive. They obtain their nourishment from the female and are born in varying states of maturity. This occurs in most mammals (<span class="s32">Figure 18.7</span><b>c</b>), some cartilaginous fish, and a few reptiles.<br/><span><IMG width="478" height="154" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_692.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  18.7  </span>In (a)  oviparity,  young  develop in eggs outside the  female   body,  as with these <i>Harmonia  axydridis </i>beetles hatching.

To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes, only one sperm must fuse with one egg. In mammals, a layer called the <b>zona pellucida </b>protects the egg. At the tip of the head of a sperm cell is a structure like a lysosome called the acrosome, which contains enzymes. When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a series of events, called the acrosomal reactions, take place. These reactions, involving enzymes from the acrosome, allow the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane and permit the sperm nucleus to transfer into the ovum. The nuclear membranes of the egg and sperm break down and the two haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid nucleus or genome.<br/><span><IMG width="302" height="204" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_694.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 18.8 <span class="s30">Fertilization is the process in which sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote.

Testosterone causes the primitive gonads to differentiate into male sexual organs. When testosterone is absent, the primitive gonads develop into ovaries. Tissues that produce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females. The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a female. Thus the male and female anatomies arise from a divergence in the development of what were once common embryonic structures.</p><p class="s34">Male Reproductive Anatomy</p><p>Sperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the testes are external to the body so that a correct temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals, including humans, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the body so the environment of the sperm is about 2 °C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm. If the testes do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development, the individual has reduced fertility.<br/>The <b>scrotum </b>houses the testicles or <b>testes </b>(singular: testis), and provides passage for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. The testes are a pair of male gonads that produce sperm and reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 inch) in size and divided into wedge-shaped lobes by septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm.<br/>The <b>penis </b>drains urine from the urinary bladder and is a copulatory organ during intercourse (<span class="s32">Figure 18.12</span>; <span class="s32">Table 18.1</span>). The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue that become engorged with blood, making the penis erect, in preparation for intercourse. The organ is inserted into the vagina culminating with an ejaculation. During orgasm, the accessory organs and glands connected to the testes contract and empty the semen (containing sperm) into the urethra and the fluid is expelled from the body by muscular contractions causing ejaculation. After intercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid.<br/><b>Semen </b>is a mixture of sperm (about five percent of the total) and fluids from accessory glands that contribute most of the semen’s volume. Sperm are haploid cells, consisting of a flagellum for motility, a neck that contains the cell’s energy- producing mitochondria, and a head that contains the genetic material (<span class="s32">Figure 18.11</span>). An acrosome (acrosomal vesicle) is found at the top of the head of the sperm. This structure contains enzymes that can digest the protective coverings that surround the egg and allow the sperm to fuse with the egg. An ejaculate will contain from two to five milliliters of fluid and from 50–120 million sperm per milliliter.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="224" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_700.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  18.11  <span class="s30">As seen in this scanning electron micrograph, human sperm has  a flagellum,  neck,  and  head.

Each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts that empty at the nipple and that supply the nursing child with nutrient- and antibody-rich milk to aid development and protect the child.<br/>Internal female reproductive structures include ovaries, oviducts, the uterus, and the vagina (<span class="s32">Figure 18.13</span>; <span class="s32">Table 18.2</span>). The pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments. The outermost layer of the ovary is made up of follicles, each consisting of one or more follicular cells that surround, nourish, and protect a single egg. During the menstrual period, a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares their eggs for release. At ovulation, one follicle ruptures and one egg is released. Following ovulation, the follicular tissue that surrounded the ovulated egg stays within the ovary and grows to form a solid mass called the <b>corpus luteum</b>. The corpus luteum secretes additional estrogen and the hormone progesterone that helps maintain the uterine lining during pregnancy. The ovaries also produce hormones, such as estrogen.<br/>The <b>oviducts</b>, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries, but they are not in contact with the ovaries. The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of finger- like projections called fimbrae. When an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the nonmotile egg enter into the tube. The walls of the oviducts have a ciliated epithelium over smooth muscle. The cilia beat, and the smooth muscle contracts, moving the egg toward the uterus. Fertilization usually takes place within the oviduct and the developing embryo is moved toward the uterus. It usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct.<br/>Sterilization in women is called a tubal ligation; it is analogous to a vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed, preventing sperm from reaching the egg.<br/>The <b>uterus </b>is a structure about the size of a woman’s fist. The uterus has a thick muscular wall and is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and mucus glands that develop and thicken during the female cycle. Thickening of the endometrium prepares the uterus to receive the fertilized egg or zygote, which will then implant itself in the endometrium. The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation. Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in forcing the baby through the vagina during labor. If fertilization does not occur, a portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each menstrual period. The endometrium builds up again in preparation for implantation. Part of the uterus, called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina.<br/>The <b>vagina </b>is a muscular tube that serves several purposes. It allows menstrual flow to leave the body. It is the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and the pathway for the delivery of offspring.</p><p class="s20">488                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 18 | Animal Reproduction and Development</p><p><span><IMG width="604" height="253" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_704.png"/></span></p><p class="s60">Female Reproductive Anatomy</p><p class="s52">Organ                     Location                                              Function</p><p>Clitoris                                  External            Sensory organ<br/>Mons pubis                           External            Fatty area overlying pubic bone<br/>Labia majora                         External            Covers labia minora; contains sweat and sebaceous glands<br/>Labia minora                        External            Covers vestibule<br/>Greater vestibular glands  External            Secrete mucus; lubricate  vagina Breast                               External            Produces and delivers  milk Ovaries                              Internal             Produce and develop eggs<br/>Oviducts                                Internal             Transport egg to uterus; site of fertilization<br/>Uterus                                    Internal             Supports developing embryo<br/>Vagina                                   Internal             Common tube for intercourse, birth canal, passing menstrual flow</p><p class="s17">Table 18.2</p><p class="s24">Gametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis)</p><p>Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, involves the process of meiosis.

However, the meiotic division is arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage. At the time of birth, all future eggs are in prophase I. This situation is in contrast with the male reproductive system in which sperm are produced continuously throughout the life of the individual. Starting at adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a few follicles in an ovary each month. This results in a primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division. The cell divides unequally, with most of the cytoplasm and organelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm going to the other cell. This second cell is called a polar body and usually dies. Cell division is again arrested, this time at metaphase II. At ovulation, this secondary oocyte is released and travels toward the uterus through the oviduct. If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through meiosis II, producing a second polar body and haploid egg, which fuses with the haploid sperm to form a fertilized egg (zygote) containing all 46 chromosomes.</p><p class="s24">Hormonal  Control of Reproduction</p><p>The human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary gland. When the reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a <b>gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) </b>to the anterior pituitary. This causes the release of <b>follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) </b>and <b>luteinizing hormone (LH) </b>from the anterior pituitary into the blood. Although these hormones are named after their functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction. Other hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems.</p><p class="s34">Male Hormones</p><p>At the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time. FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells located in the walls of the seminiferous tubules to begin promoting spermatogenesis (<span class="s32">Figure 18.16</span>). LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig, located in between the walls of the seminiferous tubules, to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood.</p><p class="s27">Testosterone <span class="p">stimulates spermatogenesis. This hormone is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence. The secondary sex characteristics in males include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial, axillary, and pubic hair, an increase in muscle bulk, and the beginnings of the sex drive.</span></p><p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 18 | Animal Reproduction and Development                                                                                                                                                       491</p><p><span><IMG width="525" height="224" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_709.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 18.16  <span class="s30">Hormones control sperm production in a negative feedback system.</span></p><p>A negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH. In addition, the Sertoli cells produce the hormone <b>inhibin</b>, which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high. This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down. If the sperm count reaches a low of 20 million/mL, the Sertoli cells cease the release of inhibin, and the sperm count increases.</p><p class="s24">Female Hormones</p><p>The control of reproduction in females is more complex. The female reproductive cycle is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle. The <b>ovarian cycle </b>governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the <b>menstrual cycle </b>governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining (<span class="s32">Figure 18.17</span>). These cycles are coordinated over a 22–32 day cycle, with an average length of 28 days.<br/>As with the male, the GnRH from the hypothalamus causes the release of the hormones FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary. In addition, <b>estrogen </b>and <b>progesterone </b>are released from the developing follicles. As with testosterone in males, estrogen is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females. These include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a shorter period for bone growth.</p><p class="s34">The Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle</p><p>The ovarian and menstrual cycles are regulated by hormones of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries (<span class="s32">Figure 18.17</span>). The ebb and flow of the hormones causes the ovarian and menstrual cycles to advance. The ovarian and menstrual cycles occur concurrently. The first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase. Slowly rising levels of FSH cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow, they begin releasing estrogen. The first few days of this cycle coincide with menstruation or the sloughing off of the functional layer of the endometrium in the uterus. After about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated during the end of the last cycle.</p><p class="s20">492                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 18 | Animal Reproduction and Development</p><p class="s29">Figure  18.17  <span class="s30">The ovarian  and  menstrual cycles  of female  reproduction are  regulated by hormones produced by the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries.</span></p><p>Which of the following statements about  hormone regulation of the female  reproductive cycle is false?<br/>a.

The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of further FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The inhibition of FSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated.

The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. The decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and starting the cycles again.</p><p class="s16">Reproductive Endocrinologist</p><p>A  reproductive  endocrinologist  is  a  physician  who  treats  a  variety  of  hormonal disorders  related  to reproduction and  infertility in both  men  and  women.  The  disorders include  menstrual problems, infertility, pregnancy loss,  sexual dysfunction, and  menopause. Doctors  may use  fertility drugs,  surgery, or assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in their therapy. ART involves  the use  of procedures to manipulate the egg or sperm to facilitate reproduction, such  as <i>in vitro </i>fertilization.<br/>Reproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical  training, first in a four-year  residency in obstetrics and  gynecology, then  in a three-year fellowship in reproductive endocrinology. To be board  certified in this area, the physician must pass written and oral exams in both areas.</p><p class="s24">Gestation</p><p>Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual. The length of time of</p><p class="s27">gestation<span class="p">, or the </span>gestation period<span class="p">, in humans is 266 days and is similar in other great apes.</span></p><p>Within 24 hours of fertilization, the egg nucleus has finished meiosis and the egg and sperm nuclei fuse. With fusion, the cell is known as a zygote. The zygote initiates cleavage and the developing embryo travels through the oviduct to the uterus. The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of the developing embryo or blastocyst grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone called <b>human beta chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG)</b>, which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active. This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo. Pregnancy tests determine the level of β-HCG in urine or serum. If the hormone is present, the test is positive.<br/>The gestation period is divided into three equal periods or trimesters. During the first two-to-four weeks of the first trimester, nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion. As the trimester progresses, the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium, and the placenta forms. The <b>placenta </b>takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus, with the mother’s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it. Chemicals from the fetus, such as bilirubin, are processed by the mother’s liver for elimination. Some of the mother’s immunoglobulins will pass through the placenta, providing passive immunity against some potential infections.<br/>Internal organs and body structures begin to develop during the first trimester. By five weeks, limb buds, eyes, the heart, and liver have been basically formed. By eight weeks, the term fetus applies, and the body is essentially formed (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">18.18<span style=" color: #000;">a</span><span class="p">). The individual is about five centimeters (two inches) in length and many of the organs, such as the lungs and liver, are not yet functioning. Exposure to any toxins is especially dangerous during the first trimester, as all of the body’s organs and structures are going through initial development. Anything that interferes with chemical signaling during that development can have a severe effect on the fetus’ survival.</span></p><p class="s20">494                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 18 | Animal Reproduction and Development</p><p><span><IMG width="451" height="201" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_712.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  18.18  <span class="s30">(a)  Fetal  development is shown  at  nine  weeks gestation.

It becomes active and the mother usually feels the first movements. All organs and structures continue to develop. The placenta has taken over the functions of nutrition and waste elimination and the production of estrogen and progesterone from the corpus luteum, which has degenerated. The placenta will continue functioning up through the delivery of the baby. During the third trimester, the fetus grows to 3 to 4 kg (6.5–8.5 lbs.) and about 50 cm (19–20 inches) long (<span class="s32">Figure 18.18</span><b>c</b>). This is the period of the most rapid growth during the pregnancy as all organ systems continue to grow and develop.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_714.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/embryo_fetus2" class="s25">Visit </a>this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/embryo_fetus2) <span class="p">to see the stages of human fetal development.</span></p><p>Labor is the muscular contractions to expel the fetus and placenta from the uterus. Toward the end of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin. At this time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening). This causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin causes smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells are recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force.<br/>There are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the baby and placenta to be expelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage two, the baby is expelled from the uterus. The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall. If labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as Pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain labor.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 18 | Animal Reproduction and Development                                                                                                                                                       495</p><p class="s24">KEY TERMS</p><p class="s27">asexual reproduction <span class="p">a mechanism that produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent</span></p><p class="s27">blastocyst <span class="p">the structure formed when cells in the mammalian blastula separate into an inner and outer layer</span></p><p class="s27">budding <span class="p">a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of an organism leading to a separation from the original animal into two individuals</span></p><p class="s27">bulbourethral gland   <span class="p">the paired glands in the human male that produce a secretion that cleanses the urethra prior to ejaculation</span></p><p class="s27">clitoris <span class="p">a sensory and erectile structure in female mammals, homologous to the male penis, stimulated during  sexual arousal</span></p><p class="s27">corpus luteum   <span class="p">the endocrine tissue that develops from an ovarian follicle after ovulation;

Asexual reproduction in animals occurs through fission, budding, fragmentation, and parthenogenesis. Sexual reproduction may involve fertilization inside the body or in the external environment. A species may have separate sexes or combined sexes; when the sexes are combined they may be expressed at different times in the life cycle. The sex of an individual may be determined by various chromosomal systems or environmental factors such as temperature.<br/>Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur either outside the bodies or inside the female. The method of fertilization varies among animals. Some species release the egg and sperm into the environment, some species retain the egg and receive the sperm into the female body and then expel the developing embryo covered with shell, while still other species retain the developing offspring throughout the gestation period.</p><p class="s52">18.2 Development and Organogenesis</p><p>The early stages of embryonic development begin with fertilization. The process of fertilization is tightly controlled to ensure that only one sperm fuses with one egg. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes cleavage to form the blastula. The blastula, which in some species is a hollow ball of cells, undergoes a process called gastrulation, during which the three germ layers form. The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermal skin cells, the mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body, and the endoderm gives rise to the digestive system and other internal organs. Organogenesis is the formation of organs from the germ layers. Each germ layer gives rise to specific tissue types.</p><p class="s52">18.3 Human Reproduction</p><p>The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the growth and development of offspring. Gametogenesis, the production of sperm (spermatogenesis) and eggs (oogenesis), takes place through the process of meiosis.<br/>The male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by hormones released from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary and hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. The hypothalamus monitors the need for FSH and LH production and release from the anterior pituitary. FSH and LH affect reproductive structures to cause the formation of sperm and the preparation of eggs for release and possible fertilization. In the male, FSH and LH stimulate Sertoli cells and interstitial cells of Leydig in the testes to facilitate sperm production. The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which also is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of males. In females, FSH and LH cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced. They regulate the female reproductive cycle, which is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle.<br/>Human pregnancy begins with fertilization of an egg and proceeds through the three trimesters of gestation. The first trimester lays down the basic structures of the body, including the limb buds, heart, eyes, and the liver. The second trimester continues the development of all of the organs and systems. The third trimester exhibits the greatest growth of the fetus and culminates in labor and delivery. The labor process has three stages (contractions, delivery of the fetus, and expulsion of the placenta), each propelled by hormones.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 18.12 </span><span class="p">Which of the following statements about the male reproductive system is false?</span></p><p>a.

This is a risk now on many rivers and canal systems in Illinois and Missouri because of the presence of Asian carp.<br/>This fish—actually a group of species including the silver, black, grass, and big head carp—has been farmed and eaten in China for over 1,000 years. It is one of the most important aquaculture food resources worldwide. In the United States, however, Asian carp is considered a dangerous invasive species that disrupts ecological community structure to the point of threatening native species.<br/>The effects of invasive species (such as the Asian carp, kudzu vine, predatory snakehead fish, and zebra mussel) are just one aspect of what ecologists study to understand how populations interact within ecological communities, and what impact natural and human-induced disturbances have on the characteristics of communities.</p><p class="s20">500                                                                                                                                                                               Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="134" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_717.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">19.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Population Demographics and Dynamics</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe how ecologists measure population size and density<br/>•   Describe three different patterns of population distribution<br/>•   Use life tables to calculate mortality rates<br/>•   Describe the three types of survivorship curves and relate them to specific populations<br/>Populations are dynamic entities. Their size and composition fluctuate in response to numerous factors, including seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within species. The statistical study of populations is called <b>demography</b>: a set of mathematical tools designed to describe populations and investigate how they change. Many of these tools were actually designed to study human populations. For example, <b>life tables</b>, which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates. In fact, while the term “demographics” is sometimes assumed to mean a study of human populations, all living populations can be studied using this approach.</p><p class="s24">Population Size  and Density</p><p>Populations are characterized by their <b>population size </b>(total number of individuals) and their <b>population density </b>(number of individuals per unit area). A population may have a large number of individuals that are distributed densely, or sparsely. There are also populations with small numbers of individuals that may be dense or very sparsely distributed in a local area. Population size can affect potential for adaptation because it affects the amount of genetic variation present in the population. Density can have effects on interactions within a population such as competition for food and the ability of individuals to find a mate. Smaller organisms tend to be more densely distributed than larger organisms (<span class="s32">Figure 19.2</span>).</p><p class="s29">Figure 19.2 <span class="s30">Australian  mammals show a typical inverse relationship between population  density  and body size.</span></p><p>As this graph  shows, population  density  typically decreases with increasing body  size.

However, this method is usually not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large areas. Thus, scientists usually<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology                                                                                                                                                                               501</p><p>study populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and use this sample to make inferences about the population as a whole. The methods used to sample populations to determine their size and density are typically tailored to the characteristics of the organism being studied. For immobile organisms such as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, a quadrat may be used. A <b>quadrat </b>is a wood, plastic, or metal square that is randomly located on the ground and used to count the number of individuals that lie within its boundaries. To obtain an accurate count using this method, the square must be placed at random locations within the habitat enough times to produce an accurate estimate. This counting method will provide an estimate of both population size and density. The number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of organisms and the nature of their distribution.<br/>For smaller mobile organisms, such as mammals, a technique called <b>mark and recapture </b>is often used. This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way and releasing them back into the environment to mix with the rest of the population; then, a new sample is captured and scientists determine how many of the marked animals are in the new sample. This method assumes that the larger the population, the lower the percentage of marked organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with more unmarked individuals. For example, if 80 field mice are captured, marked, and released into the forest, then a second trapping 100 field mice are captured and 20 of them are marked, the population size (<i>N</i>) can be determined using the following equation:</p><p class="s81">number marked first catch × total number second catch<span class="s11">  =  </span><i>N</i></p><p class="s11">number marked second catch</p><p>Using our example, the population size would be 400.</p><p class="s81">80 × 100</p><p class="s11">20</p><p class="s11">=  400</p><p>These results give us an estimate of 400 total individuals in the original population. The true number usually will be a bit different from this because of chance errors and possible bias caused by the sampling methods.</p><p class="s24">Species Distribution</p><p>In addition to measuring density, further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals throughout their range. A <b>species distribution pattern </b>is the distribution of individuals within a habitat at a particular point in time—broad categories of patterns are used to describe them.<br/>Individuals within a population can be distributed at random, in groups, or equally spaced apart (more or less). These are known as random, clumped, and uniform distribution patterns, respectively (<span class="s32">Figure 19.3</span>). Different distributions reflect important aspects of the biology of the species; they also affect the mathematical methods required to estimate population sizes. An example of random distribution occurs with dandelion and other plants that have wind-dispersed seeds that germinate wherever they happen to fall in favorable environments. A clumped distribution, may be seen in plants that drop their seeds straight to the ground, such as oak trees; it can also be seen in animals that live in social groups (schools of fish or herds of elephants). Uniform distribution is observed in plants that secrete substances inhibiting the growth of nearby individuals (such as the release of toxic chemicals by sage plants). It is also seen in territorial animal species, such as penguins that maintain a defined territory for nesting. The territorial defensive behaviors of each individual create a regular pattern of distribution of similar-sized territories and individuals within those territories. Thus, the distribution of the individuals within a population provides more information about how they interact with each other than does a simple density measurement. Just as lower density species might have more difficulty finding a mate, solitary species with a random distribution might have a similar difficulty when compared to social species clumped together in groups.</p><p class="s20">502                                                                                                                                                                               Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="202" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_719.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.3  <span class="s30">Species may have  a random, clumped, or uniform distribution.

Demography is the statistical study of population changes over time: birth rates, death rates, and life expectancies. These population characteristics are often displayed in a life table.</p><p class="s34">Life Tables</p><p>Life tables provide important information about the life history of an organism and the life expectancy of individuals at each age. They are modeled after actuarial tables used by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy. Life tables may include the probability of each age group dying before their next birthday, the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval (their <b>mortality rate</b>, and their life expectancy at each interval. An example of a life table is shown in <span class="s32">Table 19.1 </span>from a study of Dall mountain sheep, a species native to northwestern North America. Notice that the population is divided into age intervals (column A). The mortality rate (per 1000) shown in column D is based on the number of individuals dying during the age interval (column B), divided by the number of individuals surviving at the beginning of the interval (Column C) multiplied by 1000.<br/><span><IMG width="174" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_720.png"/></span></p><p class="s11">mortality rate  =     number of individuals dying number of individuals surviving</p><p class="s11">× 1000</p><p>For example, between ages three and four, 12 individuals die out of the 776 that were remaining from the original 1000 sheep.

These curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations (<span class="s32">Figure 19.4</span>). There are three types of survivorship curves. In a type I curve, mortality is low in the early and middle years and occurs mostly in older individuals. Organisms exhibiting a type I survivorship typically produce few offspring and provide good care to the offspring increasing the likelihood of their survival. Humans and most mammals exhibit a type I survivorship curve. In type II curves, mortality is relatively constant throughout the entire life span, and mortality is equally likely to occur at any point in the life span. Many bird populations provide examples of an intermediate or type II survivorship curve. In type III survivorship curves, early ages experience the highest mortality with much lower mortality rates for organisms that make it to advanced years. Type III organisms typically produce large numbers of offspring, but provide very little or no care for them. Trees and marine invertebrates exhibit a type III survivorship curve because very few of these organisms survive their younger years, but those that do make it to an old age are more likely to survive for a relatively long period of time.<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_722.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">1.

An accurate model should be able to describe the changes occurring in a population and predict future changes.</p><p class="s24">Population Growth</p><p>The two simplest models of population growth use deterministic equations (equations that do not account for random events) to describe the rate of change in the size of a population over time. The first of these models, exponential growth, describes theoretical populations that increase in numbers without any limits to their growth. The second model, logistic growth, introduces limits to reproductive growth that become more intense as the population size increases. Neither model adequately describes natural populations, but they provide points of comparison.</p><p class="s34">Exponential Growth</p><p>Charles Darwin, in developing his theory of natural selection, was influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus. Malthus published his book in 1798 stating that populations with abundant natural resources grow very rapidly; however, they limit further growth by depleting their resources. The early pattern of accelerating population size is called <b>exponential growth</b>.<br/>The best example of exponential growth in organisms is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce largely by binary fission. This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an abundant supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become quickly depleted), the number of bacteria will have doubled from 1000 to 2000 after just an hour. In another hour, each of the 2000 bacteria will divide, producing 4000 bacteria. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask. The important concept of exponential growth is that the growth rate—the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation—is itself increasing; that is, the<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology                                                                                                                                                                               505</p><p>population size is increasing at a greater and greater rate. After 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion bacteria. When the population size, <i>N</i>, is plotted over time, a <b>J-shaped growth curve </b>is produced (<span class="s32">Figure 19.5</span><b>a</b>).<br/>The bacteria-in-a-flask example is not truly representative of the real world where resources are usually limited. However, when a species is introduced into a new habitat that it finds suitable, it may show exponential growth for a while. In the case of the bacteria in the flask, some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce; therefore, the growth rate is lowered from a maximal rate in which there is no mortality. The growth rate of a population is largely determined by subtracting the <b>death rate</b>, <i>D</i>, (number organisms that die during an interval) from the <b>birth rate</b>, <i>B</i>, (number organisms that are born during an interval). The growth rate can be expressed in a simple equation that combines the birth and death rates into a single factor: <i>r</i>. This is shown in the following formula:</p><p class="s11">Population growth  =  <i>rN</i></p><p>The value of <i>r </i>can be positive, meaning the population is increasing in size (the rate of change is positive); or negative, meaning the population is decreasing in size; or zero, in which case the population size is unchanging, a condition known as <b>zero population growth</b>.</p><p class="s24">Logistic Growth</p><p>Extended exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world. Charles Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the “struggle for existence,” which states that individuals will compete (with members of their own or other species) for limited resources. The successful ones are more likely to survive and pass on the traits that made them successful to the next generation at a greater rate (natural selection). To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the <b>logistic growth </b>model.</p><p class="s34">Carrying Capacity and the Logistic Model</p><p>In the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur in environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large enough, resources will be depleted and the growth rate will slow down. Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (<span class="s32">Figure 19.5</span><b>b</b>). This population size, which is determined by the maximum population size that a particular environment can sustain, is called the <b>carrying capacity</b>, or <i>K</i>. In real populations, a growing population often overshoots its carrying capacity, and the death rate increases beyond the birth rate causing the population size to decline back to the carrying capacity or below it. Most populations usually fluctuate around the carrying capacity in an undulating fashion rather than existing right at it.<br/>The formula used to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. The expression “<i>K </i>– <i>N</i>” is equal to the number of individuals that may be added to a population at a given time, and “<i>K </i>– <i>N</i>” divided by “<i>K</i>” is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. Thus, the exponential growth model is restricted by this factor to generate the logistic growth equation:</p><p class="s83"><span class="s11">Population growth  =  </span><span class="s82">rN </span><span class="s10">⎡</span>K <span class="s81">− </span>N<span class="s82"> </span><span class="s10">⎤</span></p><p class="s10">⎣    <span class="s82">K    </span>⎦</p><p>Notice that when <i>N </i>is almost zero the quantity in brackets is almost equal to 1 (or <i>K</i>/<i>K</i>) and growth is close to exponential. When the population size is equal to the carrying capacity, or <i>N </i>= <i>K</i>, the quantity in brackets is equal to zero and growth is equal to zero. A graph of this equation (logistic growth) yields the <b>S-shaped curve </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 19.5</span><b>b</b>). It is a more realistic model of population growth than exponential growth. There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve. Initially, growth is exponential because there are few individuals and ample resources available. Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases. Finally, the growth rate levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population number over time.</p><p class="s20">506                                                                                                                                                                               Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology</p><p><span><IMG width="449" height="222" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_725.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.5  <span class="s30">When  resources are  unlimited,  populations exhibit (a) exponential growth,  shown  in a J-shaped curve. When resources are limited, populations exhibit (b) logistic growth. In logistic growth, population  expansion decreases as resources become scarce, and  it levels  off when  the carrying  capacity of the environment is reached. The logistic growth curve is S-shaped.</span></p><p class="s34">Role  of Intraspecific Competition</p><p>The logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal chance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.<br/>In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition for resources among population members of the same species is termed <b>intraspecific competition</b>. Intraspecific competition may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity, as resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need. However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. In addition, the accumulation of waste products can reduce carrying capacity in an environment.</p><p class="s34">Examples of Logistic Growth</p><p>Yeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages, exhibits the classical S-shaped curve when grown in a test tube (<span class="s32">Figure 19.6</span><b>a</b>). Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth. In the real world, however, there are variations to this idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (<span class="s32">Figure 19.6</span><b>b</b>). In both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity afterwards. This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around its carrying capacity. Still, even with this oscillation, the logistic model is confirmed.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology                                                                                                                                                                               507</p><p class="s29">Figure  19.6  <span class="s30">(a) Yeast  grown in ideal conditions in a test  tube  shows a classical S-shaped logistic growth curve, whereas (b) a natural  population  of seals shows real-world  fluctuation.

Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change, which is not the case. The carrying capacity varies annually. For example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet; in many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer. Also, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity.</p><p class="s20">508                                                                                                                                                                               Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology</p><p>Additionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. They share the environment with other species, competing with them for the same resources (interspecific competition). These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow.<br/>Population growth is regulated in a variety of ways. These are grouped into <b>density-dependent </b>factors, in which the density of the population affects growth rate and mortality, and <b>density-independent </b>factors, which cause mortality in a population regardless of population density. Wildlife biologists, in particular, want to understand both types because this helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation.</p><p class="s24">Density-dependent Regulation</p><p>Most density-dependent factors are biological in nature and include predation, inter- and intraspecific competition, and parasites. Usually, the denser a population is, the greater its mortality rate. For example, during intra- and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the species will usually be lower, reducing their populations’ rate of growth. In addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it has more difficulty locating its food source. Also, when the population is denser, diseases spread more rapidly among the members of the population, which affect the mortality rate.<br/>Density dependent regulation was studied in a natural experiment with wild donkey populations on two sites in Australia.</p><p class="s55">[2]</p><p>On one site the population was reduced by a population control program; the population on the other site received no interference. The high-density plot was twice as dense as the low-density plot. From 1986 to 1987 the high-density plot saw no change in donkey density, while the low-density plot saw an increase in donkey density. The difference in the growth rates of the two populations was caused by mortality, not by a difference in birth rates. The researchers found that numbers of offspring birthed by each mother was unaffected by density. Growth rates in the two populations were different mostly because of juvenile mortality caused by the mother’s malnutrition due to scarce high-quality food in the dense population. <span class="s32">Figure 19.7 </span>shows the difference in age-specific mortalities in the two populations.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="223" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_727.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 19.7 <span class="s30">This graph  shows the age-specific mortality rates for wild donkeys from high- and low-density  populations. The  juvenile  mortality  is much  higher  in the  high-density population  because of maternal malnutrition  caused by a shortage of high-quality food.</span></p><p class="s24">Density-independent Regulation and Interaction with Density- dependent Factors</p><p>Many factors that are typically physical in nature cause mortality of a population regardless of its density. These factors include weather, natural disasters, and pollution. An individual deer will be killed in a forest fire regardless of how many deer happen to be in that area. Its chances of survival are the same whether the population density is high or low. The same holds true for cold winter weather.<br/>In real-life situations, population regulation is very complicated and density-dependent and independent factors can interact. A dense population that suffers mortality from a density-independent cause will be able to recover differently than a sparse population. For example, a population of deer affected by a harsh winter will recover faster if there are more deer remaining to reproduce.<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_728.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">2.

These adaptations impact the kind of population growth their species experience. Life history characteristics such as birth rates, age at first reproduction, the numbers of offspring, and even death rates evolve just like anatomy or behavior, leading to adaptations that affect population growth. Population ecologists have described a continuum of life-history “strategies” with <i>K</i>-selected species on one end and <i>r</i>-selected species on the other. <i><b>K</b></i><b>-selected species </b>are adapted to stable, predictable environments. Populations of <i>K</i>-selected species tend to exist close to their carrying capacity. These species tend to have larger, but fewer, offspring and contribute large amounts of resources to each offspring. Elephants would be an example of a <i>K</i>-selected species. <i><b>r</b></i><b>-selected species </b>are adapted to unstable and unpredictable environments. They have large numbers of small offspring. Animals that are <i>r</i>-selected do not provide a lot of resources or parental care to offspring, and the offspring are relatively self-sufficient at birth. Examples of <i>r</i>-selected species are marine invertebrates such as jellyfish and plants such as the dandelion. The two extreme strategies are at two ends of a continuum on which real species life histories will exist. In addition, life history strategies do not need to evolve as suites, but can evolve independently of each other, so each species may have some characteristics that trend toward one extreme or the other.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="134" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_731.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">19.3 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>The Human Population</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Discuss how human population growth can be exponential<br/>•   Explain how humans have expanded the carrying capacity of their habitat<br/>•   Relate population growth and age structure to the level of economic development in different countries<br/>•   Discuss the long-term implications of unchecked human population growth<br/>Concepts of animal population dynamics can be applied to human population growth. Humans are not unique in their ability to alter their environment. For example, beaver dams alter the stream environment where they are built. Humans, however, have the ability to alter their environment to increase its carrying capacity, sometimes to the detriment of other species. Earth’s human population and their use of resources are growing rapidly, to the extent that some worry about the ability of Earth’s environment to sustain its human population. Long-term exponential growth carries with it the potential risks of famine, disease, and large-scale death, as well as social consequences of crowding such as increased crime.<br/>Human technology and particularly our harnessing of the energy contained in fossil fuels have caused unprecedented changes to Earth’s environment, altering ecosystems to the point where some may be in danger of collapse.

This ability is responsible for human population growth because it resets the carrying capacity and overcomes density-dependent growth regulation. Much of this ability is related to human intelligence, society, and communication. Humans construct shelters to protect themselves from the elements and have developed agriculture and domesticated animals to increase their food supplies. In addition, humans use language to communicate this technology to new generations, allowing them to improve upon previous accomplishments.<br/>Other factors in human population growth are migration and public health. Humans originated in Africa, but we have since migrated to nearly all inhabitable land on Earth, thus, increasing the area that we have colonized. Public health, sanitation, and the use of antibiotics and vaccines have decreased the ability of infectious disease to limit human population growth in developed countries. In the past, diseases such as the bubonic plaque of the fourteenth century killed between 30 and<br/>60 percent of Europe’s population and reduced the overall world population by as many as one hundred million people. Infectious disease continues to have an impact on human population growth. For example, life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa, which was increasing from 1950 to 1990, began to decline after 1985 largely as a result of HIV/AIDS mortality. The</p><p class="s55">[5]</p><p>reduction in life expectancy caused by HIV/AIDS was estimated to be 7 years for 2005.<br/>Declining life expectancy is an indicator of higher mortality rates and leads to lower birth rates.<br/>The fundamental cause of the acceleration of growth rate for humans in the past 200 years has been the reduced death rate due to a development of the technological advances of the industrial age, urbanization that supported those technologies, and especially the exploitation of the energy in fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are responsible for dramatically increasing the resources available for human population growth through agriculture (mechanization, pesticides, and fertilizers) and harvesting wild populations.</p><p class="s24">Age Structure, Population Growth, and Economic Development</p><p>The age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics. <b>Age structure </b>is the proportion of a population in different age classes. Models that incorporate age structure allow better prediction of population growth, plus the ability to associate this growth with the level of economic development in a region. Countries with rapid growth have a pyramidal shape in their age structure diagrams, showing a preponderance of younger individuals, many of whom are of reproductive age (<span class="s32">Figure 19.11</span>). This pattern is most often observed in underdeveloped countries where individuals do not live to old age because of less-than-optimal living conditions, and there is a high birth rate. Age structures of areas with slow growth, including developed countries such as the United States, still have a pyramidal structure, but with many fewer young and reproductive-aged individuals and a greater proportion of older individuals. Other developed countries, such as Italy, have zero population growth. The age structure of these populations is more conical, with an even greater percentage of middle-aged and older individuals. The actual growth rates in different countries are shown in <span class="s32">Figure 19.12</span>, with the highest rates tending to be in the less economically developed countries of Africa and Asia.<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_736.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">5.

Ehrlich wrote, “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.</p><p class="s55">[6]</p><p>At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.”<br/>While many critics view this statement<br/>as an exaggeration, the laws of exponential population growth are still in effect, and unchecked human population growth cannot continue indefinitely.<br/>Efforts to moderate population control led to the <b>one-child policy </b>in China, which imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child. Due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir, many Chinese couples continue to have more than one child. The effectiveness of the policy in limiting overall population growth is controversial, as is the policy itself. Moreover, there are stories of female infanticide having occurred in some of the more rural areas of the country. Family planning education programs in other countries have had highly positive effects on limiting population growth rates and increasing standards of living. In spite of population control policies, the human population continues to grow. Because of the subsequent need to produce more and more food to feed our population, inequalities in access to food and other resources will continue to widen. The United Nations estimates the future world population size could vary from 6 billion (a<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_739.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">6.

There is no way to know whether human population growth will moderate to the point where the crisis described by Dr. Ehrlich will be averted.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_740.jpg"/></span><br/>Another consequence of population growth is the change and degradation of the natural environment. Many countries have attempted to reduce the human impact on climate change by limiting their emission of greenhouse gases. However, a global climate change treaty remains elusive, and many underdeveloped countries trying to improve their economic condition may be less likely to agree with such provisions without compensation if it means slowing their economic development. Furthermore, the role of human activity in causing climate change has become a hotly debated socio-political issue in some developed countries, including the United States. Thus, we enter the future with considerable uncertainty about our ability to curb human population growth and protect our environment to maintain the carrying capacity for the human species.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_741.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/populations2" class="s25">Visit  this  </a>website  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/populations2)  <span class="p">and  select  “Launch  the  movie”  for  an  animation discussing the global impacts of human population growth.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="155" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_742.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">19.4 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Community Ecology</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Discuss the predator-prey cycle<br/>•   Give examples of defenses against predation and herbivory<br/>•   Describe the competitive exclusion principle<br/>•   Give examples of symbiotic relationships between species<br/>•   Describe community structure and succession<br/>In general, populations of one species never live in isolation from populations of other species. The interacting populations occupying a given habitat form an ecological community. The number of species occupying the same habitat and their relative abundance is known as the diversity of the community. Areas with low species diversity, such as the glaciers of Antarctica, still contain a wide variety of living organisms, whereas the diversity of tropical rainforests is so great that it cannot be accurately assessed. Scientists study ecology at the community level to understand how species interact with each other and compete for the same resources.</p><p class="s24">Predation and Herbivory</p><p>Perhaps the classical example of species interaction is the predator-prey relationship. The narrowest definition of the predator-prey interaction describes individuals of one population that kill and then consume the individuals of another population. Population sizes of predators and prey in a community are not constant over time, and they may vary in cycles that appear to be related. The most often cited example of predator-prey population dynamics is seen in the cycling of the lynx (predator) and the snowshoe hare (prey), using 100 years of trapping data from North America (<span class="s32">Figure 19.13</span>). This cycling of predator and prey population sizes has a period of approximately ten years, with the predator population lagging one to two years behind the prey population. An apparent explanation for this pattern is that as the hare numbers increase, there is more food available for the lynx, allowing the lynx population to increase as well. When the lynx population grows to a threshold level, however, they kill so many hares that hare numbers begin to decline, followed by a decline in the lynx population because of scarcity of food. When the lynx population is low, the hare population size begins to increase due, in part, to low predation pressure, starting the cycle anew.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology                                                                                                                                                                               515</p><p><span><IMG width="424" height="218" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_743.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.13  <span class="s30">The cycling of snowshoe hare  and  lynx populations in Northern  Ontario  is an example of predator-prey dynamics.</span></p><p class="s34">Defense Mechanisms against Predation and Herbivory</p><p>Predation and predator avoidance are strong selective agents. Any heritable character that allows an individual of a prey population to better evade its predators will be represented in greater numbers in later generations. Likewise, traits that allow a predator to more efficiently locate and capture its prey will lead to a greater number of offspring and an increase in the commonness of the trait within the population. Such ecological relationships between specific populations lead to adaptations that are driven by reciprocal evolutionary responses in those populations. Species have evolved numerous mechanisms to escape predation and herbivory (the consumption of plants for food). Defenses may be mechanical, chemical, physical, or behavioral.<br/>Mechanical defenses, such as the presence of armor in animals or thorns in plants, discourage predation and herbivory by discouraging physical contact (<span class="s32">Figure 19.14</span><b>a</b>). Many animals produce or obtain chemical defenses from plants and store them to prevent predation. Many plant species produce secondary plant compounds that serve no function for the plant except that they are toxic to animals and discourage consumption. For example, the foxglove produces several compounds, including digitalis, that are extremely toxic when eaten (<span class="s32">Figure 19.14</span><b>b</b>). (Biomedical scientists have purposed the chemical produced by foxglove as a heart medication, which has saved lives for many decades.)<br/><span><IMG width="472" height="219" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_744.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.14  <span class="s30">The (a) honey  locust  tree  uses thorns, a mechanical defense, against herbivores, while the (b) foxglove uses a  chemical defense:  toxins  produces by  the  plant  can  cause nausea, vomiting,  hallucinations, convulsions, or death when  consumed.

The tropical walking stick is an insect with the coloration and body shape of a twig, which makes it very hard to see when it is stationary against a background of real twigs (<span class="s32">Figure 19.15</span><b>a</b>). In another example, the chameleon can change its color to match its surroundings (<span class="s32">Figure 19.15</span><b>b</b>).</p><p class="s20">516                                                                                                                                                                               Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology</p><p><span><IMG width="521" height="184" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_745.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.15  <span class="s30">(a) The tropical walking stick and  (b) the chameleon use  their body shape and/or  coloration  to prevent detection by predators.

For example, the monarch butterfly caterpillar sequesters poisons from its food (plants and milkweeds) to make itself poisonous or distasteful to potential predators. The caterpillar is bright yellow and black to advertise its toxicity. The caterpillar is also able to pass the sequestered toxins on to the adult monarch, which is also dramatically colored black and red as a warning to potential predators. Fire-bellied toads produce toxins that make them distasteful to their potential predators. They have bright red or orange coloration on their bellies, which they display to a potential predator to advertise their poisonous nature and discourage an attack. These are only two examples of warning coloration, which is a relatively common adaptation. Warning coloration only works if a predator uses eyesight to locate prey and can learn—a naïve predator must experience the negative consequences of eating one before it will avoid other similarly colored individuals (<span class="s32">Figure 19.16</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="298" height="224" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_746.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.16  <span class="s30">The  fire-bellied  toad  has  bright coloration  on its belly that  serves to warn  potential  predators that  it is toxic. (credit: modification of work by Roberto Verzo)</span></p><p>While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration, other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals. In some cases of <b>mimicry</b>, a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful species. Assuming they share the same predators, this coloration then protects the harmless ones. Many insect species mimic the coloration of wasps, which are stinging, venomous insects, thereby discouraging predation (<span class="s32">Figure 19.17</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology                                                                                                                                                                               517</p><p><span><IMG width="495" height="223" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_747.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  19.17  </span>One  form of mimicry is when  a harmless species mimics the coloration  of a harmful species, as is seen with the (a) wasp  (<i>Polistes </i>sp.) and the (b) hoverfly (<i>Syrphus </i>sp.).

Ecologists have come to understand that all species have an ecological niche. A niche is the unique set of resources used by a species, which includes its interactions with other species. The <b>competitive exclusion principle </b>states that two species cannot occupy the same niche in a habitat: in other words, different species cannot coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources. This principle works because if there is an overlap in resource use and therefore competition between two species, then traits that lessen reliance on the shared resource will be selected for leading to evolution that reduces the overlap. If either species is unable to evolve to reduce competition, then the species that most efficiently exploits the resource will drive the other species to extinction. An experimental example of this principle is shown in <span class="s32">Figure 19.19 </span>with two protozoan species: <i>Paramecium aurelia </i>and <i>Paramecium caudatum</i>. When grown individually in the laboratory, they both thrive. But when they are placed together in the same test tube (habitat), <i>P. aurelia </i>outcompetes <i>P. caudatum </i>for food, leading to the latter’s eventual extinction.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="182" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_751.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s35"><span class="s29">Figure  19.19  </span>Paramecium aurelia <span class="s30">and  </span>Paramecium caudatum <span class="s30">grow well individually, but when  they compete for the same resources, the </span>P. aurelia <span class="s30">outcompetes the </span>P. caudatum<span class="s30">.</span></p><p class="s24">Symbiosis</p><p>Symbiotic relationships are close, long-term interactions between individuals of different species. Symbioses may be commensal, in which one species benefits while the other is neither harmed nor benefited; mutualistic, in which both species benefit; or parasitic, in which the interaction harms one species and benefits the other.</p><p class="s34">Commensalism</p><p>A commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from a close prolonged interaction, while the other neither benefits nor is harmed. Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship (<span class="s32">Figure 19.20</span>). The tree is not harmed by the presence of the nest among its branches. The nests are light and produce little strain on the structural integrity of the branch, and most of the leaves, which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are above the nest so they are unaffected. The bird, on the other hand, benefits greatly. If the bird had to nest in the open, its eggs and young would be vulnerable to predators. Many potential commensal relationships are difficult to identify because it is difficult to prove that one partner does not derive some benefit from the presence of the other.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology                                                                                                                                                                               519</p><p><span><IMG width="278" height="276" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_752.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.20  <span class="s30">The  southern masked-weaver is starting  to make  a nest  in a tree  in Zambezi Valley, Zambia.

For example, termites have a mutualistic relationship with protists that live in the insect’s gut (<span class="s32">Figure 19.21</span><b>a</b>). The termite benefits from the ability of the protists to digest cellulose. However, the protists are able to digest cellulose only because of the presence of symbiotic bacteria within their cells that produce the cellulase enzyme. The termite itself cannot do this: without the protozoa, it would not be able to obtain energy from its food (cellulose from the wood it chews and eats). The protozoa benefit by having a protective environment and a constant supply of food from the wood chewing actions of the termite. In turn, the protists benefit from the enzymes provided by their bacterial endosymbionts, while the bacteria benefit from a doubly protective environment and a constant source of nutrients from two hosts. Lichen are a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria (<span class="s32">Figure 19.21</span><b>b</b>). The glucose produced by the algae provides nourishment for both organisms, whereas the physical structure of the lichen protects the algae from the elements and makes certain nutrients in the atmosphere more available to the algae. The algae of lichens can live independently given the right environment, but many of the fungal partners are unable to live on their own.<br/><span><IMG width="533" height="192" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_753.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.21  <span class="s30">(a)  Termites form  a  mutualistic  relationship with symbiotic  protozoa in their  guts,  which  allow  both organisms to  obtain  energy from  the  cellulose the  termite  consumes.

In this relationship, the parasite benefits, but the organism being fed upon, the <b>host</b>, is harmed. The host is usually weakened by the parasite as it siphons resources the host would normally use to maintain itself. Parasites may kill their hosts, but there</p><p class="s20">520                                                                                                                                                                               Chapter 19 | Population and Community  Ecology</p><p>is usually selection to slow down this process to allow the parasite time to complete its reproductive cycle before it or its offspring are able to spread to another host.<br/>The reproductive cycles of parasites are often very complex, sometimes requiring more than one host species. A tapeworm causes disease in humans when contaminated, undercooked meat such as pork, fish, or beef is consumed (<span class="s32">Figure 19.22</span>). The tapeworm can live inside the intestine of the host for several years, benefiting from the host’s food, and it may grow to be over 50 feet long by adding segments. The parasite moves from one host species to a second host species in order to complete its life cycle. <i>Plasmodium falciparum </i>is another parasite: the protists that cause malaria, a significant disease in many parts of the world. Living inside human liver and red blood cells, the organism reproduces asexually in the human host and then sexually in the gut of blood-feeding mosquitoes to complete its life cycle. Thus malaria is spread from human to mosquito and back to human, one of many arthropod-borne infectious diseases of humans.<br/><span><IMG width="513" height="335" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_754.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_755.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.22  <span class="s30">This diagram shows the life cycle of the tapeworm, a human worm parasite.

Species richness varies across the globe (<span class="s32">Figure 19.23</span>). Ecologists have struggled to understand the determinants of biodiversity. Species richness is related to latitude: the greatest species richness occurs near the equator and the lowest richness occurs near the poles. Other factors influence species richness as well. <b>Island biogeography </b>attempts to explain the great species richness found in isolated islands, and has found relationships between species richness, island size, and distance from the mainland.</p><p class="s27">Relative species abundance <span class="p">is the number individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a system.

They are often primary producers, and they are typically an abundant organism. For example, kelp, a species of brown algae, is a foundation species that forms the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of California.</span></p><p>Foundation species may physically modify the environment to produce and maintain habitats that benefit the other organisms that use them. Examples include the kelp described above or tree species found in a forest. The photosynthetic corals of the coral reef also provide structure by physically modifying the environment (<span class="s32">Figure 19.24</span>). The exoskeletons of living and dead coral make up most of the reef structure, which protects many other species from waves and ocean currents.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="213" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_758.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 19.24  <span class="s30">Coral is the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems.

Studies have shown that when this organism is removed from communities, mussel populations (their natural prey) increase, which completely alters the species composition and reduces biodiversity. Another keystone species is the banded tetra, a fish in tropical streams, which supplies nearly all of the phosphorus, a necessary inorganic nutrient, to the rest of the community. The banded tetra feeds largely on insects from the terrestrial ecosystem and then excretes phosphorus into the aquatic ecosystem. The relationships between populations in the community, and possibly the biodiversity, would change dramatically if these fish were to become extinct.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="213" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_759.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure 19.25  </span>The <i>Pisaster ochraceus </i>sea star is a keystone species.

In the United States, invasive  species like the purple loosestrife (<i>Lythrum salicaria</i>) and  the  zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) have  altered aquatic ecosystems,  and  some forests are threatened by the spread of common buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus cathartica</i>) and garlic mustard (<i>Alliaria petiolata</i>). Some well-known invasive  animals include  the emerald ash  borer  (<i>Agrilus planipennis</i>) and  the European starling  (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>).  Whether enjoying  a  forest  hike,  taking  a  summer boat  trip, or simply  walking down an urban  street, you have  likely encountered an invasive  species.<br/>One  of the many  recent proliferations of an invasive  species concerns the Asian carp  in the United States. Asian carp  were  introduced to the United States in the 1970s by fisheries (commercial catfish  ponds) and by sewage treatment facilities that  used the  fish’s  excellent filter feeding  abilities  to clean  their  ponds of excess plankton.  Some of the fish escaped, and  by the 1980s they had  colonized many  waterways of the Mississippi  River basin, including the Illinois and Missouri Rivers.<br/>Voracious feeders and  rapid  reproducers, Asian  carp  may  outcompete native  species for food and  could lead to their extinction. One species, the grass carp, feeds on phytoplankton and aquatic plants.  It competes with native species for these resources and alters  nursery habitats for other fish by removing  aquatic plants. Another  species, the silver carp,  competes with native  fish that feed  on zooplankton. In some parts  of the Illinois River, Asian carp constitute 95 percent of the community&#39;s biomass. Although edible,  the fish is bony and  not desired in the United States. Moreover, their presence now threatens the native  fish and  fisheries of the Great  Lakes,  which are important  to local economies and recreational anglers. Asian carp have  even injured  humans. The  fish, frightened by the  sound of approaching motorboats, thrust  themselves into the air, often landing in the boat or directly hitting boaters.<br/>The Great  Lakes  and  their prized  salmon and  lake trout fisheries are  being  threatened by Asian carp.  The carp are not yet present in the Great  Lakes,  and attempts are being made to prevent its access to the lakes through  the Chicago Ship and  Sanitary Canal, which is the only connection between the Mississippi  River and Great  Lakes  basins. To prevent the Asian carp from leaving the canal, a series of electric barriers have been used to discourage their migration;  however, the threat  is significant  enough that  several states and Canada have  sued to have  the Chicago channel permanently cut off from Lake Michigan. Local and national politicians  have  weighed in on how to solve  the problem.  In general, governments have  been ineffective  in preventing or slowing the introduction  of invasive  species.<br/>The   issues  associated  with   Asian   carp   show   how   population    and   community    ecology,    fisheries management, and  politics intersect on issues of vital importance to the human food supply  and  economy. Socio-political  issues like the  Asian  carp  make  extensive use  of the  sciences of population  ecology,  the study  of members of a  particular  species occupying a  habitat;  and  community  ecology,  the  study  of the interaction of all species within a habitat.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="627" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_760.png"/></span></p><p class="s24">Community Dynamics</p><p>Community dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time, often following <b>environmental disturbances </b>such as volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, fires, and climate change. Communities with a relatively constant number of species are said to be at equilibrium. The equilibrium is dynamic with species identities and relationships changing over time, but maintaining relatively constant numbers. Following a disturbance, the community may or may not return to the equilibrium state.<br/>Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time after a severe disturbance. In <b>primary succession</b>, newly exposed or newly formed rock is colonized by living organisms; in <b>secondary succession</b>, a part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain. In both cases, there is a sequential change in species until a more or less permanent community develops.</p><p class="s34">Primary Succession and Pioneer Species</p><p>Primary succession occurs when new land is formed, for example, following the eruption of volcanoes, such as those on the<br/>Big Island of Hawaii.

These species help to further break down the mineral-rich lava into soil where other, less hardy but more competitive species, such as grasses, shrubs, and trees, will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species. Over time the area will reach an equilibrium state, with a set of organisms quite different from the pioneer species.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="234" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_761.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.26  <span class="s30">During primary  succession in lava  on Maui, Hawaii, succulent plants  are  the  pioneer species.  (credit: Forest and Kim Starr)</span></p><p class="s34">Secondary succession</p><p>A classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire (<span class="s32">Figure 19.27</span>). Wildfires will burn most vegetation, and unless the animals can flee the area, they are killed. Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form of ash. Thus, although the community has been dramatically altered, there is a soil ecosystem present that provides a foundation for rapid recolonization.<br/>Before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire, though, these trees are no longer dominant. Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due, at least in part, to changes in the environment brought on by the growth of grasses and forbs, over many years, shrubs emerge along with small pine, oak, and hickory trees. These organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach its equilibrium point and resemble the community before the fire. This equilibrium state is referred to as the <b>climax community</b>, which will remain until the next disturbance. The climax community is typically characteristic of a given climate and geology. Although the community in equilibrium looks the same once it is attained, the equilibrium is a dynamic one with constant changes in abundance and sometimes species identities. The return of a natural ecosystem after agricultural activities is also a well-documented secondary succession process.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="190" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_762.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  19.27  <span class="s30">Secondary succession is  seen in an  oak  and  hickory  forest  after  a  forest  fire.

SUMMARY</p><p class="s52">19.1 Population Demographics and Dynamics</p><p>Populations are individuals of a species that live in a particular habitat. Ecologists measure characteristics of populations: size, density, and distribution pattern. Life tables are useful to calculate life expectancies of individual population members. Survivorship curves show the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time.</p><p class="s52">19.2 Population Growth and Regulation</p><p>Populations with unlimited resources grow exponentially—with an accelerating growth rate. When resources become limiting, populations follow a logistic growth curve in which population size will level off at the carrying capacity.<br/>Populations are regulated by a variety of density-dependent and density-independent factors. Life-history characteristics, such as age at first reproduction or numbers of offspring, are characteristics that evolve in populations just as anatomy or behavior can evolve over time. The model of <i>r</i>- and <i>K</i>-selection suggests that characters, and possibly suites of characters, may evolve adaptations to population stability near the carrying capacity (<i>K</i>-selection) or rapid population growth and collapse (<i>r</i>-selection). Species will exhibit adaptations somewhere on a continuum between these two extremes.</p><p class="s52">19.3 The Human Population</p><p>Earth’s human population is growing exponentially. Humans have increased their carrying capacity through technology, urbanization, and harnessing the energy of fossil fuels. The age structure of a population allows us to predict population growth. Unchecked human population growth could have dire long-term effects on human welfare and Earth’s ecosystems.</p><p class="s52">19.4 Community Ecology</p><p>Communities include all the different species living in a given area. The variety of these species is referred to as biodiversity. Many organisms have developed defenses against predation and herbivory, including mechanical defenses, warning coloration, and mimicry. Two species cannot exist indefinitely in the same habitat competing directly for the same resources. Species may form symbiotic relationships such as commensalism, mutualism, or parasitism.

The ecosystem comprises all the biotic components (living things) and abiotic components (non-living things) in a particular geographic area. Some of the abiotic components include air, water, soil, and climate. Ecosystem biologists study how nutrients and energy are stored and moved among organisms and the surrounding atmosphere, soil, and water.<br/>Wild lupine and Karner blue butterflies live in an oak-pine barren habitat in portions of Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New York (<span class="s32">Figure 20.1</span>). This habitat is characterized by natural disturbance in the form of fire and nutrient- poor soils that are low in nitrogen—important factors in the distribution of the plants that live in this habitat. Researchers interested in ecosystem ecology study the importance of limited resources in this ecosystem and the movement of resources (such as nutrients) through the biotic and abiotic portions of the ecosystem. Researchers also examine how organisms have adapted to their ecosystem.</p><p class="s20">530                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="134" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_765.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">20.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Energy  Flow through Ecosystems</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe the basic types of ecosystems on Earth<br/>•   Differentiate between food chains and food webs and recognize the importance of each<br/>•   Describe how organisms acquire energy in a food web and in associated food chains<br/>•   Explain how the efficiency of energy transfers between trophic levels effects ecosystem<br/>An <b>ecosystem </b>is a community of living organisms and their abiotic (non-living) environment. Ecosystems can be small, such as the tide pools found near the rocky shores of many oceans, or large, such as those found in the tropical rainforest of the Amazon in Brazil (<span class="s32">Figure 20.2</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="495" height="235" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_766.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.2  <span class="s30">A (a)  tidal  pool  ecosystem in Matinicus  Island,  Maine,  is  a  small  ecosystem, while  the  (b)  Amazon rainforest in Brazil is a large  ecosystem.

Within these three categories are individual ecosystem types based on the environmental habitat and organisms present.</p><p class="s24">Ecology of Ecosystems</p><p>Life in an ecosystem often involves competition for limited resources, which occurs both within a single species and between different species. Organisms compete for food, water, sunlight, space, and mineral nutrients. These resources provide the energy for metabolic processes and the matter to make up organisms’ physical structures. Other critical factors influencing community dynamics are the components of its physical environment: a habitat’s climate (seasons, sunlight, and rainfall), elevation, and geology. These can all be important environmental variables that determine which organisms can exist within a particular area.<br/>Freshwater ecosystems are the least common, occurring on only 1.8 percent of Earth&#39;s surface. These systems comprise lakes, rivers, streams, and springs; they are quite diverse, and support a variety of animals, plants, fungi, protists and prokaryotes.<br/>Marine ecosystems are the most common, comprising 75 percent of Earth&#39;s surface and consisting of three basic types: shallow ocean, deep ocean water, and deep ocean bottom. Shallow ocean ecosystems include extremely biodiverse coral reef ecosystems, yet the deep ocean water is known for large numbers of plankton and krill (small crustaceans) that support it. These two environments are especially important to aerobic respirators worldwide, as the phytoplankton perform 40 percent of all photosynthesis on Earth. Although not as diverse as the other two, deep ocean bottom ecosystems contain a wide variety of marine organisms. Such ecosystems exist even at depths where light is unable to penetrate through the water.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    531</p><p>Terrestrial ecosystems, also known for their diversity, are grouped into large categories called biomes. A <b>biome </b>is a large- scale community of organisms, primarily defined on land by the dominant plant types that exist in geographic regions of the planet with similar climatic conditions. Examples of biomes include tropical rainforests, savannas, deserts, grasslands, temperate forests, and tundras. Grouping these ecosystems into just a few biome categories obscures the great diversity of the individual ecosystems within them. For example, the saguaro cacti (<i>Carnegiea gigantean</i>) and other plant life in the Sonoran Desert, in the United States, are relatively diverse compared with the desolate rocky desert of Boa Vista, an island off the coast of Western Africa (<span class="s32">Figure 20.3</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="211" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_767.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.3  <span class="s30">Desert ecosystems, like all ecosystems, can  vary  greatly.

They are routinely exposed to various disturbances: changes in the environment that affect their compositions, such as yearly variations in rainfall and temperature. Many disturbances are a result of natural processes. For example, when lightning causes a forest fire and destroys part of a forest ecosystem, the ground is eventually populated with grasses, followed by bushes and shrubs, and later mature trees: thus, the forest is restored to its former state. This process is so universal that ecologists have given it a name—succession. The impact of environmental disturbances caused by human activities is now as significant as the changes wrought by natural processes. Human agricultural practices, air pollution, acid rain, global deforestation, overfishing, oil spills, and illegal dumping on land and into the ocean all have impacts on ecosystems.</p><p class="s27">Equilibrium <span class="p">is a dynamic state of an ecosystem in which, despite changes in species numbers and occurrence, biodiversity remains somewhat constant. In ecology, two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems: resistance and resilience. The ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called </span>resistance<span class="p">. The speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed is called </span>resilience<span class="p">. Ecosystem resistance and resilience are especially important when considering human impact. The nature of an ecosystem may change to such a degree that it can lose its resilience entirely. This process can lead to the complete destruction or irreversible altering of the ecosystem.</span></p><p class="s24">Food  Chains and Food  Webs</p><p>A <b>food chain </b>is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass as one organism eats another; the levels in the food chain are producers, primary consumers, higher-level consumers, and finally decomposers. These levels are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics. There is a single path through a food chain. Each organism in a food chain occupies a specific <b>trophic level </b>(energy level), its position in the food chain or food web.<br/>In  many  ecosystems,  the  base,  or  foundation,  of  the  food  chain  consists  of  photosynthetic  organisms  (plants  or phytoplankton), which are called <b>producers</b>. The organisms that consume the producers are herbivores: the <b>primary consumers</b>. <b>Secondary consumers </b>are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers. <b>Tertiary consumers </b>are carnivores that eat other carnivores. Higher-level consumers feed on the next lower trophic levels, and so on, up to the organisms at the top of the food chain: the <b>apex consumers</b>. In the Lake Ontario food chain, shown in <span class="s32">Figure 20.4</span>, the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain.</p><p class="s20">532                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p><span><IMG width="278" height="544" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_768.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.4 <span class="s30">These are  the trophic levels  of a food chain  in Lake Ontario  at the United States–Canada border.

Energy is lost at each trophic level and between trophic levels as heat and in the transfer to decomposers (<span class="s32">Figure 20.5</span>). Thus, after a limited number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy remaining in the food chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher trophic level.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    533</p><p><span><IMG width="504" height="364" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_769.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.5  <span class="s30">The relative  energy in trophic levels  in a Silver Springs, Florida,  ecosystem is shown.

Even when all organisms are grouped into appropriate trophic levels, some of these organisms can feed on more than one trophic level; likewise, some of these organisms can also be fed on from multiple trophic levels. In addition, species feed on and are eaten by more than one species. In other words, the linear model of ecosystems, the food chain, is a hypothetical, overly simplistic representation of ecosystem structure. A holistic model—which includes all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment—is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems. A <b>food web </b>is a concept that accounts for the multiple trophic (feeding) interactions between each species and the many species it may feed on, or that feed on it. In a food web, the several trophic connections between each species and the other species that interact with it may cross multiple trophic levels. The matter and energy movements of virtually all ecosystems are more accurately described by food webs (<span class="s32">Figure 20.6</span>).</p><p class="s20">534                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p><span><IMG width="421" height="440" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_770.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_771.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.6  <span class="s30">This  food  web  shows the  interactions between organisms across trophic  levels.

A <b>grazing food web </b>has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base, followed by herbivores and various carnivores. A <b>detrital food web </b>consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter (dead organisms), including decomposers (which break down dead and decaying organisms) and detritivores (which consume organic detritus). These organisms are usually bacteria,<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    535</p><p>fungi, and invertebrate animals that recycle organic material back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms. As ecosystems require a method to recycle material from dead organisms, grazing food webs have an associated detrital food web. For example, in a meadow ecosystem, plants may support a grazing food web of different organisms, primary and other levels of consumers, while at the same time supporting a detrital food web of bacteria and fungi feeding off dead plants and animals. Simultaneously, a detrital food web can contribute energy to a grazing food web, as when a robin eats an earthworm.</p><p class="s24">How Organisms Acquire  Energy  in a Food  Web</p><p>All living things require energy in one form or another. Energy is used by most complex metabolic pathways (usually in the form of ATP), especially those responsible for building large molecules from smaller compounds. Living organisms would not be able to assemble macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and complex carbohydrates) from their monomers without a constant energy input.<br/>Food-web diagrams illustrate how energy flows directionally through ecosystems. They can also indicate how efficiently organisms acquire energy, use it, and how much remains for use by other organisms of the food web. Energy is acquired by living things in two ways: autotrophs harness light or chemical energy and heterotrophs acquire energy through the consumption and digestion of other living or previously living organisms.<br/>Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are <b>autotrophs</b>, which are organisms capable of synthesizing their own food (more specifically, capable of using inorganic carbon as a carbon source). Photosynthetic autotrophs ( <b>photoautotrophs</b>) use sunlight as an energy source, and chemosynthetic autotrophs ( <b>chemoautotrophs</b>) use inorganic molecules as an energy source. Autotrophs are critical for most ecosystems: they are the producer trophic level. Without these organisms, energy would not be available to other living organisms, and life itself would not be possible.<br/>Photoautotrophs, such as plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, are the energy source for a majority of the world’s ecosystems. These ecosystems are often described by grazing and detrital food webs. Photoautotrophs harness the Sun’s solar energy by converting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP (and NADP). The energy stored in ATP is used to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose. The rate at which photosynthetic producers incorporate energy from the Sun is called <b>gross primary productivity</b>. However, not all of the energy incorporated by producers is available to the other organisms in the food web because producers must also grow and reproduce, which consumes energy. <b>Net primary productivity </b>is the energy that remains in the producers after accounting for these organisms’ respiration and heat loss. The net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level.<br/>Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria and archaea that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean (<span class="s32">Figure 20.7</span>). Many chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide (H<span class="s54">2</span>S), which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy; this allows them to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose, for their own energy and, in turn, supplies energy to the rest of the ecosystem.</p><p class="s20">536                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p><span><IMG width="400" height="300" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_773.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.7  <span class="s30">Swimming  shrimp,  a few squat lobsters, and  hundreds of vent mussels are  seen at a hydrothermal vent at the bottom  of the ocean.

These are substances that are fat soluble, not water soluble, and are stored in the fat reserves of each organism. Many substances have been shown to biomagnify, including classical studies with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which were described in the 1960s bestseller, <i>Silent Spring </i>by Rachel Carson. DDT was a commonly used pesticide before its dangers to apex consumers, such as the bald eagle, became known. In aquatic ecosystems, organisms from each trophic level consumed many organisms in the lower level, which caused DDT to increase in birds (apex consumers) that ate fish. Thus, the birds accumulated sufficient amounts of DDT to cause fragility in their eggshells. This effect increased egg breakage during nesting and was shown to have devastating effects on these bird populations. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in the 1970s.<br/>Other substances that biomagnify are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), which were used as coolant liquids in the United States until their use was banned in 1979, and heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. These substances are best studied in aquatic ecosystems, where predatory fish species accumulate very high concentrations of toxic substances that are at quite low concentrations in the environment and in producers. As illustrated in a study performed by the NOAA in the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron of the North American Great Lakes (<span class="s32">Figure 20.8</span>), PCB concentrations increased from the producers of the ecosystem (phytoplankton) through the different trophic levels of fish species. The apex consumer, the walleye, has more than four times the amount of PCBs compared to phytoplankton. Also, based on results from other studies, birds that eat these fish may have PCB levels at least one order of magnitude higher than those found in the lake fish.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    537</p><p><span><IMG width="360" height="341" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_774.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.8  <span class="s30">This  chart  shows the  PCB  concentrations found  at  the  various   trophic  levels  in  the  Saginaw  Bay ecosystem of Lake Huron.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends that pregnant women and young children should not consume any swordfish, shark, king mackerel, or tilefish because of their high mercury content. These individuals are advised to eat fish low in mercury: salmon, shrimp, pollock, and catfish. Biomagnification is a good example of how ecosystem dynamics can affect our everyday lives, even influencing the food we eat.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="90" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_775.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">20.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Biogeochemical Cycles</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Discuss the biogeochemical cycles of water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur<br/>•   Explain how human activities have impacted these cycles and the resulting potential consequences for Earth<br/>Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight (or inorganic molecules for chemoautotrophs) and leaving as heat during the transfers between trophic levels. Rather than flowing through an ecosystem, the matter that makes up living organisms is conserved and recycled. The six most common elements associated with organic molecules—carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath Earth’s surface. Geologic processes, such as weathering, erosion, water drainage, and the subduction of the continental plates, all play a role in the cycling of elements on Earth. Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process, the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their nonliving environment is called a <b>biogeochemical cycle</b>.<br/>Water, which contains hydrogen and oxygen, is essential to all living processes. The <b>hydrosphere </b>is the area of Earth where water movement and storage occurs: as liquid water on the surface (rivers, lakes, oceans) and beneath the surface (groundwater) or ice, (polar ice caps and glaciers), and as water vapor in the atmosphere. Carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels. Nitrogen is a major component of our nucleic acids and proteins and is critical to human agriculture. Phosphorus, a major component of nucleic acids, is one of the main ingredients (along with nitrogen) in artificial fertilizers used in agriculture, which has environmental impacts on our surface water. Sulfur, critical to the three-dimensional folding of proteins (as in disulfide binding), is released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels.</p><p class="s20">538                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_776.jpg"/></span><br/>The cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is critical for the leaching of nitrogen and phosphate into rivers, lakes, and oceans. The ocean is also a major reservoir for carbon. Thus, mineral nutrients are cycled, either rapidly or slowly, through the entire biosphere between the biotic and abiotic world and from one living organism to another.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_777.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/biogeochemical" class="s25">Head to this </a>website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/biogeochemical) <span class="p">to learn more about biogeochemical cycles.</span></p><p class="s24">The Water Cycle</p><p>Water is essential for all living processes. The human body is more than one-half water and human cells are more than<br/>70 percent water. Thus, most land animals need a supply of fresh water to survive. Of the stores of water on Earth, 97.5 percent is salt water (<span class="s32">Figure 20.9</span>). Of the remaining water, 99 percent is locked as underground water or ice. Thus, less than one percent of fresh water is present in lakes and rivers. Many living things are dependent on this small amount of surface fresh water supply, a lack of which can have important effects on ecosystem dynamics. Humans, of course, have developed technologies to increase water availability, such as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using desalination to obtain drinkable water from the ocean. Although this pursuit of drinkable water has been ongoing throughout human history, the supply of fresh water continues to be a major issue in modern times.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="196" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_778.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.9  <span class="s30">Only  2.5  percent of water  on  Earth  is  fresh  water,  and  less  than  1  percent of fresh  water  is  easily accessible to living things.</span></p><p>The various processes that occur during the cycling of water are illustrated in <span class="s32">Figure 20.10</span>. The processes include the following:<br/>•   evaporation and sublimation<br/>•   condensation and precipitation<br/>•   subsurface water flow<br/>•   surface runoff and snowmelt<br/>•   streamflow<br/>The water cycle is driven by the Sun’s energy as it warms the oceans and other surface waters. This leads to evaporation (water to water vapor) of liquid surface water and sublimation (ice to water vapor) of frozen water, thus moving large amounts of water into the atmosphere as water vapor. Over time, this water vapor condenses into clouds as liquid or frozen droplets and eventually leads to precipitation (rain or snow), which returns water to Earth’s surface. Rain reaching Earth’s surface may evaporate again, flow over the surface, or percolate into the ground. Most easily observed is surface runoff: the<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    539</p><p>flow of fresh water either from rain or melting ice. Runoff can make its way through streams and lakes to the oceans or flow directly to the oceans themselves.<br/>In most  natural  terrestrial  environments  rain  encounters  vegetation  before  it  reaches  the  soil  surface.  A  significant percentage of water evaporates immediately from the surfaces of plants. What is left reaches the soil and begins to move down. Surface runoff will occur only if the soil becomes saturated with water in a heavy rainfall. Most water in the soil will be taken up by plant roots. The plant will use some of this water for its own metabolism, and some of that will find its way into animals that eat the plants, but much of it will be lost back to the atmosphere through a process known as evapotranspiration. Water enters the vascular system of the plant through the roots and evaporates, or transpires, through the stomata of the leaves. Water in the soil that is not taken up by a plant and that does not evaporate is able to percolate into the subsoil and bedrock. Here it forms groundwater.<br/>Groundwater is a significant reservoir of fresh water. It exists in the pores between particles in sand and gravel, or in the fissures in rocks. Shallow groundwater flows slowly through these pores and fissures and eventually finds its way to a stream or lake where it becomes a part of the surface water again. Streams do not flow because they are replenished from rainwater directly; they flow because there is a constant inflow from groundwater below. Some groundwater is found very deep in the bedrock and can persist there for millennia. Most groundwater reservoirs, or aquifers, are the source of drinking or irrigation water drawn up through wells. In many cases these aquifers are being depleted faster than they are being replenished by water percolating down from above.<br/>Rain and surface runoff are major ways in which minerals, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, are cycled from land to water. The environmental effects of runoff will be discussed later as these cycles are described.<br/><span><IMG width="526" height="366" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_779.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure   20.10   <span class="s30">Water   from  the  land  and  oceans enters the  atmosphere by  evaporation or  sublimation, where   it condenses into clouds  and  falls as rain or snow.

Carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role in the structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms. Carbon compounds contain energy, and many of these compounds from plants and algae have remained stored as fossilized carbon, which humans use as fuel. Since the 1800s, the use of fossil fuels has accelerated. As global demand for Earth’s limited fossil fuel supplies has risen since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased as the fuels are burned. This increase in carbon dioxide has been associated with climate change and is a major environmental concern worldwide.</p><p class="s20">540                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p>The carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected subcycles: one dealing with rapid carbon exchange among living organisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon through geologic processes.

Volcanic activity and,  more  recently,  human emissions bring this stored carbon back  into the carbon cycle. (credit: modification of work by John  M. Evans and Howard  Perlman, USGS)</span></p><p class="s34">The Biological Carbon Cycle</p><p>Living organisms are connected in many ways, even between ecosystems. A good example of this connection is the exchange of carbon between heterotrophs and autotrophs within and between ecosystems by way of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the basic building block that autotrophs use to build multi-carbon, high-energy compounds, such as glucose. The energy harnessed from the Sun is used by these organisms to form the covalent bonds that link carbon atoms together. These chemical bonds store this energy for later use in the process of respiration. Most terrestrial autotrophs obtain their carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, while marine autotrophs acquire it in the dissolved form (carbonic acid, HCO <span class="s54">–</span>). However the carbon dioxide is acquired, a byproduct of fixing carbon in organic compounds is oxygen. Photosynthetic organisms are responsible for maintaining approximately 21 percent of the oxygen content of the atmosphere that we observe today.<br/>The partners in biological carbon exchange are the heterotrophs (especially the primary consumers, largely herbivores). Heterotrophs acquire the high-energy carbon compounds from the autotrophs by consuming them and breaking them down by respiration to obtain cellular energy, such as ATP. The most efficient type of respiration, aerobic respiration, requires oxygen obtained from the atmosphere or dissolved in water. Thus, there is a constant exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the autotrophs (which need the carbon) and the heterotrophs (which need the oxygen). Autotrophs also respire and consume the organic molecules they form: using oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. They release more oxygen gas as a waste product of photosynthesis than they use for their own respiration; therefore, there is excess available for the respiration of other aerobic organisms. Gas exchange through the atmosphere and water is one way that the carbon cycle connects all living organisms on Earth.</p><p class="s34">The Biogeochemical Carbon Cycle</p><p>The movement of carbon through land, water, and air is complex, and, in many cases, it occurs much more slowly geologically than the movement between living organisms. Carbon is stored for long periods in what are known as carbon reservoirs, which include the atmosphere, bodies of liquid water (mostly oceans), ocean sediment, soil, rocks (including fossil fuels), and Earth’s interior.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    541</p><p>As stated, the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide that is essential to the process of photosynthesis. The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans. The exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each, and each one affects the other reciprocally. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="s54">2</span>) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and, unlike oxygen and nitrogen gas, reacts with water molecules to form ionic compounds. Some of these ions combine with calcium ions in the seawater to form calcium carbonate (CaCO<span class="s54">3</span>), a major component of the shells of marine organisms. These organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone, which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth.<br/>On land, carbon is stored in soil as organic carbon as a result of the decomposition of living organisms or from weathering of terrestrial rock and minerals. Deeper under the ground, at land and at sea, are fossil fuels, the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form. Fossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. A <b>non-renewable resource </b>is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land (including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems. Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within Earth by the process of <b>subduction</b>: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another. Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents.<br/>Carbon dioxide is also added to the atmosphere by the animal husbandry practices of humans. The large number of land animals raised to feed Earth’s growing human population results in increased carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere caused by their respiration. This is another example of how human activity indirectly affects biogeochemical cycles in a significant way. Although much of the debate about the future effects of increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on fossils fuels, scientists take natural processes, such as volcanoes, plant growth, soil carbon levels, and respiration, into account as they model and predict the future impact of this increase.</p><p class="s24">The Nitrogen Cycle</p><p>Getting nitrogen into the living world is difficult. Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate nitrogen from the atmosphere (which exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N<span class="s54">2</span>) even though this molecule comprises approximately<br/>78 percent of the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world via free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules through nitrogen fixation (conversion of N<span class="s54">2</span>). Cyanobacteria live in most aquatic ecosystems where sunlight is present; they play a key role in nitrogen fixation. Cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic sources of nitrogen to “fix” nitrogen. <i>Rhizobium </i>bacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, beans, and peanuts) and provide them with the organic nitrogen they need. Free-living bacteria, such as <i>Azotobacter</i>, are also important nitrogen fixers.<br/>Organic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as primary production and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen. As shown in <span class="s32">Figure 20.12</span>, the nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is eventually converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by bacteria. This process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. First, the ammonification process converts nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead animals into<br/>ammonium (NH <span class="s54">+</span><br/>) by certain bacteria and fungi. Second, this ammonium is then converted to nitrites (NO <span class="s54">−</span>) by nitrifying</p><p class="s54">−</p><p>bacteria, such as <i>Nitrosomonas</i>, through nitrification. Subsequently, nitrites are converted to nitrates (NO<span class="s54">3  </span>) by similar<br/>organisms. Lastly, the process of denitrification occurs, whereby bacteria, such as <i>Pseudomonas </i>and <i>Clostridium</i>, convert the nitrates into nitrogen gas, thus allowing it to re-enter the atmosphere.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="603" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_781.png"/></span></p><p class="s20">542                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p class="s29">Figure  20.12  <span class="s30">Nitrogen  enters the living world from the atmosphere through  nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

Nitrogen fixing bacteria convert  nitrogen  gas  (N<span class="s54">2</span>) into organic  compounds.<br/>Human activity can release nitrogen into the environment by two primary means: the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases different nitrogen oxides, and by the use of artificial fertilizers (which contain nitrogen and phosphorus compounds) in agriculture, which are then washed into lakes, streams, and rivers by surface runoff. Atmospheric nitrogen (other than N<span class="s54">2</span>) is associated with several effects on Earth’s ecosystems including the production of acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO<span class="s54">3</span>) and greenhouse gas effects (as nitrous oxide, N<span class="s54">2</span>O), potentially causing climate change. A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater <b>eutrophication</b>, a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the overgrowth of algae and a number of consequential problems.<br/>A similar process occurs in the marine nitrogen cycle, where the ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification processes are performed by marine bacteria and archaea. Some of this nitrogen falls to the ocean floor as sediment, which can then be moved to land in geologic time by uplift of Earth’s surface, and thereby incorporated into terrestrial rock. Although the movement of nitrogen from rock directly into living systems has been traditionally seen as insignificant compared with nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere, a recent study showed that this process may indeed be significant and should be</p><p class="s55">[1]</p><p>included in any study of the global nitrogen cycle.<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_782.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">1.

Phosphate and nitrate runoff from fertilizers also negatively affect several lake and bay ecosystems including the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a><br/><span><IMG width="625" height="895" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_785.png"/></span></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    545</p><p class="s16">Chesapeake Bay</p><p class="s29">Figure 20.15 <span class="s30">This (a) satellite  image  shows the Chesapeake Bay, an ecosystem affected by phosphate and nitrate runoff.

In the  1970s, the  Chesapeake Bay was  one  of the  first aquatic ecosystems to have  identified  dead zones, which continue to kill many  fish and  bottom- dwelling species such  as clams, oysters, and  worms.  Several species have  declined in the  Chesapeake Bay because surface water  runoff contains excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer use  on land. The source of the  fertilizers  (with high nitrogen  and  phosphate content) is not limited to agricultural  practices. There are  many  nearby urban  areas and  more  than  150 rivers and  streams empty  into the bay that are  carrying fertilizer runoff from lawns  and  gardens. Thus,  the decline  of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex  issue and requires the cooperation of industry,  agriculture, and individual homeowners.<br/>Of particular  interest to conservationists is the oyster  population  (<span class="s32">Figure  20.15</span><b>b</b>);  it is estimated that more than 200,000 acres of oyster  reefs  existed in the bay in the 1700s, but that number has  now declined to only<br/>36,000 acres. Oyster  harvesting was  once  a major industry for Chesapeake Bay, but it declined 88 percent between 1982  and  2007.  This decline  was  caused not only by fertilizer runoff  and  dead zones, but also because of overharvesting. Oysters require  a certain  minimum population  density  because they must  be in close  proximity to reproduce. Human  activity has  altered the  oyster  population  and  locations, thus  greatly disrupting  the ecosystem.<br/>The  restoration of the  oyster  population  in the  Chesapeake Bay has  been ongoing  for several years with mixed success. Not only do many  people find oysters good  to eat,  but the  oysters also  clean  up the  bay. They  are  filter feeders, and  as they eat,  they clean  the  water  around them.  Filter feeders eat  by pumping a continuous stream of water  over  finely divided  appendages (gills in the  case of oysters) and  capturing prokaryotes, plankton,  and  fine organic  particles in their mucus. In the 1700s, it was  estimated that it took only a few days  for the oyster  population  to filter the entire volume of the bay. Today, with the changed water conditions, it is estimated that the present population  would take nearly  a year to do the same job.<br/>Restoration  efforts   have   been  ongoing   for  several  years  by  non-profit   organizations  such   as  the<br/>Chesapeake Bay Foundation. The  restoration goal  is to find a way to increase population  density  so  the</p><p class="s20">546                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p>oysters can  reproduce more  efficiently. Many disease-resistant varieties (developed at the Virginia Institute of Marine  Science for the  College  of William and  Mary) are  now  available and  have  been used in the construction of experimental oyster  reefs. Efforts by Virginia and Delaware to clean  and restore the bay have been hampered because much of the pollution entering the bay comes from other states, which emphasizes the need for interstate cooperation to gain successful restoration.<br/>The  new,   hearty   oyster   strains  have   also   spawned a  new  and   economically  viable  industry—oyster aquaculture—which not only supplies oysters for food and profit, but also  has  the added benefit  of cleaning the bay.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="147" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_786.png"/></span></p><p class="s24">The Sulfur Cycle</p><p>Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living things.

Some ecosystems rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source. This sulfur then supports marine ecosystems in the form of sulfates.<br/>Human activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle. The burning of large quantities of fossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere. As rain falls through this gas, it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain, which damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes, thus killing many of the resident plants and animals. <b>Acid rain </b>is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid, which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems. Acid rain also affects the man-made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings. For example, many marble monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, have suffered significant damage from acid rain over the years. These examples show the wide-ranging effects of human activities on our environment and the challenges that remain for our future.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="90" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_789.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">20.3 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Terrestrial Biomes</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Identify the two major abiotic factors that determine the type of terrestrial biome in an area<br/>•   Recognize distinguishing characteristics of each of the eight major terrestrial biomes<br/>Earth’s biomes can be either terrestrial or aquatic. Terrestrial biomes are based on land, while aquatic biomes include both ocean and freshwater biomes. The eight major terrestrial biomes on Earth are each distinguished by characteristic temperatures and amount of precipitation. Annual totals and fluctuations of precipitation affect the kinds of vegetation and animal life that can exist in broad geographical regions. Temperature variation on a daily and seasonal basis is also important for predicting the geographic distribution of a biome. Since a biome is defined by climate, the same biome can occur in geographically distinct areas with similar climates (<span class="s32">Figure 20.18</span>). There are also large areas on Antarctica, Greenland, and in mountain ranges that are covered by permanent glaciers and support very little life. Strictly speaking, these are not considered biomes and in addition to extremes of cold, they are also often deserts with very low precipitation.</p><p class="s20">548                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p><span><IMG width="450" height="210" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_790.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.18  <span class="s30">Each  of the  world’s eight  major  biomes is distinguished by characteristic temperatures and  amount of precipitation.

This biome is found in equatorial regions (<span class="s32">Figure 20.18</span>). Tropical rainforests are the most diverse terrestrial biome. This biodiversity is still largely unknown to science and is under extraordinary threat primarily through logging and deforestation for agriculture. Tropical rainforests have also been described as nature’s pharmacy because of the potential for new drugs that is largely hidden in the chemicals produced by the huge diversity of plants, animals, and other organisms. The vegetation is characterized by plants with spreading roots and broad leaves that fall off throughout the year, unlike the trees of deciduous forests that lose their leaves in one season. These forests are “evergreen,” year-round.<br/>The temperature and sunlight profiles of tropical rainforests are stable in comparison to that of other terrestrial biomes, with average temperatures ranging from 20<span class="s54">o</span>C to 34<span class="s54">o</span>C (68<span class="s54">o</span>F to 93<span class="s54">o</span>F). Month-to-month temperatures are relatively constant in tropical rainforests, in contrast to forests further from the equator. This lack of temperature seasonality leads to year-round plant growth, rather than the seasonal growth seen in other biomes. In contrast to other ecosystems, a more constant daily amount of sunlight (11–12 hours per day) provides more solar radiation, thereby a longer period of time for plant growth.<br/>The annual rainfall in tropical rainforests ranges from 250 cm to more than 450 cm (8.2–14.8 ft) with considerable seasonal variation. Tropical rainforests have wet months in which there can be more than 30 cm (11–12 in) of precipitation, as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10 cm (3.5 in) of rainfall. However, the driest month of a tropical rainforest can still exceed the <i>annual </i>rainfall of some other biomes, such as deserts.<br/>Tropical rainforests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values support rapid plant growth (<span class="s32">Figure 20.19</span>). However, the high rainfall quickly leaches nutrients from the soils of these forests, which are typically low in nutrients. Tropical rainforests are characterized by vertical layering of vegetation and the formation of distinct habitats for animals within each layer. On the forest floor is a sparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter. Above that is an understory of short, shrubby foliage. A layer of trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper <b>canopy</b>—the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves. Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy. These layers provide diverse and complex habitats for the variety of plants, animals, and other organisms within the tropical wet forests. Many species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex structure of the tropical wet forests for food and shelter. Some organisms live several meters above ground rarely ever descending to the forest floor.<br/>Rainforests are not the only forest biome in the tropics; there are also tropical dry forests, which are characterized by a dry season of varying lengths. These forests commonly experience leaf loss during the dry season to one degree or another. The loss of leaves from taller trees during the dry season opens up the canopy and allows sunlight to the forest floor that allows the growth of thick ground-level brush, which is absent in tropical rainforests. Extensive tropical dry forests occur in Africa (including Madagascar), India, southern Mexico, and South America.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    549</p><p><span><IMG width="402" height="301" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_791.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.19  <span class="s30">Species diversity is very high in tropical wet forests, such  as these forests of Madre de Dios, Peru,  near the Amazon  River.

Savannas have an extensive dry season and consequent fires. As a result, scattered in the grasses and forbs (herbaceous flowering plants) that dominate the savanna, there are relatively few trees (<span class="s32">Figure 20.20</span>). Since fire is an important source of disturbance in this biome, plants have evolved well-developed root systems that allow them to quickly re-sprout after a fire.<br/><span><IMG width="400" height="300" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_792.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.20  <span class="s30">Although  savannas are  dominated by grasses, small  woodlands, such  as this  one  in Mount  Archer</span></p><p class="s30">National Park in Queensland, Australia,  may dot the landscape.

Deserts in other regions, such as the Sahara Desert in northern Africa or the Namib Desert in southwestern Africa are dry because of the high-pressure, dry air descending at those latitudes. Subtropical deserts are very dry; evaporation typically exceeds precipitation. Subtropical hot deserts can have daytime soil surface temperatures above 60<span class="s54">o</span>C (140<span class="s54">o</span>F) and nighttime temperatures approaching 0<span class="s54">o</span>C (32<span class="s54">o</span>F). The temperature drops so far because there is little water vapor in the air to prevent radiative cooling of the land surface. Subtropical deserts are characterized by low annual precipitation of fewer than 30 cm (12 in) with little monthly variation and lack of predictability in rainfall. Some years may receive tiny amounts of rainfall, while others receive more. In some cases, the annual rainfall can be as low as 2 cm (0.8 in) in subtropical deserts located in central Australia (“the Outback”) and northern Africa.<br/>The low species diversity of this biome is closely related to its low and unpredictable precipitation. Despite the relatively low diversity, desert species exhibit fascinating adaptations to the harshness of their environment. Very dry deserts lack perennial vegetation that lives from one year to the next; instead, many plants are annuals that grow quickly and reproduce when rainfall does occur, then they die. Perennial plants in deserts are characterized by adaptations that conserve water: deep roots, reduced foliage, and water-storing stems (<span class="s32">Figure 20.21</span>). Seed plants in the desert produce seeds that can lie dormant for extended periods between rains. Most animal life in subtropical deserts has adapted to a nocturnal life, spending the hot daytime hours beneath the ground. The Namib Desert is the oldest on the planet, and has probably been dry for more than 55 million years. It supports a number of endemic species (species found only there) because of this great age. For example, the unusual gymnosperm <i>Welwitschia mirabilis </i>is the only extant species of an entire order of plants. There are also five species of reptiles considered endemic to the Namib.<br/>In addition to subtropical deserts there are cold deserts that experience freezing temperatures during the winter and any precipitation is in the form of snowfall. The largest of these deserts are the Gobi Desert in northern China and southern Mongolia, the Taklimakan Desert in western China, the Turkestan Desert, and the Great Basin Desert of the United States.<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="188" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_793.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 20.21 <span class="s30">Many desert plants  have  tiny leaves or no leaves at all to reduce water loss.

The annual rainfall in this biome ranges from 65 cm to 75 cm (25.6–29.5 in) and the majority of the rain falls in the winter. Summers are very dry and many chaparral plants are dormant during the summertime. The chaparral vegetation is dominated by shrubs and is adapted to periodic fires, with some plants producing seeds that germinate only after a hot fire. The ashes left behind after a fire are rich in nutrients like nitrogen that fertilize the soil and promote plant regrowth. Fire is a natural part of the maintenance of this biome and frequently threatens human habitation in this biome in the U.S. (<span class="s32">Figure 20.22</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    551</p><p><span><IMG width="400" height="300" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_794.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 20.22  <span class="s30">The chaparral is dominated by shrubs.

Temperate grasslands have pronounced annual fluctuations in temperature with hot summers and cold winters. The annual temperature variation produces specific growing seasons for plants. Plant growth is possible when temperatures are warm enough to sustain plant growth, which occurs in the spring, summer, and fall.<br/>Annual precipitation ranges from 25.4 cm to 88.9 cm (10–35 in). Temperate grasslands have few trees except for those found growing along rivers or streams. The dominant vegetation tends to consist of grasses. The treeless condition is maintained by low precipitation, frequent fires, and grazing (<span class="s32">Figure 20.23</span>). The vegetation is very dense and the soils are fertile because the subsurface of the soil is packed with the roots and rhizomes (underground stems) of these grasses. The roots and rhizomes act to anchor plants into the ground and replenish the organic material (humus) in the soil when they die and decay.<br/><span><IMG width="400" height="261" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_795.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  20.23  </span>The  American  bison  (<i>Bison  bison</i>),  more  commonly  called  the  buffalo, is a grazing  mammal that  once populated American  prairies  in huge  numbers.

Temperatures range between –30<span class="s54">o</span>C and<br/>30<span class="s54">o</span>C (–22<span class="s54">o</span>F to 86<span class="s54">o</span>F) and drop to below freezing on an annual basis. These temperatures mean that temperate forests have defined growing seasons during the spring, summer, and early fall. Precipitation is relatively constant throughout the year and ranges between 75 cm and 150 cm (29.5–59 in).<br/>Deciduous trees are the dominant plant in this biome with fewer evergreen conifers. Deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and remain leafless in the winter. Thus, little photosynthesis occurs during the dormant winter period. Each spring, new leaves appear as temperature increases. Because of the dormant period, the net primary productivity of temperate forests is less than that of tropical rainforests. In addition, temperate forests show far less diversity of tree species than tropical rainforest biomes.<br/>The trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground; however, more sunlight reaches the ground in this biome than in tropical rainforests because trees in temperate forests do not grow as tall as the trees in tropical rainforests. The soils of the temperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients compared to tropical rainforests. This is because of the thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors and reduced leaching of nutrients by rainfall. As this leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned to the soil. The leaf litter also protects soil from erosion, insulates the ground, and provides habitats for invertebrates and their predators (<span class="s32">Figure 20.24</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="424" height="318" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_796.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 20.24  <span class="s30">Deciduous trees are the dominant plant in the temperate forest.

Boreal forests are also found above a certain elevation (and below high elevations where trees cannot grow) in mountain ranges throughout the Northern Hemisphere. This biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. The annual precipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm (15.7–39 in) and usually takes the form of snow; little evaporation occurs because of the cold temperatures.<br/>The long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the predominance of cold-tolerant cone-bearing plants. These are evergreen coniferous trees like pines, spruce, and fir, which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round. Evergreen trees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees because less energy from the Sun is required to warm a needle-like leaf than a broad leaf. Evergreen trees grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest. In addition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen. Leaves are a nitrogen-rich structure and deciduous<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    553</p><p>trees must produce a new set of these nitrogen-rich structures each year. Therefore, coniferous trees that retain nitrogen-rich needles in a nitrogen limiting environment may have had a competitive advantage over the broad-leafed deciduous trees.<br/>The net primary productivity of boreal forests is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical wet forests. The aboveground biomass of boreal forests is high because these slow-growing tree species are long-lived and accumulate standing biomass over time. Species diversity is less than that seen in temperate forests and tropical rainforests. Boreal forests lack the layered forest structure seen in tropical rainforests or, to a lesser degree, temperate forests. The structure of a boreal forest is often only a tree layer and a ground layer. When conifer needles are dropped, they decompose more slowly than broad leaves; therefore, fewer nutrients are returned to the soil to fuel plant growth (<span class="s32">Figure 20.25</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="400" height="264" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_797.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 20.25  <span class="s30">The boreal  forest (taiga) has  low lying plants  and conifer trees.

Tundra also exists at elevations above the tree line on mountains. The average winter temperature is –34°C (–29.2°F) and the average summer temperature is 3°C–12°C (37°F –52°F). Plants in the Arctic tundra have a short growing season of approximately 50–60 days. However, during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid. The annual precipitation of the Arctic tundra is low (15–25 cm or 6–10 in) with little annual variation in precipitation. And, as in the boreal forests, there is little evaporation because of the cold temperatures.<br/>Plants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground and include low shrubs, grasses, lichens, and small flowering plants (<span class="s32">Figure 20.26</span>). There is little species diversity, low net primary productivity, and low aboveground biomass. The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as <b>permafrost</b>. The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate far into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter, which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter. The melting of the permafrost in the brief summer provides water for a burst of productivity while temperatures and long days permit it. During the growing season, the ground of the Arctic tundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens.</p><p class="s20">554                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p><span><IMG width="402" height="270" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_798.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_799.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 20.26 <span class="s30">Low-growing plants  such  as shrub  willow dominate the tundra  landscape during the summer, shown  here in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

In the case of aquatic biomes the abiotic factors include light, temperature, flow regime, and dissolved solids. The aquatic medium—water— has different physical and chemical properties than air. Even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly clear (there are no suspended particles), water, on its own, absorbs light. As one descends deep enough into a body of water, eventually there will be a depth at which the sunlight cannot reach. While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a terrestrial ecosystem that shade light (like fog, dust, or insect swarms), these are not usually permanent features of the environment. The importance of light in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both freshwater and marine ecosystems because it controls productivity through photosynthesis.<br/>In addition to light, solar radiation warms bodies of water and many exhibit distinct layers of water at differing temperatures. The water temperature affects the organisms’ rates of growth and the amount of dissolved oxygen available for respiration.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    555</p><p>The movement of water is also important in many aquatic biomes. In rivers, the organisms must obviously be adapted to the constant movement of the water around them, but even in larger bodies of water such as the oceans, regular currents and tides impact availability of nutrients, food resources, and the presence of the water itself.<br/>Finally, all natural water contains dissolved solids, or salts. Fresh water contains low levels of such dissolved substances because the water is rapidly recycled through evaporation and precipitation. The oceans have a relatively constant high salt content. Aquatic habitats at the interface of marine and freshwater ecosystems have complex and variable salt environments that range between freshwater and marine levels. These are known as brackish water environments. Lakes located in closed drainage basins concentrate salt in their waters and can have extremely high salt content that only a few and highly specialized species are able to inhabit.</p><p class="s24">Marine Biomes</p><p>The ocean is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform in chemical composition. It is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter. Within the ocean, coral reefs are a second type of marine biome. Estuaries, coastal areas where salt water and fresh water mix, form a third unique marine biome.<br/>The ocean is categorized by several zones (<span class="s32">Figure 20.28</span>). All of the ocean’s open water is referred to as the <b>pelagic realm </b>(or zone). The <b>benthic realm </b>(or zone) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor. From the surface to the bottom or the limit to which photosynthesis occurs is the <b>photic zone </b>(approximately 200 m or 650 ft). At depths greater than 200 m, light cannot penetrate; thus, this is referred to as the <b>aphotic zone</b>. The majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis. The deepest part of the ocean, the Challenger Deep (in the Mariana Trench, located in the western Pacific Ocean), is about 11,000 m (about 6.8 mi) deep. To give some perspective on the depth of this trench, the ocean is, on average, 4267 m or 14,000 ft deep.</p><p class="s34">Ocean</p><p>The physical diversity of the ocean has a significant influence on the diversity of organisms that live within it. The ocean is categorized into different zones based on how far light reaches into the water. Each zone has a distinct group of species adapted to the biotic and abiotic conditions particular to that zone.<br/>The <b>intertidal zone </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 20.28</span>) is the oceanic region that is closest to land. With each tidal cycle, the intertidal zone alternates between being inundated with water and left high and dry. Generally, most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach. In some cases, the intertidal zone is indeed a sandy beach, but it can also be rocky, muddy, or dense with tangled roots in mangrove forests. The intertidal zone is an extremely variable environment because of tides. Organisms may be exposed to air at low tide and are underwater during high tide. Therefore, living things that thrive in the intertidal zone are often adapted to being dry for long periods of time. The shore of the intertidal zone is also repeatedly struck by waves and the organisms found there are adapted to withstand damage from the pounding action of the waves (<span class="s32">Figure 20.27</span>). The exoskeletons of shoreline crustaceans (such as the shore crab, <i>Carcinus maenas</i>) are tough and protect them from desiccation (drying out) and wave damage. Another consequence of the pounding waves is that few algae and plants establish themselves in constantly moving sand or mud.</p><p class="s20">556                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p><span><IMG width="450" height="309" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_802.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 20.27 <span class="s30">Sea stars, sea urchins,  and mussel shells  are often found in the intertidal zone,  shown  here  in Kachemak</span></p><p class="s30">Bay, Alaska.  (credit: NOAA)</p><p>The <b>neritic zone </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 20.28</span>) extends from the margin of the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m (or 650 ft) at the edge of the continental shelf. When the water is relatively clear, photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone. The water contains silt and is well-oxygenated, low in pressure, and stable in temperature. These factors all contribute to the neritic zone having the highest productivity and biodiversity of the ocean. Phytoplankton, including photosynthetic bacteria and larger species of algae, are responsible for the bulk of this primary productivity. Zooplankton, protists, small fishes, and shrimp feed on the producers and are the primary food source for most of the world’s fisheries. The majority of these fisheries exist within the neritic zone.<br/>Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the <b>oceanic zone </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 20.28</span>). Within the oceanic zone there is thermal stratification. Abundant phytoplankton and zooplankton support populations of fish and whales. Nutrients are scarce and this is a relatively less productive part of the marine biome. When photosynthetic organisms and the organisms that feed on them die, their bodies fall to the bottom of the ocean where they remain; the open ocean lacks a process for bringing the organic nutrients back up to the surface.<br/>Beneath the pelagic zone is the benthic realm, the deepwater region beyond the continental shelf (<span class="s32">Figure 20.28</span>). The bottom of the benthic realm is comprised of sand, silt, and dead organisms. Temperature decreases as water depth increases. This is a nutrient-rich portion of the ocean because of the dead organisms that fall from the upper layers of the ocean. Because of this high level of nutrients, a diversity of fungi, sponges, sea anemones, marine worms, sea stars, fishes, and bacteria exists.<br/>The deepest part of the ocean is the <b>abyssal zone</b>, which is at depths of 4000 m or greater. The abyssal zone (<span class="s32">Figure 20.28</span>) is very cold and has very high pressure, high oxygen content, and low nutrient content. There are a variety of invertebrates and fishes found in this zone, but the abyssal zone does not have photosynthetic organisms. Chemosynthetic bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide and other minerals emitted from deep hydrothermal vents. These chemosynthetic bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide as an energy source and serve as the base of the food chain found around the vents.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    557</p><p class="s29">Figure  20.28  <span class="s30">The  ocean is divided into different  zones based on water  depth,  distance from the  shoreline, and light penetration.</span></p><p>In which of the following regions would you expect to find photosynthetic organisms?<br/>a.

They are found within 30˚ north and south of the equator. The Great Barrier Reef is a well-known reef system located several miles off the northeastern coast of Australia. Other coral reefs are fringing islands, which are directly adjacent to land, or atolls, which are circular reefs surrounding a former island that is now underwater. The coral-forming colonies of organisms (members of phylum Cnidaria) secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. These calcium-rich skeletons slowly accumulate, thus forming the underwater reef (<span class="s32">Figure 20.29</span>). Corals found in shallower waters (at a depth of approximately<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_804.jpg"/></span><br/>60 m or about 200 ft) have a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic unicellular protists. The relationship provides corals with the majority of the nutrition and the energy they require. The waters in which these corals live are nutritionally poor and, without this mutualism, it would not be possible for large corals to grow because there are few planktonic organisms for them to feed on. Some corals living in deeper and colder water do not have a mutualistic relationship with protists; these corals must obtain their energy exclusively by feeding on plankton using stinging cells on their tentacles.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_805.png"/></span><br/><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/coral_organisms" class="s25">In   this   National   Oceanic   and   Atmospheric   Administration   (NOAA)   </a><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/coral_organisms" class="s36">video   (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/</a></p><p class="s32">coral_organisms) <span class="p">, marine ecologist Dr. Peter Etnoyer discusses his research on coral organisms.</span></p><p class="s20">558                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p>Coral reefs are one of the most diverse biomes.

The animals that create coral reefs  do so over thousands of years, continuing  to slowly deposit the calcium  carbonate that  forms  their characteristic ocean homes. Bathed in warm tropical waters, the coral animals and  their symbiotic  protist partners evolved  to survive  at the upper limit of ocean water temperature.<br/>Together, climate change and human activity pose dual threats to the long-term  survival of the world’s coral reefs. The main cause of killing of coral reefs  is warmer-than-usual surface water.  As global warming raises ocean temperatures, coral reefs  are  suffering.  The excessive warmth  causes the coral organisms to expel their endosymbiotic, food-producing protists,  resulting  in a phenomenon known as bleaching. The colors  of corals  are  a result  of the particular  protist endosymbiont, and  when  the protists  leave, the corals  lose  their color and turn white, hence the term “bleaching.”<br/>Rising  levels  of atmospheric carbon dioxide  further  threaten the  corals  in other  ways;  as carbon dioxide dissolves in ocean waters, it lowers pH, thus increasing ocean acidity. As acidity increases, it interferes with the calcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes.<br/>When  a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose  food and  shelter. Coral reefs are  also  economically important  tourist destinations, so the decline  of coral reefs  poses a serious threat  to coastal economies.<br/>Human  population  growth has  damaged corals  in other  ways,  too. As human coastal populations increase, the  runoff of sediment and  agricultural  chemicals has  increased, causing some of the  once-clear tropical waters to become cloudy.  At the  same time,  overfishing  of popular  fish species has  allowed  the  predator species that eat corals  to go unchecked.<br/>Although  a  rise  in global  temperatures of 1°C–2°C  (a  conservative scientific  projection)  in the  coming decades may  not  seem large,  it is very  significant  to this  biome.  When  change occurs rapidly,  species can  become extinct  before  evolution  leads to newly adapted species. Many scientists believe  that  global warming, with its rapid (in terms  of evolutionary time) and inexorable increases in temperature, is tipping the balance beyond the point at which many of the world’s coral reefs  can recover.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="504" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_807.png"/></span></p><p class="s24">Estuaries: Where the Ocean Meets  Fresh  Water</p><p><b>Estuaries </b>are biomes that occur where a river, a source of fresh water, meets the ocean. Therefore, both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity; mixing results in a diluted (brackish) salt water. Estuaries form protected areas where many of the offspring of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish begin their lives. Salinity is an important factor that influences the organisms and the adaptations of the organisms found in estuaries. The salinity of estuaries varies and is based on the rate of flow of its freshwater sources. Once or twice a day, high tides bring salt water into the estuary. Low tides occurring at the same frequency reverse the current of salt water (<span class="s32">Figure 20.30</span>).</p><p class="s20">560                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p><span><IMG width="352" height="235" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_808.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 20.30 <span class="s30">As estuary is where  fresh water and salt water meet, such  as the mouth of the Klamath River in California, shown  here.  (credit: U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers)</span></p><p>The daily mixing of fresh water and salt water is a physiological challenge for the plants and animals that inhabit estuaries. Many estuarine plant species are halophytes, plants that can tolerate salty conditions. Halophytic plants are adapted to deal with salt water spray and salt water on their roots. In some halophytes, filters in the roots remove the salt from the water that the plant absorbs. Animals, such as mussels and clams (phylum Mollusca), have developed behavioral adaptations that expend a lot of energy to function in this rapidly changing environment. When these animals are exposed to low salinity, they stop feeding, close their shells, and switch from aerobic respiration (in which they use gills) to anaerobic respiration (a process that does not require oxygen). When high tide returns to the estuary, the salinity and oxygen content of the water increases, and these animals open their shells, begin feeding, and return to aerobic respiration.</p><p class="s24">Freshwater Biomes</p><p>Freshwater biomes include lakes, ponds, and wetlands (standing water) as well as rivers and streams (flowing water). Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water, crop irrigation, sanitation, recreation, and industry. These various roles and human benefits are referred to as <b>ecosystem services</b>. Lakes and ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are therefore connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these terrestrial biomes.</p><p class="s34">Lakes and Ponds</p><p>Lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. During the summer in temperate regions, thermal stratification of deep lakes occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the Sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. The process produces a sharp transition between the warm water above and cold water beneath. The two layers do not mix until cooling temperatures and winds break down the stratification and the water in the lake mixes from top to bottom. During the period of stratification, most of the productivity occurs in the warm, well-illuminated, upper layer, while dead organisms slowly rain down into the cold, dark layer below where decomposing bacteria and cold-adapted species such as lake trout exist. Like the ocean, lakes and ponds have a photic layer in which photosynthesis can occur. Phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and provide the base of the food web of lakes and ponds. Zooplankton, such as rotifers and small crustaceans, consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms that sink to the bottom.<br/>Nitrogen and particularly phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Therefore, they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus (e.g., from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an <b>algal bloom</b>. Algal blooms (<span class="s32">Figure 20.31</span>) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water. As a result, the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. When the algae die and decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to die.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    561</p><p><span><IMG width="250" height="333" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_809.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 20.31  <span class="s30">The uncontrolled growth of algae in this waterway has  resulted in an algal bloom.</span></p><p class="s34">Rivers and Streams</p><p>Rivers and the narrower streams that feed into the rivers are continuously moving bodies of water that carry water from the source or headwater to the mouth at a lake or ocean.

Streams begin at a point of origin referred to as <b>source water</b>. The source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and clear. The <b>channel </b>(the width of the river or stream) is narrower here than at any other place along the length of the river or stream. Headwater streams are of necessity at a higher elevation than the mouth of the river and often originate in regions with steep grades leading to higher flow rates than lower elevation stretches of the river.<br/>Faster-moving water and the short distance from its origin results in minimal silt levels in headwater streams; therefore, the water is clear. Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks; the swift current inhibits the growth of phytoplankton. Photosynthesis may be further reduced by tree cover reaching over the narrow stream. This shading also keeps temperatures lower. An additional input of energy can come from leaves or other organic material that falls into a river or stream from the trees and other plants that border the water. When the leaves decompose, the organic material and nutrients in the leaves are returned to the water. The leaves also support a food chain of invertebrates that eat them and are in turn eaten by predatory invertebrates and fish. Plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving water. For instance, leeches (phylum Annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on both ends. These suckers attach to the substrate, keeping the leech anchored in place. In temperate regions, freshwater trout species (phylum Chordata) may be an important predator in these fast-moving and colder river and streams.</p><p class="s20">562                                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere</p><p>As the river or stream flows away from the source, the width of the channel gradually widens, the current slows, and the temperature characteristically increases. The increasing width results from the increased volume of water from more and more tributaries. Gradients are typically lower farther along the river, which accounts for the slowing flow. With increasing volume can come increased silt, and as the flow rate slows, the silt may settle, thus increasing the deposition of sediment. Phytoplankton can also be suspended in slow-moving water. Therefore, the water will not be as clear as it is near the source. The water is also warmer as a result of longer exposure to sunlight and the absence of tree cover over wider expanses between banks. Worms (phylum Annelida) and insects (phylum Arthropoda) can be found burrowing into the mud. Predatory vertebrates (phylum Chordata) include waterfowl, frogs, and fishes. In heavily silt-laden rivers, these predators must find food in the murky waters, and, unlike the trout in the clear waters at the source, these vertebrates cannot use vision as their primary sense to find food. Instead, they are more likely to use taste or chemical cues to find prey.<br/>When a river reaches the ocean or a large lake, the water typically slows dramatically and any silt in the river water will settle. Rivers with high silt content discharging into oceans with minimal currents and wave action will build deltas, low- elevation areas of sand and mud, as the silt settles onto the ocean bottom. Rivers with low silt content or in areas where ocean currents or wave action are high create estuarine areas where the fresh water and salt water mix.</p><p class="s24">Wetlands</p><p><b>Wetlands </b>are environments in which the soil is either permanently or periodically saturated with water. Wetlands are different from lakes and ponds because wetlands exhibit a near continuous cover of emergent vegetation. <b>Emergent vegetation </b>consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves, stems, and flowers extending above the water’s surface. There are several types of wetlands including marshes, swamps, bogs, mudflats, and salt marshes (<span class="s32">Figure 20.33</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="449" height="300" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_811.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  20.33  <span class="s30">Located in southern Florida,  Everglades National  Park  is vast  array  of wetland  environments, including sawgrass marshes, cypress swamps, and estuarine mangrove forests.

Bogs develop in depressions where water flow is low or nonexistent. Bogs usually occur in areas where there is a clay bottom with poor percolation. Percolation is the movement of water through the pores in the soil or rocks. The water found in a bog is stagnant and oxygen depleted because the oxygen that is used during the decomposition of organic matter is not replaced. As the oxygen in the water is depleted, decomposition slows. This leads to organic acids and other acids building up and lowering the pH of the water. At a lower pH, nitrogen becomes unavailable to plants. This creates a challenge for plants because nitrogen is an important limiting resource. Some types of bog plants (such as sundews, pitcher plants, and Venus flytraps) capture insects and extract the nitrogen from their bodies. Bogs have low net primary productivity because the water found in bogs has low levels of nitrogen and oxygen.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 20 | Ecosystems and the Biosphere                                                                                                                                                                    563</p><p class="s24">KEY TERMS</p><p class="s27">abyssal zone <span class="p">the deepest part of the ocean at depths of 4000 m or greater</span></p><p class="s27">acid rain  <span class="p">a corrosive rain caused by rainwater mixing with sulfur dioxide gas as it fall through the atmosphere, turning it into weak sulfuric acid, causing damage to aquatic ecosystems</span></p><p class="s27">algal bloom <span class="p">a rapid increase of algae in an aquatic system</span></p><p class="s27">apex  consumer <span class="p">an organism at the top of the food chain</span></p><p class="s27">aphotic zone <span class="p">the part of the ocean where photosynthesis cannot occur</span></p><p class="s27">arctic tundra  <span class="p">a biome characterized by low average temperatures, brief growing seasons, the presence of permafrost, and limited precipitation largely in the form of snow in which the dominant vegetation are low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants</span></p><p class="s27">autotroph <span class="p">an organism capable of synthesizing its own food molecules from smaller inorganic molecules</span></p><p class="s27">benthic realm  <span class="p">(also, benthic zone) the part of the ocean that extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor</span></p><p class="s27">biogeochemical cycle <span class="p">the cycling of minerals and nutrients through the biotic and abiotic world</span></p><p class="s27">biomagnification <span class="p">an increasing concentration of persistent, toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level, from the producers to the apex consumers</span></p><p class="s27">biome <span class="p">a large-scale community of organisms, primarily defined on land by the dominant plant types that  exist in geographic regions of the planet with similar climatic conditions</span></p><p class="s27">boreal  forest <span class="p">a biome found in temperate and subarctic regions characterized by short growing seasons and dominated structurally by coniferous trees</span></p><p class="s27">canopy <span class="p">the branches and foliage of trees that form a layer of overhead coverage in a forest</span></p><p class="s27">channel <span class="p">the bed and banks of a river or stream</span></p><p class="s27">chaparral   <span class="p">a biome found in temperate coastal regions characterized by low trees and dry-adapted shrubs and forbs</span></p><p class="s27">chemoautotroph <span class="p">an organism capable of synthesizing its own food using energy from inorganic molecules</span></p><p class="s27">coral reef  <span class="p">an ocean ridge formed by marine invertebrates living in warm shallow waters within the photic zone</span></p><p class="s27">cryptofauna <span class="p">the invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of coral reefs</span></p><p class="s27">dead  zone <span class="p">an area in a lake and ocean near the mouths of rivers where large areas are depleted of their normal flora and fauna;

Organisms in an ecosystem acquire energy in a variety of ways, which is transferred between trophic levels as the energy flows from the base to the top of the food web, with energy being lost at each transfer. There is energy lost at each trophic level, so the lengths of food chains are limited because there is a point where not enough energy remains to support a population of consumers. Fat soluble compounds biomagnify up a food chain causing damage to top consumers. even when environmental concentrations of a toxin are low.</p><p class="s52">20.2 Biogeochemical Cycles</p><p>Mineral nutrients are cycled through ecosystems and their environment. Of particular importance are water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. All of these cycles have major impacts on ecosystem structure and function. As human activities have caused major disturbances to these cycles, their study and modeling is especially important. Ecosystems have been damaged by a variety of human activities that alter the natural biogeochemical cycles due to pollution, oil spills, and events causing global climate change. The health of the biosphere depends on understanding these cycles and how to protect the environment from irreversible damage.</p><p class="s52">20.3 Terrestrial Biomes</p><p>Earth has terrestrial and aquatic biomes. Aquatic biomes include both freshwater and marine environments. There are eight major terrestrial biomes: tropical rainforests, savannas, subtropical deserts, chaparral, temperate grasslands, temperate forests, boreal forests, and Arctic tundra. The same biome can occur in different geographic locations with similar<br/>climates. Temperature and precipitation, and variations in both, are key abiotic factors that shape the composition of animal and plant communities in terrestrial biomes. Some biomes, such as temperate grasslands and temperate forests, have distinct seasons with cold and hot weather alternating throughout the year. In warm, moist biomes, such as the tropical rainforest, net primary productivity is high as warm temperatures, abundant water, and a year-round growing season fuel plant growth. Other biomes, such as deserts and tundra, have low primary productivity due to extreme temperatures and a shortage of water.</p><p class="s52">20.4 Aquatic  and Marine Biomes</p><p>Aquatic biomes include both saltwater and freshwater biomes. The abiotic factors important for the structuring of aquatic biomes can be different than those seen in terrestrial biomes. Sunlight is an important factor in bodies of water, especially those that are very deep, because of the role of photosynthesis in sustaining certain organisms. Other important factors include temperature, water movement, and salt content. Oceans may be thought of as consisting of different zones based on water depth, distance from the shoreline, and light penetrance. Different kinds of organisms are adapted to the conditions found in each zone. Coral reefs are unique marine ecosystems that are home to a wide variety of species. Estuaries are found where rivers meet the ocean; their shallow waters provide nourishment and shelter for young crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, and many other species. Freshwater biomes include lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and wetlands. Bogs are an interesting type of wetland characterized by standing water, a lower pH, and a lack of nitrogen.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 20.12 </span><span class="p">Which of the following statements about the nitrogen cycle is false?</span></p><p>a.

Biologists call the previous rate the “background” rate of extinction. The current high rates will cause a precipitous decline in the biodiversity (the diversity of species) of the planet in the next century or two. The losses will include many species we know today. Although it is sometimes difficult to predict which species will become extinct, many are listed as endangered (at great risk of extinction). However, the majority of extinctions will be of species that science has not yet even described.<br/>Most of these “invisible” species that will become extinct currently live in tropical rainforests like those of the Amazon basin. These rainforests are the most diverse ecosystems on the planet and are being destroyed rapidly by deforestation, which biologists believe is driving many rare species with limited distributions extinct.

Rates are higher in other tropical rainforests. What we are likely to notice on a day-to-day basis as a result of biodiversity loss is that food will be more difficult to produce, clean water will be more difficult to find, and the rate of development of new medicines will become slower, as we depend upon other species for much of these services. This increased loss of biodiversity is almost entirely a result of human activities as we destroy species’ habitats, introduce disruptive species into ecosystems, hunt some species to extinction, continue to warm the planet with greenhouse gases, and influence nature in other ways. Slowing the loss of biodiversity is within our abilities if we make dramatic changes in our consumptive behavior and identify and protect the elements of our ecosystems that we depend on for our lives and welfare.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="91" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_814.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">21.1 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Importance of Biodiversity</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Describe biodiversity as the equilibrium of naturally fluctuating rates of extinction and speciation<br/>•   Identify benefits of biodiversity to humans<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="240" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_815.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.2 <span class="s30">This tropical lowland rainforest in Madagascar is an example of a high biodiversity habitat.

Traditionally, ecologists have measured <b>biodiversity </b>by taking into account both the number of species and the number of individuals in each of those species. However, biologists are using measures of biodiversity at several levels of biological organization (including genes, populations, and ecosystems) to help focus efforts to preserve the biologically and technologically important elements of biodiversity.<br/>When biodiversity loss through extinction is thought of as the loss of the passenger pigeon, the dodo, or, even, the woolly mammoth there seems to be no reason to care about it because these events happened long ago. How is the loss practically important for the welfare of the human species? Would these species have made our lives any better? From the perspective of evolution and ecology, the loss of a particular individual species, with some exceptions, may seem unimportant, but the current accelerated extinction rate means the loss of tens of thousands of species within our lifetimes. Much of this loss is occurring in tropical rainforests like the one pictured in <span class="s32">Figure 21.2</span>, which are especially high-diversity ecosystems that are being cleared for timber and agriculture. This is likely to have dramatic effects on human welfare through the collapse of ecosystems and in added costs to maintain food production, clean air and water, and improve human health.<br/>Biologists recognize that human populations are embedded in ecosystems and are dependent on them, just as is every other species on the planet. Agriculture began after early hunter-gatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate environment: the ecosystem in which they existed. This cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on living things other than crops and domesticated animals on the planet. Today our technology smoothes out the extremes of existence and allows many of us to live longer, more comfortable lives, but ultimately the human species cannot exist without its surrounding ecosystems. Our ecosystems provide our food. This includes living plants that grow in soil ecosystems and the animals that eat these plants (or other animals) as well as<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity                                                                                                                                                                                         569</p><p>photosynthetic organisms in the oceans and the other organisms that eat them. Our ecosystems have provided and will provide many of the medications that maintain our health, which are commonly made from compounds found in living organisms. Ecosystems provide our clean water, which is held in lake and river ecosystems or passes through terrestrial ecosystems on its way into groundwater.</p><p class="s24">Types of Biodiversity</p><p>A common meaning of biodiversity is simply the number of species in a location or on Earth; for example, the American Ornithologists’ Union lists 2078 species of birds in North and Central America. This is one measure of the bird biodiversity on the continent. More sophisticated measures of diversity take into account the relative abundances of species. For example, a forest with 10 equally common species of trees is more diverse than a forest that has 10 species of trees wherein just one of those species makes up 95 percent of the trees rather than them being equally distributed. Biologists have also identified alternate measures of biodiversity, some of which are important in planning how to preserve biodiversity.</p><p class="s34">Genetic and Chemical Biodiversity</p><p>Genetic diversity is one alternate concept of biodiversity. <b>Genetic diversity </b>(or variation) is the raw material for adaptation in a species. A species’ future potential for adaptation depends on the genetic diversity held in the genomes of the individuals in populations that make up the species. The same is true for higher taxonomic categories. A genus with very different types of species will have more genetic diversity than a genus with species that look alike and have similar ecologies. The genus with the greatest potential for subsequent evolution is the most genetically diverse one.<br/>Most genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing. Genetic diversity can also be conceived of as <b>chemical diversity </b>in that species with different genetic makeups produce different assortments of chemicals in their cells (proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism). This chemical diversity is important for humans because of the potential uses for these chemicals, such as medications. For example, the drug eptifibatide is derived from rattlesnake venom and is used to prevent heart attacks in individuals with certain heart conditions.<br/>At present, it is far cheaper to discover compounds made by an organism than to imagine them and then synthesize them in a laboratory. Chemical diversity is one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare. Through selective breeding, humans have domesticated animals, plants, and fungi, but even this diversity is suffering losses because of market forces and increasing globalism in human agriculture and migration. For example, international seed companies produce only a very few varieties of a given crop and provide incentives around the world for farmers to buy these few varieties while abandoning their traditional varieties, which are far more diverse. The human population depends on crop diversity directly as a stable food source and its decline is troubling to biologists and agricultural scientists.</p><p class="s34">Ecosystems Diversity</p><p>It is also useful to define <b>ecosystem diversity</b>: the number of different ecosystems on Earth or in a geographical area. Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems. The loss of an ecosystem means the loss of the interactions between species, the loss of unique features of coadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. An example of a largely extinct ecosystem in North America is the prairie ecosystem (<span class="s32">Figure 21.3</span>). Prairies once spanned central North America from the boreal forest in northern Canada down into Mexico. They are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl. Many of the species survive, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating our most productive agricultural soils is now gone. As a consequence, their soils are now being depleted unless they are maintained artificially at greater expense. The decline in soil productivity occurs because the interactions in the original ecosystem have been lost; this was a far more important loss than the relatively few species that were driven extinct when the prairie ecosystem was destroyed.</p><p class="s20">570                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity</p><p><span><IMG width="503" height="163" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_816.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.3  <span class="s30">The  variety  of ecosystems on Earth—from  coral  reef  to prairie—enables a great  diversity  of species to exist.

A recent estimate suggests that the eukaryote species for which science has names, about 1.5 million species, account for less than 20 percent of the total number of eukaryote species present on the planet (8.7 million species, by one estimate). Estimates of numbers of prokaryotic species are largely guesses, but biologists agree that science has only just begun to catalog their diversity. Even with what is known, there is no centralized repository of names or samples of the described species; therefore, there is no way to be sure that the 1.5 million descriptions is an accurate number. It is a best guess based on the opinions of experts on different taxonomic groups. Given that Earth is losing species at an accelerating pace, science knows little about what is being lost. <span class="s32">Table 21.1 </span>presents recent estimates of biodiversity in different groups.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="89" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_817.png"/></span></p><p class="s60">Estimated Numbers of Described and Predicted species</p><p class="s52">Source: Mora et al 2011</p><p class="s52">Source: Chapman  2009</p><p class="s52">Source: Groombridge and</p><p class="s52">Jenkins 2002</p><p>Animals</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s19">Fungi</p></td><td><p class="s19">44,368</p></td><td><p class="s19">616,320</p></td><td><p class="s19">98,998</p></td><td><p class="s19">1,500,000</p></td><td><p class="s19">72,000</p></td><td><p class="s19">1,500,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s19">Plants</p></td><td><p class="s19">224,244</p></td><td><p class="s19">314,600</p></td><td><p class="s19">310,129</p></td><td><p class="s19">390,800</p></td><td><p class="s19">270,000</p></td><td><p class="s19">320,000</p></td></tr></table><p><span><IMG width="625" height="47" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_818.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="2" height="24" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_819.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="2" height="24" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_820.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="2" height="24" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_821.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="2" height="24" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_822.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="2" height="24" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_823.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="2" height="24" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_824.png"/></span><br/>Prokaryotes                —                —                  10,307       1,000,000    10,175                   —</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s19">Total</p></td><td><p class="s19">1,438,769</p></td><td><p class="s19">10,960,000</p></td><td><p class="s19">1,897,502</p></td><td><p class="s19">10,897,630</p></td><td><p class="s19">1,657,675</p></td><td><p class="s19">13,240,000</p></td></tr></table><p class="s17">Table 21.1 This table shows the estimated number  of species by taxonomic group—including both described (named and studied) and predicted (yet to be named) species.</p><p>There are various initiatives to catalog described species in accessible and more organized ways, and the internet is facilitating that effort.

Without a name and description, a species cannot be studied in depth and in a coordinated way by multiple scientists.</p><p class="s24">Patterns of Biodiversity</p><p>Biodiversity is not evenly distributed on the planet. Lake Victoria contained almost 500 species of cichlids (only one family of fishes present in the lake) before the introduction of an exotic species in the 1980s and 1990s caused a mass extinction. All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria, which is to say they were endemic. <b>Endemic species </b>are found in only one location. For example, the blue jay is endemic to North America, while the Barton Springs salamander is endemic to the mouth of one spring in Austin, Texas. Endemics with highly restricted distributions, like the Barton Springs salamander, are particularly vulnerable to extinction. Higher taxonomic levels, such as genera and families, can also be endemic.<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="252" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_826.png"/></span><br/>Lake Huron contains about 79 species of fish, all of which are found in many other lakes in North America. What accounts for the difference in diversity between Lake Victoria and Lake Huron? Lake Victoria is a tropical lake, while Lake Huron is a temperate lake. Lake Huron in its present form is only about 7,000 years old, while Lake Victoria in its present form is about 15,000 years old. These two factors, latitude and age, are two of several hypotheses biogeographers have suggested to explain biodiversity patterns on Earth.</p><p class="s16">Biogeography</p><p>Biogeography is the study  of the distribution of the world’s species both in the past  and  in the present. The work of biogeographers is critical to understanding our physical  environment, how the environment affects species, and how changes in environment impact the distribution of a species.<br/>There  are three  main fields of study under  the heading of biogeography: ecological biogeography, historical biogeography  (called   paleobiogeography),  and   conservation  biogeography.  Ecological   biogeography studies the  current  factors  affecting  the  distribution  of plants  and  animals. Historical  biogeography, as the name implies,  studies the  past  distribution  of species. Conservation biogeography, on the  other  hand, is focused on the protection and restoration of species based upon the known historical and current  ecological information.  Each  of these fields considers both zoogeography and  phytogeography—the past  and  present distribution of animals and plants.<br/>One of the oldest observed patterns in ecology is that biodiversity in almost every taxonomic group of organism increases as latitude declines. In other words, biodiversity increases closer to the equator (<span class="s32">Figure 21.4</span>).</p><p class="s20">572                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity</p><p><span><IMG width="480" height="278" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_827.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 21.4 <span class="s30">This map illustrates the number of amphibian species across the globe and shows the trend toward higher biodiversity at lower latitudes. A similar pattern is observed for most taxonomic groups.</span></p><p>It is not yet clear why biodiversity increases closer to the equator, but hypotheses include the greater age of the ecosystems in the tropics versus temperate regions, which were largely devoid of life or drastically impoverished during the last ice age. The greater age provides more time for speciation. Another possible explanation is the greater energy the tropics receive from the sun versus the lesser energy input in temperate and polar regions. But scientists have not been able to explain how greater energy input could translate into more species. The complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation by increasing the <b>habitat heterogeneity</b>, or number of ecological niches, in the tropics relative to higher latitudes. The greater heterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution, specialization, and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population differentiation. However, this hypothesis suffers from some circularity—ecosystems with more species encourage speciation, but how did they get more species to begin with? The tropics have been perceived as being more stable than temperate regions, which have a pronounced climate and day-length seasonality. The tropics have their own forms of seasonality, such as rainfall, but they are generally assumed to be more stable environments and this stability might promote speciation.<br/>Regardless of the mechanisms, it is certainly true that biodiversity is greatest in the tropics. The number of endemic species is higher in the tropics. The tropics also contain more biodiversity hotspots. At the same time, our knowledge of the species living in the tropics is lowest and because of recent, heavy human activity the potential for biodiversity loss is greatest.</p><p class="s24">Importance of Biodiversity</p><p>Loss of biodiversity eventually threatens other species we do not impact directly because of their interconnectedness; as species disappear from an ecosystem other species are threatened by the changes in available resources. Biodiversity is important to the survival and welfare of human populations because it has impacts on our health and our ability to feed ourselves through agriculture and harvesting populations of wild animals.</p><p class="s34">Human Health</p><p>Many medications are derived from natural chemicals made by a diverse group of organisms. For example, many plants produce <b>secondary plant compounds</b>, which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them. Some of these secondary plant compounds also work as human medicines. Contemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area. For centuries in Europe, older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals—books that identified the plants and their uses. Humans are not the only animals to use plants for medicinal reasons. The other great apes, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have all been observed self-medicating with plants.<br/>Modern  pharmaceutical  science  also  recognizes  the  importance  of  these  plant  compounds.  Examples  of  significant medicines derived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine (<span class="s32">Figure 21.5</span>). Many medications were once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized. It is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of modern drugs contained at least one plant extract. That number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are replaced by synthetic versions of the plant compounds. Antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health and lifespans in developed countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity                                                                                                                                                                                         573</p><p><span><IMG width="278" height="208" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_828.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.5 <span class="s35">Catharanthus roseus</span><span class="s30">, the Madagascar periwinkle, has  various  medicinal  properties.

(credit: Forest and Kim Starr)</span></p><p>In recent years, animal venoms and poisons have excited intense research for their medicinal potential. By 2007, the FDA had approved five drugs based on animal toxins to treat diseases such as hypertension, chronic pain, and diabetes. Another five drugs are undergoing clinical trials and at least six drugs are being used in other countries. Other toxins under investigation come from mammals, snakes, lizards, various amphibians, fish, snails, octopuses, and scorpions.<br/>Aside from representing billions of dollars in profits, these medications improve people’s lives. Pharmaceutical companies are  actively  looking  for  new  natural  compounds  that  can  function  as  medicines.  It  is  estimated  that  one  third  of pharmaceutical research and development is spent on natural compounds and that about 35 percent of new drugs brought to market between 1981 and 2002 were from natural compounds.<br/>Finally, it has been argued that humans benefit psychologically from living in a biodiverse world. The chief proponent of this idea is entomologist E. O. Wilson. He argues that human evolutionary history has adapted us to living in a natural environment and that built environments generate stresses that affect human health and well-being. There is considerable research into the psychologically regenerative benefits of natural landscapes that suggest the hypothesis may hold some truth.</p><p class="s34">Agricultural</p><p>Since the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding and selecting crop varieties. This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of humans. For example, potatoes were domesticated beginning around 7,000 years ago in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia. The people in this region traditionally lived in relatively isolated settlements separated by mountains. The potatoes grown in that region belong to seven species and the number of varieties likely is in the thousands. Each variety has been bred to thrive at particular elevations and soil and climate conditions. The diversity is driven by the diverse demands of the dramatic elevation changes, the limited movement of people, and the demands created by crop rotation for different varieties that will do well in different fields.<br/>Potatoes are only one example of agricultural diversity. Every plant, animal, and fungus that has been cultivated by humans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising from the demands for food value, adaptation to growing conditions, and resistance to pests. The potato demonstrates a well-known example of the risks of low crop diversity: during the tragic Irish potato famine (1845–1852 AD), the single potato variety grown in Ireland became susceptible to a potato blight—wiping out the crop. The loss of the crop led to famine, death, and mass emigration. Resistance to disease is a chief benefit to maintaining crop biodiversity and lack of diversity in contemporary crop species carries similar risks. Seed companies, which are the source of most crop varieties in developed countries, must continually breed new varieties to keep up with evolving pest organisms. These same seed companies, however, have participated in the decline of the number of varieties available as they focus on selling fewer varieties in more areas of the world replacing traditional local varieties.<br/>The ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the availability of wild forms related to the crop plant. These wild forms are often the source of new gene variants that can be bred with existing varieties to create varieties with new attributes. Loss of wild species related to a crop will mean the loss of potential in crop improvement. Maintaining the genetic diversity of wild species related to domesticated species ensures our continued supply of food.<br/>Since the 1920s, government agriculture departments have maintained seed banks of crop varieties as a way to maintain crop diversity. This system has flaws because over time seed varieties are lost through accidents and there is no way to replace them. In 2008, the Svalbard Global seed Vault, located on Spitsbergen island, Norway, (<span class="s32">Figure 21.6</span>) began storing</p><p class="s20">574                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity</p><p>seeds from around the world as a backup system to the regional seed banks. If a regional seed bank stores varieties in Svalbard, losses can be replaced from Svalbard should something happen to the regional seeds. The Svalbard seed vault is deep into the rock of the arctic island. Conditions within the vault are maintained at ideal temperature and humidity for seed survival, but the deep underground location of the vault in the arctic means that failure of the vault’s systems will not compromise the climatic conditions inside the vault.</p><p class="s29">Figure  21.6  <span class="s30">The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a storage facility for seeds of Earth’s diverse crops.

Why might an arctic climate be good for seed storage?<br/><span><IMG width="625" height="358" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_829.png"/></span><br/>Although crops are largely under our control, our ability to grow them is dependent on the biodiversity of the ecosystems in which they are grown. That biodiversity creates the conditions under which crops are able to grow through what are known as ecosystem services—valuable conditions or processes that are carried out by an ecosystem. Crops are not grown, for the most part, in built environments. They are grown in soil. Although some agricultural soils are rendered sterile using controversial pesticide treatments, most contain a huge diversity of organisms that maintain nutrient cycles—breaking down organic matter into nutrient compounds that crops need for growth. These organisms also maintain soil texture that affects water and oxygen dynamics in the soil that are necessary for plant growth. Replacing the work of these organisms in forming arable soil is not practically possible. These kinds of processes are called ecosystem services. They occur within ecosystems, such as soil ecosystems, as a result of the diverse metabolic activities of the organisms living there, but they provide benefits to human food production, drinking water availability, and breathable air.<br/>Other key ecosystem services related to food production are plant pollination and crop pest control. It is estimated that honeybee pollination within the United States brings in $1.6 billion per year; other pollinators contribute up to $6.7 billion. Over 150 crops in the United States require pollination to produce. Many honeybee populations are managed by beekeepers who rent out their hives’ services to farmers. Honeybee populations in North America have been suffering large losses caused by a syndrome known as colony collapse disorder, a new phenomenon with an unclear cause. Other pollinators include a diverse array of other bee species and various insects and birds. Loss of these species would make growing crops requiring pollination impossible, increasing dependence on other crops.<br/>Finally, humans compete for their food with crop pests, most of which are insects. Pesticides control these competitors, but these are costly and lose their effectiveness over time as pest populations adapt. They also lead to collateral damage by killing non-pest species as well as beneficial insects like honeybees, and risking the health of agricultural workers and consumers. Moreover, these pesticides may migrate from the fields where they are applied and do damage to other ecosystems like streams, lakes, and even the ocean. Ecologists believe that the bulk of the work in removing pests is actually done by predators and parasites of those pests, but the impact has not been well studied. A review found that in 74 percent of studies that looked for an effect of landscape complexity (forests and fallow fields near to crop fields) on natural enemies of pests, the greater the complexity, the greater the effect of pest-suppressing organisms. Another experimental study found that introducing multiple enemies of pea aphids (an important alfalfa pest) increased the yield of alfalfa significantly. This study shows that a diversity of pests is more effective at control than one single pest.

The world’s growing human population faces significant challenges in the increasing costs and other difficulties associated with producing food.</p><p class="s34">Wild Food  Sources</p><p>In addition to growing crops and raising food animals, humans obtain food resources from wild populations, primarily wild fish populations. For about one billion people, aquatic resources provide the main source of animal protein. But since 1990, production from global fisheries has declined. Despite considerable effort, few fisheries on Earth are managed sustainability.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_830.jpg"/></span><br/>Fishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested species, but rather to a radical restructuring of the marine ecosystem in which a dominant species is so over-harvested that it becomes a minor player, ecologically. In addition to humans losing the food source, these alterations affect many other species in ways that are difficult or impossible to predict. The collapse of fisheries has dramatic and long-lasting effects on local human populations that work in the fishery. In addition, the loss of an inexpensive protein source to populations that cannot afford to replace it will increase the cost of living and limit societies in other ways. In general, the fish taken from fisheries have shifted to smaller species and the larger species are overfished. The ultimate outcome could clearly be the loss of aquatic systems as food sources.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_831.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/decliningfish2" class="s25">Visit this </a>website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/decliningfish2) <span class="p">to view a brief video discussing a study of declining fisheries.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="625" height="112" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_832.png"/></span></p><p class="s23">21.2 <span style=" color: #000;">| </span>Threats  to Biodiversity</p><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:<br/>•   Identify significant threats to biodiversity<br/>•   Explain the effects of habitat loss, exotic species, and hunting on biodiversity<br/>•   Identify the early and predicted effects of climate change on biodiversity<br/>The core threat to biodiversity on the planet, and therefore a threat to human welfare, is the combination of human population growth and the resources used by that population. The human population requires resources to survive and grow, and those resources are being removed unsustainably from the environment. The three greatest proximate threats to biodiversity are habitat loss, overharvesting, and introduction of exotic species. The first two of these are a direct result of human population growth and resource use. The third results from increased mobility and trade. A fourth major cause of extinction, anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change, has not yet had a large impact, but it is predicted to become significant during this century. Global climate change is also a consequence of human population needs for energy and the use of fossil fuels to meet those needs (<span class="s32">Figure 21.7</span>). Environmental issues, such as toxic pollution, have specific targeted effects on species, but are not generally seen as threats at the magnitude of the others.</p><p class="s20">576                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity</p><p><span><IMG width="449" height="324" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_833.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.7  <span class="s30">Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels  fluctuate  in a cyclical manner. However,  the  burning  of fossil fuels in recent history has  caused a dramatic increase in the levels  of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere, which have now reached levels  never  before  seen on Earth.  Scientists predict  that  the  addition  of this “greenhouse gas”  to the atmosphere is resulting  in climate change that will significantly impact biodiversity in the coming century.</span></p><p class="s24">Habitat Loss</p><p>Humans rely on technology to modify their environment and replace certain functions that were once performed by the natural ecosystem. Other species cannot do this. Elimination of their habitat—whether it is a forest, coral reef, grassland, or flowing river—will kill the individuals in the species. Remove the entire habitat within the range of a species and, unless they are one of the few species that do well in human-built environments, the species will become extinct. Human destruction of habitats (habitats generally refer to the part of the ecosystem required by a particular species) accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century. Consider the exceptional biodiversity of Sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of critically endangered elephant, and the Sumatran tiger, but half of Sumatra’s forest is now gone. The neighboring island of Borneo, home to the other species of orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest. Forest loss continues in protected areas of Borneo. The orangutan in Borneo is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it is simply the most visible of thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests of Borneo. The forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations (<span class="s32">Figure 21.8</span>). Palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics, and biodiesel in Europe. A 5-year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years from 2000 to 2005 was 3.1 percent. Much loss (2.4 percent) occurred in the humid tropics where forest loss is primarily from timber extraction. These losses certainly also represent the extinction of species unique to those areas.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity                                                                                                                                                                                         577</p><p><span><IMG width="320" height="240" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_834.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="625" height="380" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_835.png"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.8 <span class="s30">An oil palm plantation in Sabah province  Borneo,  Malaysia,  replaces native  forest habitat  that a variety of species depended on to live.

Yet the market  for illegally harvested tropical timber is huge, and  the wood products often find themselves in building supply  stores in the United States. One  estimate is that 10 percent of the imported  timber stream in the United States, which is the world’s largest consumer of wood products, is potentially  illegally logged.  In 2006,  this amounted to $3.6 billion in wood products. Most of the illegal products are  imported  from countries that  act  as intermediaries and  are  not the  originators of the wood.<br/>How is it possible to determine if  a  wood  product,  such  as flooring, was  harvested sustainably or even legally?  The  Forest Stewardship Council  (FSC)  certifies  sustainably harvested forest  products; therefore, looking  for  their  certification  on  flooring  and  other  hardwood products  is  one  way  to  ensure that  the wood  has  not  been taken  illegally from a  tropical  forest.  Certification  applies to specific  products, not  to a producer; some producers’ products may not have  certification  while other  products are  certified.  There are  certifications other  than  the FSC,  but these are  run by timber companies creating a conflict of interest. Another approach is to buy domestic wood species. While it would be great  if there  was a list of legal versus illegal woods,  it is not that simple.  Logging and  forest management laws vary from country  to country; what is illegal in one  country  may  be  legal  in another. Where  and  how a product  is harvested and  whether the forest  from which it comes is being  sustainably maintained all factor  into whether a wood  product  will be certified by the FSC.  It is always  a good  idea  to ask questions about  where  a wood product  came from and how the supplier  knows that it was harvested legally.<br/>Habitat destruction can affect ecosystems other than forests. Rivers and streams are important ecosystems and are frequently the target of habitat modification through building and from damming or water removal. Damming of rivers affects flows and access to all parts of a river. Altering a flow regime can reduce or eliminate populations that are adapted to seasonal changes in flow. For example, an estimated 91 percent of river lengths in the United States have been modified with damming or bank modifications. Many fish species in the United States, especially rare species or species with restricted distributions, have seen declines caused by river damming and habitat loss. Research has confirmed that species of amphibians that must carry out parts of their life cycles in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats are at greater risk of population declines and extinction because of the increased likelihood that one of their habitats or access between them will be lost. This is of particular concern because amphibians have been declining in numbers and going extinct more rapidly than many other groups for a variety of possible reasons.</p><p class="s24">Overharvesting</p><p>Overharvesting is a serious threat to many species, but particularly to aquatic species. There are many examples of regulated fisheries (including hunting of marine mammals and harvesting of crustaceans and other species) monitored by fisheries</p><p class="s20">578                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity</p><p><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_836.jpg"/></span><br/>scientists that have nevertheless collapsed. The western Atlantic cod fishery is the most spectacular recent collapse. While it was a hugely productive fishery for 400 years, the introduction of modern factory trawlers in the 1980s and the pressure on the fishery led to it becoming unsustainable. The causes of fishery collapse are both economic and political in nature. Most fisheries are managed as a common resource, available to anyone willing to fish, even when the fishing territory lies within a country’s territorial waters. Common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the <b>tragedy of the commons</b>, in which fishers have little motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when they do not own the fishery. The general outcome of harvests of resources held in common is their overexploitation. While large fisheries are regulated to attempt to avoid this pressure, it still exists in the background. This overexploitation is exacerbated when access to the fishery is open and unregulated and when technology gives fishers the ability to overfish. In a few fisheries, the biological growth of the resource is less than the potential growth of the profits made from fishing if that time and money were invested elsewhere. In these cases—whales are an example—economic forces will drive toward fishing the population to extinction.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_837.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/habitat_map2" class="s25">Explore a U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service </a>interactive map (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/habitat_map2) <span class="p">of critical habitat for endangered and threatened species in the United States.

But there are some instances in which true extinction is a possibility. Whales have slow-growing populations and are at risk of complete extinction through hunting. Also, there are some species of sharks with restricted distributions that are at risk of extinction. The groupers are another population of generally slow-growing fishes that, in the Caribbean, includes a number of species that are at risk of extinction from overfishing.<br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_838.jpg"/></span><br/>Coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems that face peril from several processes. Reefs are home to 1/3 of the world’s marine fish species—about 4000 species—despite making up only one percent of marine habitat. Most home marine aquaria house coral reef species that are wild-caught organisms—not cultured organisms. Although no marine species is known to have been driven extinct by the pet trade, there are studies showing that populations of some species have declined in response to harvesting, indicating that the harvest is not sustainable at those levels. There are also concerns about the effect of the pet trade on some terrestrial species such as turtles, amphibians, birds, plants, and even the orangutans.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_839.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ocean_matters2" class="s25">View  a  </a>brief  video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ocean_matters2)  <span class="p">discussing  the  role  of  marine  ecosystems  in supporting human welfare and the decline of ocean ecosystems.</span></p><p class="s27">Bush meat <span class="p">is the generic term used for wild animals killed for food.

Some species, however, have characteristics that can make them especially successful in a new ecosystem. These exotic species often undergo dramatic population increases in their new habitat and reset the ecological conditions in the new environment, threatening the species that exist there. When this happens, the exotic species also becomes an invasive species. Invasive species can threaten other species through competition for resources, predation, or disease.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_841.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/exotic_invasiv2" class="s25">Explore this </a>interactive global database (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/exotic_invasiv2) <span class="p">of exotic or invasive species.

The accidental introduction of the brown tree snake via aircraft (<span class="s32">Figure 21.9</span>) from the Solomon Islands to Guam in 1950 has led to the extinction of three species of birds and three to five species of reptiles endemic to the island. Several other species are still threatened. The brown tree snake is adept at exploiting human transportation as a means to migrate; one was even found on an aircraft arriving in Corpus Christi, Texas. Constant vigilance on the part of airport, military, and commercial aircraft personnel is required to prevent the snake from moving from Guam to other islands in the Pacific, especially Hawaii. Islands do not make up a large area of land on the globe, but they do contain a disproportionate number of endemic species because of their isolation from mainland ancestors.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="249" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_842.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure 21.9 </span>The brown tree snake, <i>Boiga irregularis</i>, is an exotic species that has  caused numerous extinctions on the island of Guam  since  its accidental introduction  in 1950.

The zebra mussel was introduced to the Great Lakes from Europe prior to 1988 in ship ballast. The zebra mussels in the Great Lakes have cost the industry millions of dollars in clean up costs to maintain water intakes and other facilities. The mussels have also altered the ecology of the lakes dramatically. They threaten native mollusk populations, but have also benefited some species, such as smallmouth bass. The mussels are filter feeders and have dramatically improved water clarity, which in turn has allowed aquatic plants to grow along shorelines, providing shelter for young fish where it did not exist before. The European green crab, <i>Carcinus maenas</i>, was introduced to San Francisco Bay in the late 1990s, likely in ship ballast water, and has spread north along the coast to Washington. The crabs have been found to dramatically reduce the abundance of native clams and crabs with resulting increases in the prey of native crabs.<br/>Invading exotic species can also be disease organisms. It now appears that the global decline in amphibian species recognized in the 1990s is, in some part, caused by the fungus <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>, which causes the disease <b>chytridiomycosis </b>(<span class="s32">Figure 21.10</span>). There is evidence that the fungus is native to Africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport of a commonly used laboratory and pet species: the African clawed frog, <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. It may well be that biologists themselves are responsible for spreading this disease worldwide. The North American bullfrog, <i>Rana catesbeiana</i>, which has also been widely introduced as a food animal but which easily escapes captivity, survives most infections of <i>B. dendrobatidis </i>and can act as a reservoir for the disease.<br/><span><IMG width="250" height="284" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_843.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure 21.10  </span>This Limosa harlequin frog (<i>Atelopus limosus</i>), an endangered species from Panama, died from a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis.

Anthropogenic warming of the planet has been observed and is hypothesized to continue due to past and continuing emission of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere caused by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These gases decrease the degree to which Earth is able to radiate heat energy created by the sunlight that enters the atmosphere. The changes in climate and energy balance caused by increasing greenhouse gases are complex and our understanding of them depends on predictions generated from detailed computer models. Scientists generally agree the present warming trend is caused by humans and some of the likely effects include dramatic and dangerous climate changes in the coming decades. However, there is still debate and a lack of understanding about specific outcomes. Scientists disagree about the likely magnitude of the effects on extinction rates, with estimates ranging from 15 to 40 percent of species committed to extinction by 2050. Scientists do agree that climate change will alter regional climates, including rainfall and snowfall patterns, making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them. The warming trend will shift colder climates toward the north and south poles, forcing species to move with their adapted climate norms, but also to face habitat gaps along the way. The shifting ranges will impose new competitive regimes on species as they find themselves in contact with other species not present in their historic range. One such unexpected species contact is between polar bears and grizzly bears. Previously, these two species had separate ranges. Now, their ranges are overlapping and there are documented cases of these two species mating and producing viable offspring. Changing climates also throw off the delicate timing adaptations that species have to seasonal food resources and breeding times. Scientists have already documented many contemporary mismatches to shifts in resource availability and timing.<br/>Range shifts are already being observed: for example, on average, European bird species ranges have moved 91 km (56.5 mi) northward. The same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the populations are not moving quickly enough. Range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects, freshwater fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals.<br/>Climate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat for those species adapted to the highest elevations. Some climates will completely disappear. The rate of warming appears to be accelerated in the arctic, which is recognized as a serious threat to polar bear populations that require sea ice to hunt seals during the winter months: seals are the only source of protein available to polar bears. A trend to decreasing sea ice coverage has occurred since observations began in the mid-twentieth century. The rate of decline observed in recent years is far greater than previously predicted by climate models (<span class="s32">Figure 21.12</span>).</p><p class="s20">582                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity</p><p><span><IMG width="526" height="208" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_845.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.12  <span class="s30">The effect of global warming  can  be seen in the continuing  retreat of Grinnell Glacier.

When speciation rates begin to outstrip extinction rates, the number of species will increase; likewise, the reverse is true when extinction rates begin to overtake speciation rates. Throughout the history of life on Earth, as reflected in the fossil record, these two processes have fluctuated to a greater or lesser extent, sometimes leading to dramatic changes in the number of species on the planet as reflected in the fossil record (<span class="s32">Figure 21.13</span>).<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity                                                                                                                                                                                         583</p><p><span><IMG width="424" height="261" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_847.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 21.13  <span class="s30">Extinction intensity as reflected in the fossil record  has  fluctuated throughout Earth’s history. Sudden and dramatic losses of biodiversity, called mass extinctions, have  occurred five times.</span></p><p>Paleontologists have identified five strata in the fossil record that appear to show sudden and dramatic (greater than half of all extant species disappearing from the fossil record) losses in biodiversity. These are called mass extinctions. There are many lesser, yet still dramatic, extinction events, but the five mass extinctions have attracted the most research into their causes. An argument can be made that the five mass extinctions are only the five most extreme events in a continuous series of large extinction events throughout the fossil record (since 542 million years ago). In most cases, the hypothesized causes are still controversial; in one, the most recent, the cause seems clear. The most recent extinction in geological time, about<br/>65 million years ago, saw the disappearance of the dinosaurs and many other species. Most scientists now agree the cause of this extinction was the impact of a large asteroid in the present-day Yucatán Peninsula and the subsequent energy release and global climate changes caused by dust ejected into the atmosphere.</p><p class="s24">Recent and Current Extinction Rates</p><p>A sixth, or Holocene, mass extinction has mostly to do with the activities of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. There are numerous recent extinctions of individual species that are recorded in human writings. Most of these are coincident with the expansion of the European colonies since the 1500s.<br/>One of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird. The dodo bird lived in the forests of Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean. The dodo bird became extinct around 1662. It was hunted for its meat by sailors and was easy prey because the dodo, which did not evolve with humans, would approach people without fear. Introduced pigs, rats, and dogs brought to the island by European ships also killed dodo young and eggs (<span class="s32">Figure 21.14</span>).<br/><span><IMG width="250" height="236" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_848.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.14  <span class="s30">The  dodo  bird was  hunted to  extinction  around 1662.

Steller’s sea cow was discovered by Europeans in 1741, and it was hunted for meat and oil. A total of 27 years elapsed between the sea cow’s first contact with Europeans and extinction of the species. The last Steller’s sea cow was killed in 1768. In another example, the last living passenger pigeon died in a zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914. This species had once migrated in the millions but declined in numbers because of overhunting and loss of habitat through the clearing of forests for farmland.<br/>These are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the past 500 years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) keeps a list of extinct and endangered species called the Red List. The list is not complete, but it describes 380 vertebrates that became extinct after 1500 AD, 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting or overfishing.</p><p class="s24">Estimates of Present-day Extinction Rates</p><p>Estimates of <b>extinction rates </b>are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without being observed. The extinction of a bird or mammal is often noticed by humans, especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way. But there are many organisms that are less noticeable to humans (not necessarily of less value) and many that are undescribed.<br/>The background extinction rate is estimated to be about 1 per million species years (E/MSY). One “species year” is one species in existence for one year. One million species years could be one species persisting for one million years, or a million species persisting for one year. If it is the latter, then one extinction per million species years would be one of those million species becoming extinct in that year. For example, if there are 10 million species in existence, then we would expect 10 of those species to become extinct in a year. This is the background rate.<br/>One contemporary extinction-rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year 1500. For birds alone, this method yields an estimate of 26 E/MSY, almost three times the background rate. However, this value may be underestimated for three reasons. First, many existing species would not have been described until much later in the time period and so their loss would have gone unnoticed. Second, we know the number is higher than the written record suggests because now extinct species are being described from skeletal remains that were never mentioned in written history. And third, some species are probably already extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such. Taking these factors into account raises the estimated extinction rate to nearer 100 E/MSY. The predicted rate by the end of the century is 1500 E/MSY.<br/>A second approach to estimating present-time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss, and it is based on measuring forest-area loss and understanding species–area relationships. The <b>species-area relationship </b>is the rate at which new species are seen when the area surveyed is increased (<span class="s32">Figure 21.15</span>). Likewise, if the habitat area is reduced, the number of species seen will also decline. This kind of relationship is also seen in the relationship between an island’s area and the number of species present on the island: as one increases, so does the other, though not in a straight line. Estimates of extinction rates based on habitat loss and species–area relationships have suggested that with about 90 percent of habitat loss an expected 50 percent of species would become extinct. <span class="s32">Figure 21.15 </span>shows that reducing forest area from 100 km<span class="s54">2 </span>to 10 km<span class="s54">2</span>, a decline of 90 percent, reduces the number of species by about 50 percent. Species–area estimates have led to estimates of present-day species extinction rates of about 1000 E/MSY and higher. In general, actual observations do not show this amount of loss and one explanation put forward is that there is a delay in extinction. According to this explanation, it takes some time for species to fully suffer the effects of habitat loss and they linger on for some time after their habitat is destroyed, but eventually they will become extinct. Recent work has also called into question the applicability of the species-area relationship when estimating the loss of species. This work argues that the species–area relationship leads to an overestimate of extinction rates. Using an alternate method would bring estimates down to around 500 E/MSY in the coming century. Note that this value is still 500 times the background rate.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity                                                                                                                                                                                         585</p><p><span><IMG width="415" height="258" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_849.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="120" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_850.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s30"><span class="s29">Figure  21.15  </span>A typical species-area curve  shows the cumulative number of species found as more  and  more  area is sampled.

In the United States, the first national park with land set aside to remain in a wilderness state was Yellowstone Park in 1890. However, attempts to preserve nature for various reasons have occurred for centuries. Today, the main efforts to preserve biodiversity involve legislative approaches to regulate human and corporate behavior, setting aside protected areas, and habitat restoration.</p><p class="s34">Changing Human Behavior</p><p>Legislation has been enacted to protect species throughout the world. The legislation includes international treaties as well as national and state laws. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) treaty came into force in 1975. The treaty, and the national legislation that supports it, provides a legal framework for preventing “listed” species from being transported across nations’ borders, thus protecting them from being caught or killed in the first place when the purpose involves international trade. The listed species that are protected to one degree or another by the treaty number some 33,000. The treaty is limited in its reach because it only deals with international movement of organisms or their parts. It is also limited by various countries’ ability or willingness to enforce the treaty and supporting legislation. The illegal trade in organisms and their parts is probably a market in the hundreds of millions of dollars.<br/>Within many countries there are laws that protect endangered species and that regulate hunting and fishing. In the United States, the Endangered Species Act was enacted in 1973. When an at-risk species is listed by the Act, the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service is required by law to develop a management plan to protect the species and bring it back to sustainable numbers. The Act, and others like it in other countries, is a useful tool, but it suffers because it is often difficult to get a species listed, or to get an effective management plan in place once a species is listed. Additionally, species may be controversially taken off the list without necessarily having had a change in their situation. More fundamentally, the approach to protecting individual species rather than entire ecosystems (although the management plans commonly involve</p><p class="s20">586                                                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity</p><p>protection of the individual species’ habitat) is both inefficient and focuses efforts on a few highly visible and often charismatic species, perhaps at the expense of other species that go unprotected.<br/>The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) is an agreement between the United States and Canada that was signed into law in 1918 in response to declines in North American bird species caused by hunting. The Act now lists over 800 protected species. It makes it illegal to disturb or kill the protected species or distribute their parts (much of the hunting of birds in the past was for their feathers). Examples of protected species include northern cardinals, the red-tailed hawk, and the American black vulture.<br/>Global warming is expected to be a major driver of biodiversity loss. Many governments are concerned about the effects of anthropogenic global warming, primarily on their economies and food resources. Since greenhouse gas emissions do not respect national boundaries, the effort to curb them is an international one. The international response to global warming has been mixed. The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement that came out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that committed countries to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, was ratified by some countries, but spurned by others. Two countries that were especially important in terms of their potential impact that did not ratify the Kyoto protocol were the United States and China. Some goals for reduction in greenhouse gasses were met and exceeded by individual countries, but, worldwide, the effort to limit greenhouse gas production is not succeeding. The intended replacement for the Kyoto Protocol has not materialized because governments cannot agree on timelines and benchmarks. Meanwhile, the resulting costs to human societies and biodiversity predicted by a majority of climate scientists will be high.<br/>As already mentioned, the non-profit, non-governmental sector plays a large role in conservation effort both in North America and around the world. The approaches range from species-specific organizations to the broadly focused IUCN and Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC). The Nature Conservancy takes a novel approach. It purchases land and protects it in an attempt to set up preserves for ecosystems. Ultimately, human behavior will change when human values change. At present, the growing urbanization of the human population is a force that mitigates against valuing biodiversity, because many people no longer come in contact with natural environments and the species that inhabit them.</p><p class="s34">Conservation in Preserves</p><p>Establishment of wildlife and ecosystem preserves is one of the key tools in conservation efforts (<span class="s32">Figure 21.16</span>). A preserve is an area of land set aside with varying degrees of protection for the organisms that exist within the boundaries of the preserve. Preserves can be effective for protecting both species and ecosystems, but they have some serious drawbacks.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="182" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_852.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.16  <span class="s30">National  parks,  such  as Grand  Teton  National  Park  in Wyoming, help conserve biodiversity.  (credit: Don</span></p><p class="s30">DeBold)</p><p>A simple measure of success in setting aside preserves for biodiversity protection is to set a target percentage of land or marine habitat to protect. However, a more detailed preserve design and choice of location is usually necessary because of the way protected lands are allocated and how biodiversity is distributed: protected lands tend to contain less economically valuable resources rather than being set aside specifically for the species or ecosystems at risk. In 2003, the IUCN World Parks Congress estimated that 11.5 percent of Earth’s land surface was covered by preserves of various kinds. This area is greater than previous goals; however, it only represents 9 out of 14 recognized major biomes and research has shown that<br/>12 percent of all species live outside preserves; these percentages are much higher when threatened species are considered and when only high quality preserves are considered. For example, high quality preserves include only about 50 percent of threatened amphibian species. The conclusion must be that either the percentage of area protected must be increased, the percentage of high quality preserves must be increased, or preserves must be targeted with greater attention to biodiversity protection. Researchers argue that more attention to the latter solution is required.<br/>A <b>biodiversity hotspot </b>is a conservation concept developed by Norman Myers in 1988. Hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species. The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity                                                                                                                                                                                         587</p><p>for conservation efforts, a kind of conservation triage. By protecting hotspots, governments are able to protect a larger number of species. The original criteria for a hotspot included the presence of 1500 or more species of endemic plants and<br/>70 percent of the area disturbed by human activity. There are now 34 biodiversity hotspots (<span class="s32">Figure 21.17</span>) that contain large numbers of endemic species, which include half of Earth’s endemic plants.<br/><span><IMG width="530" height="305" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_853.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.17  <span class="s30">Conservation International has  identified 34 biodiversity hotspots. Although these cover only 2.3 percent of the Earth’s surface, 42 percent of the terrestrial vertebrate species and 50 percent of the world’s plants  are endemic to those hotspots.</span></p><p>There has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity. The fundamental principles behind much of the research have come from the seminal theoretical work of Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson</p><p class="s55">[2]</p><p>published in 1967 on island biogeography.<br/>This work sought to understand the factors affecting biodiversity on islands.<br/>Conservation preserves can be seen as “islands” of habitat within “an ocean” of non-habitat. In general, large preserves are better because they support more species, including species with large home ranges; they have more core area of optimal habitat for individual species; they have more niches to support more species; and they attract more species because they can be found and reached more easily.<br/>Preserves perform better when there are partially protected buffer zones around them of suboptimal habitat. The buffer allows organisms to exit the boundaries of the preserve without immediate negative consequences from hunting or lack of resources. One large preserve is better than the same area of several smaller preserves because there is more core habitat unaffected by less hospitable ecosystems outside the preserve boundary. For this same reason, preserves in the shape of a square or circle will be better than a preserve with many thin “arms.” If preserves must be smaller, then providing wildlife corridors between them so that species and their genes can move between the preserves; for example, preserves along rivers and streams will make the smaller preserves behave more like a large one. All of these factors are taken into consideration when planning the nature of a preserve before the land is set aside.<br/>In addition to the physical specifications of a preserve, there are a variety of regulations related to the use of a preserve. These  can  include  anything  from  timber  extraction,  mineral  extraction,  regulated  hunting,  human  habitation,  and nondestructive human recreation. Many of the decisions to include these other uses are made based on political pressures rather than conservation considerations. On the other hand, in some cases, wildlife protection policies have been so strict that subsistence-living indigenous populations have been forced from ancestral lands that fell within a preserve. In other cases, even if a preserve is designed to protect wildlife, if the protections are not or cannot be enforced, the preserve status will have little meaning in the face of illegal poaching and timber extraction. This is a widespread problem with preserves in the tropics.<br/>Some of the limitations on preserves as conservation tools are evident from the discussion of preserve design. Political and economic pressures typically make preserves smaller, never larger, so setting aside areas that are large enough is difficult. Enforcement of protections is also a significant issue in countries without the resources or political will to prevent poaching and illegal resource extraction.<br/><span><IMG width="622" height="1" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_854.png"/></span></p><p class="s54">2.

Creating preserves reduces the pressure on human activities outside the preserves to be sustainable and non-damaging to biodiversity. Ultimately, the political, economic, and human demographic pressures will degrade and reduce the size of conservation preserves if the activities outside them are not altered to be less damaging to biodiversity.<br/><span><IMG width="213" height="61" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_856.png"/></span></p><p class="s32"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/protected_area2" class="s25">Check out this </a>interactive global data system (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/protected_area2) <span class="p">of protected areas.

Of course once a species has become extinct, its restoration is impossible. However, restoration can improve the biodiversity of degraded ecosystems. Reintroducing wolves, a top predator, to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 led to dramatic changes in the ecosystem that increased biodiversity. The wolves (<span class="s32">Figure 21.18</span>) function to suppress elk and coyote populations and provide more abundant resources to the guild of carrion eaters. Reducing elk populations has allowed revegetation of riparian (the areas along the banks of a stream or river) areas, which has increased the diversity of species in that habitat. Suppression of coyotes has increased the species previously suppressed by this predator. The number of species of carrion eaters has increased because of the predatory activities of the wolves. In this habitat, the wolf is a keystone species, meaning a species that is instrumental in maintaining diversity within an ecosystem. Removing a keystone species from an ecological community causes a collapse in diversity. The results from the Yellowstone experiment suggest that restoring a keystone species effectively can have the effect of restoring biodiversity in the community. Ecologists have argued for the identification of keystone species where possible and for focusing protection efforts on these species. It makes sense to return the keystone species to the ecosystems where they have been removed.<br/><span><IMG width="320" height="218" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_857.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure 21.18  <span class="s30">This photograph shows the Gibbon wolf pack in Yellowstone National Park,  March 1, 2007.

In the United States, since the mid-1980s, many aging dams are being considered for removal rather than replacement because of shifting beliefs about the ecological value of free-flowing rivers. The measured benefits of dam removal include restoration of naturally fluctuating water levels (often the purpose of dams is to reduce variation in river flows), which leads to increased fish diversity and improved water<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity                                                                                                                                                                                         589</p><p>quality. In the Pacific Northwest, dam removal projects are expected to increase populations of salmon, which is considered a keystone species because it transports nutrients to inland ecosystems during its annual spawning migrations. In other regions, such as the Atlantic coast, dam removal has allowed the return of other spawning anadromous fish species (species that are born in fresh water, live most of their lives in salt water, and return to fresh water to spawn). Some of the largest dam removal projects have yet to occur or have happened too recently for the consequences to be measured. The large-scale ecological experiments that these removal projects constitute will provide valuable data for other dam projects slated either for removal or construction.</p><p class="s34">The Role  of Zoos and Captive Breeding</p><p>Zoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both through captive breeding programs and education (<span class="s32">Figure</span></p><p class="s32">21.19<span class="p">). The transformation of the missions of zoos from collection and exhibition facilities to organizations that are dedicated to conservation is ongoing. In general, it has been recognized that, except in some specific targeted cases, captive breeding programs for endangered species are inefficient and often prone to failure when the species are reintroduced to the wild. Zoo facilities are far too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the numbers of species that are now at risk. Education, on the other hand, is a potential positive impact of zoos on conservation efforts, particularly given the global trend to urbanization and the consequent reduction in contacts between people and wildlife. A number of studies have been performed to look at the effectiveness of zoos on people’s attitudes and actions regarding conservation; at present, the results tend to be mixed.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="250" height="306" src="openstax_conceptsbiology/Image_858.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29">Figure  21.19  <span class="s30">Zoos  and  captive  breeding programs help preserve many  endangered species, such  as this golden  lion tamarin.

These include numbers of species, genetic diversity, chemical diversity, and ecosystem diversity. The number of described species is estimated to be 1.5 million with about 17,000 new species being described each year. Estimates for the total number of eukaryotic species on Earth vary but are on the order of 10 million. Biodiversity is negatively correlated with latitude for most taxa, meaning that biodiversity is higher in the tropics. The mechanism for this pattern is not known with certainty, but several plausible hypotheses have been advanced.<br/>Humans use many compounds that were first discovered or derived from living organisms as medicines: secondary plant compounds, animal toxins, and antibiotics produced by bacteria and fungi. More medicines are expected to be discovered in nature. Loss of biodiversity will impact the number of pharmaceuticals available to humans. Biodiversity may provide important psychological benefits to humans.<br/>Crop diversity is a requirement for food security, and it is being lost. The loss of wild relatives to crops also threatens breeders’ abilities to create new varieties. Ecosystems provide ecosystem services that support human agriculture: pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control, and soil development and maintenance. Loss of biodiversity threatens these ecosystem services and risks making food production more expensive or impossible. Wild food sources are mainly<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11487/1.9</a></p><p class="s20">Chapter 21 | Conservation and Biodiversity                                                                                                                                                                                         591</p><p>aquatic, but few are being managed for sustainability. Fisheries’ ability to provide protein to human populations is threatened when extinction occurs.</p><p class="s52">21.2 Threats  to Biodiversity</p><p>The core threats to biodiversity are human population growth and unsustainable resource use. To date, the most significant causes of extinction are habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and overharvesting. Climate change is predicted to be a significant cause of extinction in the coming century. Habitat loss occurs through deforestation, damming of rivers, and other activities. Overharvesting is a threat particularly to aquatic species, but the taking of bush meat in the humid tropics threatens many species in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Exotic species have been the cause of a number of extinctions and are especially damaging to islands and lakes. Exotic species’ introductions are increasing because of the increased mobility of human populations and growing global trade and transportation. Climate change is forcing range changes that may lead to extinction. It is also affecting adaptations to the timing of resource availability that negatively affects species<br/>in seasonal environments. The impacts of climate change are currently greatest in the arctic. Global warming will also raise sea levels, eliminating some islands and reducing the area of all others.</p><p class="s52">21.3 Preserving Biodiversity</p><p>Five mass extinctions with losses of more than 50 percent of extant species are observable in the fossil record. Recent extinctions are recorded in written history and are the basis for one method of estimating contemporary extinction rates. The other method uses measures of habitat loss and species-area relationships. Estimates of contemporary extinction rates vary but are as high as 500 times the background rate, as determined from the fossil record, and are predicted to rise.<br/>There is a legislative framework for biodiversity protection. International treaties such as CITES regulate the transportation of endangered species across international borders. Legislation within individual countries protecting species and agreements on global warming have had limited success; there is at present no international agreement on targets for greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, the Endangered Species Act protects listed species but is hampered by procedural difficulties and a focus on individual species. The Migratory Bird Act is an agreement between<br/>Canada and the United States to protect migratory birds. The non-profit sector is also very active in conservation efforts in a variety of ways.<br/>Conservation preserves are a major tool in biodiversity protection. Presently, 11 percent of Earth’s land surface is protected in some way. The science of island biogeography has informed the optimal design of preserves; however, preserves have limitations imposed by political and economic forces. In addition, climate change will limit the effectiveness of present preserves in the future. A downside of preserves is that they may lessen the pressure on human societies to function more sustainably outside the preserves.<br/>Habitat restoration has the potential to restore ecosystems to previous biodiversity levels before species become extinct. Examples of restoration include reintroduction of keystone species and removal of dams on rivers. Zoos have attempted to take a more active role in conservation and can have a limited role in captive breeding programs. Zoos also have a useful role in education.</p><p class="s24">ART CONNECTION QUESTIONS</p><p class="s27">1. <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 21.6 </span><span class="p">The Svalbard seed vault is located on Spitsbergen island in Norway, which has an arctic climate.

For instance, an ecologist may study a population of individuals, the population’s community, the community’s ecosystem, and the ecosystem’s part in the biosphere. When studying an individual organism, a biologist could examine the cell and its organelles, the tissues that the cells make up, the organs and their respective organ systems, and the sum total—the organism itself.</span></p><p class="s111">Chapter 2</p><p class="s59">1 <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 2.3 </span><span class="s30">Potassium-39 has twenty neutrons.

They provide the structure and shape necessary for proteins and DNA within cells so that they function properly. Hydrogen bonds also give water its unique properties, which are necessary for life.  </span>14 <span class="s30">Water molecules are polar, meaning they have separated partial positive and negative charges. Because of these charges, water molecules are able to surround charged particles created when a substance dissociates. The surrounding layer of water molecules stabilizes the ion and keeps differently charged ions from reassociating, so the substance stays dissolved.  </span>16 <span class="s30">A change in gene sequence can lead to a different amino acid being added to a polypeptide chain instead of the normal one. This causes a change in protein structure and function. For example, in sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin β chain has a single amino acid substitution. Because of this change, the disc-shaped red blood cells assume a crescent shape, which can result in serious health problems.</span></p><p class="s111">Chapter 3</p><p class="s59">1 <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 3.7 </span><span class="s30">Plant cells have plasmodesmata, a cell wall, a large central vacuole, chloroplasts, and plastids.

However, typical light microscopes are somewhat limited in the amount of detail that they can reveal. Electron microscopes are ideal because you can view intricate details, but they are bulky and costly, and preparation for the microscopic examination kills the specimen. Transmission electron microscopes are designed to examine the internal structures of a cell, whereas a scanning electron microscope only allows visualization of the surface of a structure.  </span>17 <span class="s30">“Form follows function” refers to the idea that the function of a body part dictates the form of that body part. As an example, organisms like birds or fish that fly or swim quickly through the air or water have streamlined bodies that reduce drag. At the level of the cell, in tissues involved in secretory functions, such as the salivary glands, the cells have abundant Golgi.  </span>19 <span class="s30">Water moves through a semipermeable membrane in osmosis because there is a concentration gradient across the membrane of solute and solvent. The solute cannot effectively move to balance the concentration on both sides of the membrane, so water moves to achieve this balance.</span></p><p class="s111">Chapter 4</p><p class="s59">1 <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 4.6  </span><span class="s30">A compost pile decomposing is an exergonic process.

Body cells break down sugars to provide ATP to do the work necessary for exercise, such as muscle contractions. This is catabolism. Muscle cells also must repair muscle tissue damaged by exercise by building new muscle. This is anabolism.  </span>16 <span class="s30">Most vitamins and minerals act as cofactors and coenzymes for enzyme action. Many enzymes require the binding of certain cofactors or coenzymes to be able to catalyze their reactions. Since enzymes catalyze many important reactions, it is critical to obtain sufficient vitamins and minerals from diet and supplements. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a coenzyme necessary for the action of enzymes that build collagen.  </span>18 <span class="s30">The oxygen we inhale is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain and allows aerobic respiration to proceed, which is the most efficient pathway for harvesting energy in the form of ATP from food molecules. The carbon dioxide we breathe out is formed during the citric acid cycle when the bonds in carbon compounds are broken.  </span>20 <span class="s30">They are very economical. The substrates, intermediates, and products move between pathways and do so in response to finely tuned feedback inhibition loops that keep metabolism overall on an even keel. Intermediates in one pathway may occur in another, and they can move from one pathway to another fluidly in response to the needs of the cell.</span></p><p class="s111">Chapter 5</p><p class="s59">1 <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 5.7 </span><span class="s30">Levels of carbon dioxide (a reactant) will fall, and levels of oxygen (a product) will rise.

The energy of the electrochemical gradient is used to power ATP synthase, and the energy is transferred into a bond in the ATP molecule. In addition, energy from another photon can be used to create a high-energy bond in the molecule NADPH.  <b>16 </b>Photosynthesis takes the energy of sunlight and combines water and carbon dioxide to produce sugar and oxygen as a waste product. The reactions of respiration take sugar and consume oxygen to break it down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy. Thus, the reactants of photosynthesis are the products of respiration, and vice versa.</p><p class="s111">Chapter 6</p><p class="s59">1 <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 6.4 </span><span class="s30">D.

This is the <i>n, </i>or haploid, condition.  <b>14 </b>If one of the genes that produce regulator proteins becomes mutated, it produces a malformed, possibly non-functional, cell-cycle regulator. This increases the chance that more mutations will be left unrepaired in the cell. Each subsequent generation of cells sustains more damage. The cell cycle can speed up as a result of loss of functional checkpoint proteins. The cells can lose the ability to self-destruct.  <b>16 </b>The common components of eukaryotic cell division and binary fission are DNA duplication, segregation of duplicated chromosomes, and the division of the cytoplasmic contents.</p><p class="s111">Chapter 7</p><p class="s59">1 <span style=" color: #C63;">Figure 7.2  </span><span class="s30">Yes, it will be able to reproduce asexually.  </span>2 <span class="s30">C  </span>4 <span class="s30">B  </span>6 <span class="s30">D  </span>8 <span class="s30">B  </span>10 <span class="s30">D  </span>12 <span class="s30">The offspring of sexually reproducing organisms are all genetically unique. Because of this, sexually reproducing organisms may have more successful survival of offspring in environments that change than asexually reproducing organisms, whose offspring are all genetically identical. In addition, the rate of adaptation of sexually reproducing organisms is higher, because of their increased variation. This may allow sexually reproducing organisms to adapt more quickly to competitors and parasites, who are evolving new ways to exploit or outcompete them.  </span>14 <span class="s30">Random alignment leads to new combinations of traits. The chromosomes that were originally inherited by the gamete-producing individual came equally from the egg and the sperm. In metaphase I, the duplicated copies of these maternal and paternal homologous chromosomes line up across the center of the cell to form a tetrad. The orientation of each tetrad is random. There is an equal chance that the maternally derived chromosomes will be facing either pole. The same is true of the paternally derived chromosomes. The alignment should occur differently in almost every meiosis.
