this nasa image be a composite of several satellite   -   base view of earth   .
to make the whole   -   earth image   ,   nasa scientist combine observation of different part of the planet   .
view from space   ,   earth offer no clue about the diversity of life form that reside there   .
the first form of life on earth be think to have be microorganism that exist for billion of year in the ocean before plant and animal appear   .
the mammal   ,   bird   ,   and flower so familiar to -PRON- be all relatively recent   ,   originate   one   three   zero   to   two   zero   zero   million year ago   .
human have inhabit this planet for only the last   two    .    five   million year   ,   and only in the last   two   zero   zero    ,    zero   zero   zero   year have human start look like -PRON- do today   .

(   credit a    modification of work by nasa    credit b    modification of work by ruth ellison    scale   -   bar datum from matt russell   )   what be biology   ?
in simple term   ,   biology be the study of live organism and -PRON- interaction with one another and -PRON- environment   .
this be a very broad definition because the scope of biology be vast   .
biologist may study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic view of a cell to ecosystem and the whole live planet   (   figure   one    .    two    )    .   listen to the daily news   ,   -PRON- will quickly realize how many aspect of biology be discuss every day   .
for example   ,   recent news topic include escherichia coli   (   figure   one    .    three    )   outbreak in spinach and salmonella contamination in peanut butter   .
other subject include effort toward find a cure for aid   ,   alzheimer ' s disease   ,   and cancer   .
on a global scale   ,   many researcher be commit to find way to protect the planet   ,   solve environmental issue   ,   and reduce the effect of climate change   .
all of these diverse endeavor be relate to different facet of the discipline of biology   .
figure   one    .    three   escherichia coli   (   e   .   coli   )   bacteria   ,   see in this scanning electron micrograph   ,   be normal resident of -PRON- digestive tract that aid in the absorption of vitamin k and other nutrient   .
however   ,   virulent strain be sometimes responsible for disease outbreak   .    (   credit    eric erbe   ,   digital colorization by christopher pooley   ,   both of usda   ,   ars   ,   emu   )   the process of science biology be a science   ,   but what exactly be science   ?
what do the study of biology share with other scientific discipline   ?
science   (   from the latin scientia   ,   mean " knowledge "   )   can be define as knowledge that cover general truth or the operation of general law   ,   especially when acquire and test by the scientific method   .
-PRON- become clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method play a major role in science   .
the scientific method be a method of research with define step that include experiment and careful observation   .
the step of the scientific method will be examine in detail later   ,   but one of the most important aspect of this method be the testing of hypothesis by mean of repeatable experiment   .
a hypothesis be a suggest explanation for an event   ,   which can be test   .
although use the scientific method be inherent to science   ,   -PRON- be inadequate in determine what science be   .
this be because -PRON- be relatively easy to apply the scientific method to discipline such as physics and chemistry   ,   but when -PRON- come to discipline like archaeology   ,   psychology   ,   and geology   ,   the scientific method become less applicable as -PRON- become more difficult to repeat experiment   .
these area of study be still science   ,   however   .
consider archeology -- even though one can not perform repeatable experiment   ,   hypothesis may still be support   .
for instance   ,   an archeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture exist base on find a piece of pottery   .
further hypothesis could be make about various characteristic of this culture   ,   and these hypothesis may be find to be correct or false through continued support or contradiction from other finding   .
a hypothesis may become a verified theory   .
a theory be a test and confirm explanation for observation or phenomenon   .
science may be better define as field of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe   .
what would -PRON- expect to see in a museum of natural science   ?
frog   ?
plant   ?
dinosaur skeleton   ?
exhibit about how the brain function   ?
a planetarium   ?
gem and mineral   ?
or   ,   maybe all of the above   ?
science include such diverse field as astronomy   ,   biology   ,   computer science   ,   geology   ,   logic   ,   physics   ,   chemistry   ,   and mathematic   (   figure   one    .    four    )    .   however   ,   those field of science relate to the physical world and -PRON- phenomenon and process be consider natural science   .
thus   ,   a museum of natural science may contain any of the item list above   .
figure   one    .    four   the diversity of scientific field include astronomy   ,   biology   ,   computer science   ,   geology   ,   logic   ,   physics   ,   chemistry   ,   mathematic   ,   and many other field   .    (   credit    " image editor "   /   flickr   )   there be no complete agreement when -PRON- come to define what the natural science include   ,   however   .
for some expert   ,   the natural science be astronomy   ,   biology   ,   chemistry   ,   earth science   ,   and physics   .
other scholar choose to divide natural science into life science   ,   which study live thing and include biology   ,   and physical science   ,   which study nonliv matter and include astronomy   ,   geology   ,   physics   ,   and chemistry   .
some discipline such as biophysic and biochemistry build on both life and physical science and be interdisciplinary   .
natural science be sometimes refer to as " hard science " because -PRON- rely on the use of quantitative datum    social science that study society and human behavior be more likely to use qualitative assessment to drive investigation and finding   .
not surprisingly   ,   the natural science of biology have many branch or subdiscipline   .
cell biologist study cell structure and function   ,   while biologist who study anatomy investigate the structure of an entire organism   .
those biologist study physiology   ,   however   ,   focus on the internal functioning of an organism   .
some area of biology focus on only particular type of live thing   .
for example   ,   botanist explore plant   ,   while zoologist specialize in animal   .
scientific reasoning one thing be common to all form of science    an ultimate goal " to know   .
" curiosity and inquiry be the drive force for the development of science   .
scientist seek to understand the world and the way -PRON- operate   .
to do this   ,   -PRON- use two method of logical thinking    inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning   .
inductive reasoning be a form of logical thinking that use relate observation to arrive at a general conclusion   .
this type of reasoning be common in descriptive science   .
a life scientist such as a biologist make observation and record -PRON-   .
these datum can be qualitative or quantitative   ,   and the raw datum can be supplement with drawing   ,   picture   ,   photo   ,   or video   .
from many observation   ,   the scientist can infer conclusion   (   induction   )   base on evidence   .
inductive reasoning involve formulate generalization infer from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of datum   .
brain study provide an example   .
in this type of research   ,   many live brain be observe while people be do a specific activity   ,   such as view image of food   .
the part of the brain that " light up " during this activity be then predict to be the part control the response to the select stimulus   ,   in this case   ,   image of food   .
the " light up " of the various area of the brain be cause by excess absorption of radioactive sugar derivative by active area of the brain   .
the resultant increase in radioactivity be observe by a scanner   .
then   ,   researcher can stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar response result   .
deductive reasoning or deduction be the type of logic use in hypothesis   -   base science   .
in deductive reason   ,   the pattern of think move in the opposite direction as compare to inductive reasoning   .
deductive reasoning be a form of logical thinking that use a general principle or law to forecast specific result   .
from those general principle   ,   a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific result that would be valid as long as the general principle be valid   .
study in climate change can illustrate this type of reasoning   .
for example   ,   scientist may predict that if the climate become warm in a particular region   ,   then the distribution of plant and animal should change   .
these prediction have be make and test   ,   and many such change have be find   ,   such as the modification of arable area for agriculture   ,   with change base on temperature average   .
both type of logical thinking be relate to the two main pathway of scientific study    descriptive science and hypothesisbased science   .
descriptive   (   or discovery   )   science   ,   which be usually inductive   ,   aim to observe   ,   explore   ,   and discover   ,   while hypothesis   -   base science   ,   which be usually deductive   ,   begin with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be test   .
the boundary between these two form of study be often blur   ,   and most scientific endeavor combine both approach   .
the fuzzy boundary become apparent when think about how easily observation can lead to specific question   .
for example   ,   a gentleman in the   one   nine   four   zero s observe that the burr seed that stick to -PRON- clothe and -PRON- dog ' s fur have a tiny hook structure   .
on close inspection   ,   -PRON- discover that the burr ’ grip device be more reliable than a zipper   .
-PRON- eventually develop a company and produce the hook   -   and   -   loop fastener popularly know today as velcro   .
descriptive science and hypothesis   -   base science be in continuous dialogue   .
the scientific method biologist study the live world by pose question about -PRON- and seek science   -   base response   .
this approach be common to other science as well and be often refer to as the scientific method   .
the scientific method be use even in ancient time   ,   but -PRON- be first document by england ' s sir francis bacon   (    one   five   six   one   –   one   six   two   six    )    (   figure   one    .    five    )    ,   who set up inductive method for scientific inquiry   .
the scientific method be not exclusively use by biologist but can be apply to almost all field of study as a logical   ,   rational problem   -   solve method   .
sir franci bacon   (    one   five   six   one   –   one   six   two   six    )   be credit with be the first to define the scientific method   .    (   credit    paul van somer   )   the scientific process typically start with an observation   (   often a problem to be solve   )   that lead to a question   .
let ’ s think about a simple problem that start with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem   .
one monday morning   ,   a student arrive at class and quickly discover that the classroom be too warm   .
that be an observation that also describe a problem    the classroom be too warm   .
the student then ask a question    " why be the classroom so warm   ?
" propose a hypothesis recall that a hypothesis be a suggest explanation that can be test   .
to solve a problem   ,   several hypothesis may be propose   .
for example   ,   one hypothesis may be   ,   " the classroom be warm because no one turn on the air conditioning   .   " but there could be other response to the question   ,   and therefore other hypothesis may be propose   .
a second hypothesis may be   ,   " the classroom be warm because there be a power failure   ,   and so the air conditioning doesn ' t work   .
" once a hypothesis have be select   ,   the student can make a prediction   .
a prediction be similar to a hypothesis but -PRON- typically have the format " if   .    .    .   then   .
.    .    .   " for example   ,   the prediction for the first hypothesis may be   ,   " if the student turn on the air conditioning   ,   then the classroom will no longer be too warm   .   " test a hypothesis a valid hypothesis must be testable   .
-PRON- should also be falsifiable   ,   mean that -PRON- can be disproven by experimental result   .
importantly   ,   science do not claim to " prove " anything because scientific understanding be always subject to modification with further information   .
this step -- openness to disprove idea -- be what distinguish science from nonscience   .
the presence of the supernatural   ,   for instance   ,   be neither testable nor falsifiable   .
to test a hypothesis   ,   a researcher will conduct one or more experiment design to eliminate one or more of the hypothesis   .
each experiment will have one or more variable and one or more control   .
a variable be any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment   .
the control group contain every feature of the experimental group except -PRON- be not give the manipulation that be hypothesize about   .
therefore   ,   if the result of the experimental group differ from the control group   ,   the difference must be due to the hypothesize manipulation   ,   rather than some outside factor   .
look for the variable and control in the example that follow   .
to test the first hypothesis   ,   the student would find out if the air conditioning be on   .
if the air conditioning be turn on but do not work   ,   there should be another reason   ,   and this hypothesis should be reject   .
to test the second hypothesis   ,   the student could check if the light in the classroom be functional   .
if so   ,   there be no power failure and this hypothesis should be reject   .
each hypothesis should be test by carry out appropriate experiment   .
be aware that reject one hypothesis do not determine whether or not the other hypothesis can be accept    -PRON- simply eliminate one hypothesis that be not valid   (   figure   one    .    six    )    .   use the scientific method   ,   the hypothesis that be inconsistent with experimental datum be reject   .
while this " warm classroom " example be base on observational result   ,   other hypothesis and experiment may have clear control   .
for instance   ,   a student may attend class on monday and realize -PRON- have difficulty concentrate on the lecture   .
one observation to explain this occurrence may be   ,   " when i eat breakfast before class   ,   i be better able to pay attention   .   " the student could then design an experiment with a control to test this hypothesis   .
in hypothesis   -   base science   ,   specific result be predict from a general premise   .
this type of reasoning be call deductive reasoning    deduction proceed from the general to the particular   .
but the reverse of the process be also possible    sometimes   ,   scientist reach a general conclusion from a number of specific observation   .
this type of reasoning be call inductive reasoning   ,   and -PRON- proceed from the particular to the general   .
inductive and deductive reasoning be often use in tandem to advance scientific knowledge   (   figure   one    .    seven    )    .   the scientific method may seem too rigid and structured   .
-PRON- be important to keep in mind that   ,   although scientist often follow this sequence   ,   there be flexibility   .
sometimes an experiment lead to conclusion that favor a change in approach    often   ,   an experiment bring entirely new scientific question to the puzzle   .
many time   ,   science do not operate in a linear fashion    instead   ,   scientist continually draw inference and make generalization   ,   find pattern as -PRON- research proceed   .
scientific reasoning be more complex than the scientific method alone suggest   .
notice   ,   too   ,   that the scientific method can be apply to solve problem that aren ’ t necessarily scientific in nature   .
two type of science    basic science and apply science the scientific community have be debate for the last few decade about the value of different type of science   .
be -PRON- valuable to pursue science for the sake of simply gain knowledge   ,   or do scientific knowledge only have worth if -PRON- can apply -PRON- to solve a specific problem or to better -PRON- life   ?
this question focus on the difference between two type of science    basic science and apply science   .
basic science or " pure " science seek to expand knowledge regardless of the short   -   term application of that knowledge   .
-PRON- be not focus on develop a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value   .
the immediate goal of basic science be knowledge for knowledge ' s sake   ,   though this do not mean that   ,   in the end   ,   -PRON- may not result in a practical application   .
in contrast   ,   apply science or " technology   ,   " aim to use science to solve real   -   world problem   ,   make -PRON- possible   ,   for example   ,   to improve a crop yield   ,   find a cure for a particular disease   ,   or save animal threaten by a natural disaster   (   figure   one    .    eight    )    .   in apply science   ,   the problem be usually define for the researcher   .
figure   one    .    eight   after hurricane ike strike the gulf coast in   two   zero   zero   eight    ,   the u   .   s   .   fish and wildlife service rescue this brown pelican   .
thank to apply science   ,   scientist know how to rehabilitate the bird   .    (   credit    fema   )   some individual may perceive apply science as " useful " and basic science as " useless   .   " a question these people may pose to a scientist advocate knowledge acquisition would be   ,   " what for   ?
" a careful look at the history of science   ,   however   ,   reveal that basic knowledge have result in many remarkable application of great value   .
many scientist think that a basic understanding of science be necessary before an application be develop    therefore   ,   apply science relie on the result generate through basic science   .
other scientist think that -PRON- be time to move on from basic science and instead to find solution to actual problem   .
both approach be valid   .
-PRON- be true that there be problem that demand immediate attention    however   ,   few solution would be find without the help of the wide knowledge foundation generate through basic science   .
one example of how basic and apply science can work together to solve practical problem occur after the discovery of dna structure lead to an understanding of the molecular mechanism govern dna replication   .
strand of dna   ,   unique in every human   ,   be find in -PRON- cell   ,   where -PRON- provide the instruction necessary for life   .
during dna replication   ,   dna make new copy of -PRON-   ,   shortly before a cell divide   .
understand the mechanism of dna replication enable scientist to develop laboratory technique that be now use to identify genetic disease   ,   pinpoint individual who be at a crime scene   ,   and determine paternity   .
without basic science   ,   -PRON- be unlikely that apply science would exist   .
another example of the link between basic and applied research be the human genome project   ,   a study in which each human chromosome be analyze and map to determine the precise sequence of dna subunit and the exact location of each gene   .    (   the gene be the basic unit of heredity    an individual ' s complete collection of gene be -PRON- or -PRON- genome   .    )   other less complex organism have also be study as part of this project in order to gain a good understanding of human chromosome   .
the human genome project   (   figure   one    .    nine    )   rely on basic research carry out with simple organism and   ,   later   ,   with the human genome   .
an important end goal eventually become use the datum for applied research   ,   seek cure and early diagnosis for genetically relate disease   .
figure   one    .    nine   the human genome project be a   one   three    -   year collaborative effort among researcher work in several different field of science   .
the project   ,   which sequence the entire human genome   ,   be complete in   two   zero   zero   three    .    (   credit    the u   .   s   .   department of energy genome program   (   http     /    /   genomic   .   energy   .   gov   )    )   while research effort in both basic science and apply science be usually carefully plan   ,   -PRON- be important to note that some discovery be make by serendipity   ,   that be   ,   by mean of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise   .
penicillin be discover when biologist alexander flem accidentally leave a petri dish of staphylococcus bacteria open   .
an unwanted mold grow on the dish   ,   kill the bacteria   .
the mold turn out to be penicillium   ,   and a new antibiotic be discover   .
even in the highly organize world of science   ,   luck -- when combine with an observant   ,   curious mind -- can lead to unexpected breakthrough   .
report scientific work whether scientific research be basic science or apply science   ,   scientist must share -PRON- finding in order for other researcher to expand and build upon -PRON- discovery   .
collaboration with other scientist -- when planning   ,   conduct   ,   and analyzing result -- be all important for scientific research   .
for this reason   ,   important aspect of a scientist ' s work be communicate with peer and disseminate result to peer   .
scientist can share result by present -PRON- at a scientific meeting or conference   ,   but this approach can reach only the select few who be present   .
instead   ,   most scientist present -PRON- result in peer   -   review manuscript that be publish in scientific journal   .
peer   -   review manuscript be scientific paper that be review by a scientist ' s colleague   ,   or peer   .
these colleague be qualified individual   ,   often expert in the same research area   ,   who judge whether or not the scientist ' s work be suitable for publication   .
the process of peer review help to ensure that the research describe in a scientific paper or grant proposal be original   ,   significant   ,   logical   ,   and thorough   .
grant proposal   ,   which be request for research funding   ,   be also subject to peer review   .
scientist publish -PRON- work so other scientist can reproduce -PRON- experiment under similar or different condition to expand on the finding   .
the experimental result must be consistent with the finding of other scientist   .
a scientific paper be very different from creative writing   .
although creativity be require to design experiment   ,   there be fix guideline when -PRON- come to present scientific result   .
first   ,   scientific writing must be brief   ,   concise   ,   and accurate   .
a scientific paper need to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peer to reproduce the experiment   .
the scientific paper consist of several specific section -- introduction   ,   material and method   ,   result   ,   and discussion   .
this structure be sometimes call the " imrad " format   .
there be usually acknowledgment and reference section as well as an abstract   (   a concise summary   )   at the beginning of the paper   .
there may be additional section depend on the type of paper and the journal where -PRON- will be publish    for example   ,   some review paper require an outline   .
the introduction start with brief   ,   but broad   ,   background information about what be know in the field   .
a good introduction also give the rationale of the work    -PRON- justify the work carry out and also briefly mention the end of the paper   ,   where the hypothesis or research question drive the research will be present   .
the introduction refer to the published scientific work of other and therefore require citation follow the style of the journal   .
use the work or idea of other without proper citation be consider plagiarism   .
the material and method section include a complete and accurate description of the substance use   ,   and the method and technique use by the researcher to gather datum   .
the description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to repeat the experiment and obtain similar result   ,   but -PRON- do not have to be verbose   .
this section will also include information on how measurement be make and what type of calculation and statistical analysis be use to examine raw data   .
although the material and method section give an accurate description of the experiment   ,   -PRON- do not discuss -PRON-   .
some journal require a result section follow by a discussion section   ,   but -PRON- be more common to combine both   .
if the journal do not allow the combination of both section   ,   the result section simply narrate the finding without any further interpretation   .
the result be present by mean of table or graph   ,   but no duplicate information should be present   .
in the discussion section   ,   the researcher will interpret the result   ,   describe how variable may be relate   ,   and attempt to explain the observation   .
-PRON- be indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the result in the context of previously publish scientific research   .
therefore   ,   proper citation be include in this section as well   .
finally   ,   the conclusion section summarize the importance of the experimental finding   .
while the scientific paper almost certainly answer one or more scientific question that be state   ,   any good research should lead to more question   .
therefore   ,   a well   -   do scientific paper leave door open for the researcher and other to continue and expand on the finding   .
review article do not follow the imrad format because -PRON- do not present original scientific finding   ,   or primary literature    instead   ,   -PRON- summarize and comment on finding that be publish as primary literature and typically include extensive reference section   .   response   ,   but -PRON- be not always easy to define life   .
for example   ,   a branch of biology call virology study virus   ,   which exhibit some of the characteristic of living entity but lack other   .
-PRON- turn out that although virus can attack live organism   ,   because disease   ,   and even reproduce   ,   -PRON- do not meet the criterion that biologist use to define life   .
consequently   ,   virologist be not biologist   ,   strictly speak   .
similarly   ,   some biologist study the early molecular evolution that give rise to life    since the event that precede life be not biological event   ,   these scientist be also exclude from biology in the strict sense of the term   .
from -PRON- early beginning   ,   biology have wrestle with three question    what be the share property that make something " alive "   ?
and once -PRON- know something be alive   ,   how do -PRON- find meaningful level of organization in -PRON- structure   ?
and   ,   finally   ,   when face with the remarkable diversity of life   ,   how do -PRON- organize the different kind of organism so that -PRON- can better understand -PRON-   ?
as new organism be discover every day   ,   biologist continue to seek answer to these and other question   .
property of life all live organism share several key characteristic or function    order   ,   sensitivity or response to the environment   ,   reproduction   ,   adaptation   ,   growth and development   ,   regulation   ,   homeostasis   ,   energy processing   ,   and evolution   .
when view together   ,   these nine characteristic serve to define life   .
organism be highly organize   ,   coordinate structure that consist of one or more cell   .
even very simple   ,   single   -   cell organism be remarkably complex    inside each cell   ,   atom make up molecule    these in turn make up cell organelle and other cellular inclusion   .
in multicellular organism   (   figure   one    .    one   zero    )    ,   similar cell form tissue   .
tissue   ,   in turn   ,   collaborate to create organ   (   body structure with a distinct function   )    .   organ work together to form organ system   .
figure   one    .    one   one   the leaf of this sensitive plant   (   mimosa pudica   )   will instantly droop and fold when touch   .
after a few minute   ,   the plant return to normal   .    (   credit    alex loma   )   organism respond to diverse stimulus   .
for example   ,   plant can bend toward a source of light   ,   climb on fence and wall   ,   or respond to touch   (   figure   one    .    one   one    )    .   even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemical   (   a process call chemotaxis   )   or light   (   phototaxi   )    .   movement toward a stimulus be consider a positive response   ,   while movement away from a stimulus be consider a negative response   .
reproduction single   -   cell organism reproduce by first duplicate -PRON- dna   ,   and then divide -PRON- equally as the cell prepare to divide to form two new cell   .
multicellular organism often produce specialize reproductive germline cell that will form new individual   .
when reproduction occur   ,   gene contain dna be pass along to an organism ' s offspring   .
these gene ensure that the offspring will belong to the same specie and will have similar characteristic   ,   such as size and shape   .
growth and development organism grow and develop follow specific instruction cod for by -PRON- gene   .
these gene provide instruction that will direct cellular growth and development   ,   ensure that a specie ’ young   (   figure   one    .    one   two    )   will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristic as -PRON- parent   .

(   credit    rocky mountain feline rescue   )   regulation even the small organism be complex and require multiple regulatory mechanism to coordinate internal function   ,   respond to stimulus   ,   and cope with environmental stress   .
two example of internal function regulate in an organism be nutrient transport and blood flow   .
organ   (   group of tissue work together   )   perform specific function   ,   such as carry oxygen throughout the body   ,   remove waste   ,   deliver nutrient to every cell   ,   and cool the body   .
figure   one    .    one   three   polar bear   (   ursus maritimus   )   and other mammal live in ice   -   cover region maintain -PRON- body temperature by generate heat and reduce heat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under -PRON- skin   .    (   credit    " longhorndave "   /   flickr   )   in order to function properly   ,   cell need to have appropriate condition such as proper temperature   ,   ph   ,   and appropriate concentration of diverse chemical   .
these condition may   ,   however   ,   change from one moment to the next   .
organism be able to maintain internal condition within a narrow range almost constantly   ,   despite environmental change   ,   through homeostasis   (   literally   ,   " steady state "   )   -- the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal condition   .
for example   ,   an organism need to regulate body temperature through a process know as thermoregulation   .
organism that live in cold climate   ,   such as the polar bear   (   figure   one    .    one   three    )    ,   have body structure that help -PRON- withstand low temperature and conserve body heat   .
structure that aid in this type of insulation include fur   ,   feather   ,   blubber   ,   and fat   .
in hot climate   ,   figure   one    .    one   four   the california condor   (   gymnogyps californianus   )   use chemical energy derive from food to power flight   .
california condor be an endanger species    this bird have a wing tag that help biologist identify the individual   .    (   credit    pacific southwest region u   .   s   .   fish and wildlife service   )   all organism use a source of energy for -PRON- metabolic activity   .
some organism capture energy from the sun and convert -PRON- into chemical energy in food    other use chemical energy in molecule -PRON- take in as food   (   figure   one    .    one   four    )    .   level of organization of live thing live thing be highly organized and structured   ,   follow a hierarchy that can be examine on a scale from small to large   .
the atom be the small and most fundamental unit of matter   .
-PRON- consist of a nucleus surround by electron   .
atom form molecule   .
a molecule be a chemical structure consist of at least two atom hold together by one or more chemical bond   .
many molecule that be biologically important be macromolecule   ,   large molecule that be typically form by polymerization   (   a polymer be a large molecule that be make by combine small unit call monomer   ,   which be simple than macromolecule   )    .   an example of a macromolecule be deoxyribonucleic acid   (   dna   )    (   figure   one    .    one   five    )    ,   which contain the instruction for the structure and functioning of all live organism   .
some cell contain aggregate of macromolecule surround by membrane    these be call organelle   .
organelle be small structure that exist within cell   .
example of organelle include mitochondria and chloroplast   ,   which carry out indispensable function    mitochondria produce energy to power the cell   ,   while chloroplast enable green plant to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugar   .
all live thing be make of cell    the cell -PRON- be the small fundamental unit of structure and function in live organism   .    (   this requirement be why virus be not consider live    -PRON- be not make of cell   .
to make new virus   ,   -PRON- have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a live cell    only then can -PRON- obtain the material -PRON- need to reproduce   .    )   some organism consist of a single cell and other be multicellular   .
cell be classify as prokaryotic or eukaryotic   .
prokaryote be single   -   cell or colonial organism that do not have membranebound nucleus    in contrast   ,   the cell of eukaryote do have membrane   -   bind organelle and a membrane   -   bind nucleus   .
in large organism   ,   cell combine to make tissue   ,   which be group of similar cell carry out similar or related function   .
organ be collection of tissue group together perform a common function   .
organ be present not only in animal but also in plant   .
an organ system be a high level of organization that consist of functionally relate organ   .
mammal have many organ system   .
for instance   ,   the circulatory system transport blood through the body and to and from the lung    -PRON- include organ such as the heart and blood vessel   .
organism be individual living entity   .
for example   ,   each tree in a forest be an organism   .
single   -   cell prokaryote and single   -   cell eukaryote be also consider organism and be typically refer to as microorganism   .
all the individual of a specie live within a specific area be collectively call a population   .
for example   ,   a forest may include many pine tree   .
all of these pine tree represent the population of pine tree in this forest   .
different population may live in the same specific area   .
for example   ,   the forest with the pine tree include population of flower plant and also insect and microbial population   .
a community be the sum of population inhabit a particular area   .
for instance   ,   all of the tree   ,   flower   ,   insect   ,   and other population in a forest form the forest ' s community   .
the forest -PRON- be an ecosystem   .
an ecosystem consist of all the live thing in a particular area together with the abiotic   ,   non   -   live part of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water   .
at the high level of organization   (   figure   one    .    one   six    )    ,   the biosphere be the collection of all ecosystem   ,   and -PRON- represent the zone of life on earth   .
-PRON- include land   ,   water   ,   and even the atmosphere to a certain extent   .
the biological level of organization of live thing be show   .
from a single organelle to the entire biosphere   ,   live organism be part of a highly structured hierarchy   .

the source of this diversity be evolution   ,   the process of gradual change during which new specie arise from old specie   .
evolutionary biologist study the evolution of live thing in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystem   .
the evolution of various life form on earth can be summarize in a phylogenetic tree   (   figure   one    .    one   seven    )    .   a phylogenetic tree be a diagram show the evolutionary relationship among biological specie base on similarity and difference in genetic or physical trait or both   .
a phylogenetic tree be compose of node and branch   .
the internal node represent ancestor and be point in evolution when   ,   base on scientific evidence   ,   an ancestor be think to have diverge to form two new specie   .
the length of each branch be proportional to the time elapse since the split   .
this phylogenetic tree be construct by microbiologist carl woese use datum obtain from sequence ribosomal rna gene   .
the tree show the separation of live organism into three domain    bacteria   ,   archaea   ,   and eukarya   .
bacteria and archaea be prokaryote   ,   single   -   cell organism lack intracellular organelle   .    (   credit    eric gaba    nasa astrobiology institute   )   carl woese and the phylogenetic tree in the past   ,   biologist group live organism into five kingdom    animal   ,   plant   ,   fungus   ,   protist   ,   and bacteria   .
the organizational scheme be base mainly on physical feature   ,   as oppose to physiology   ,   biochemistry   ,   or molecular biology   ,   all of which be use by modern systematic   .
the pioneering work of american microbiologist carl woese in the early   one   nine   seven   zero s have show   ,   however   ,   that life on earth have evolve along three lineage   ,   now call domain -- bacteria   ,   archaea   ,   and eukarya   .
the first two be prokaryotic cell with microbe that lack membrane   -   enclose nucleus and organell   .
the third domain contain the eukaryote and include unicellular microorganism together with the four original kingdom   (   exclude bacteria   )    .   woese define archaea as a new domain   ,   and this result in a new taxonomic tree   (   figure   one    .    one   seven    )    .   many organism belong to the archaea domain live under extreme condition and be call extremophile   .
to construct -PRON- tree   ,   woese use genetic relationship rather than similarity base on morphology   (   shape   )    .   woese ' s tree be construct from comparative sequencing of the gene that be universally distribute   ,   present in every organism   ,   and conserve   (   mean that these gene have remain essentially unchanged throughout evolution   )    .   woese ' s approach be revolutionary because comparison of physical feature be insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryote that appear fairly similar in spite of -PRON- tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability   (   figure   one    .    one   eight    )    .   the comparison of homologous dna and rna sequence provide woese with a sensitive device that reveal the extensive variability of prokaryote   ,   and which justify the separation of the prokaryote into two domain    bacteria and archaea   .
these image represent different domain   .
the   (   a   )   bacteria in this micrograph belong to domain bacteria   ,   while the   (   b   )   extremophile   (   not visible   )   live in this hot vent belong to domain archaea   .
both the   (   c   )   sunflower and   (   d   )   lion be part of domain eukarya   .    (   credit a    modification of work by drew march    credit b    modification of work by steve jurvetson    credit c    modification of work by michael arrighi    credit d    modification of work by leszek leszcynski   )   branch of biological study the scope of biology be broad and therefore contain many branch and subdiscipline   .
biologist may pursue one of those subdiscipline and work in a more focused field   .
for instance   ,   molecular biology and biochemistry study biological process at the molecular and chemical level   ,   include interaction among molecule such as dna   ,   rna   ,   and protein   ,   as well as the way -PRON- be regulate   .
microbiology   ,   the study of microorganism   ,   be the study of the structure and function of single   -   cell organism   .
-PRON- be quite a broad branch -PRON-   ,   and depend on the subject of study   ,   there be also microbial physiologist   ,   ecologist   ,   and geneticist   ,   among other   .
forensic science be the application of science to answer question relate to the law   .
biologist as well as chemist and biochemist can be forensic scientist   .
forensic scientist provide scientific evidence for use in court   ,   and -PRON- job involve examine trace material associate with crime   .
interest in forensic science have increase in the last few year   ,   possibly because of popular television show that feature forensic scientist on the job   .
also   ,   the development of molecular technique and the establishment of dna database have expand the type of work that forensic scientist can do   .
-PRON- job activity be primarily relate to crime against people such as murder   ,   rape   ,   and assault   .
-PRON- work involve analyze sample such as hair   ,   blood   ,   and other body fluid and also process dna   (   figure   one    .    one   nine    )   find in many different environment and material   .
forensic scientist also analyze other biological evidence leave at crime scene   ,   such as insect larvae or pollen grain   .
student who want to pursue career in forensic science will most likely be require to take chemistry and biology course as well as some intensive math course   .
another field of biological study   ,   neurobiology   ,   study the biology of the nervous system   ,   and although -PRON- be consider a branch of biology   ,   -PRON- be also recognize as an interdisciplinary field of study know as neuroscience   .
because of -PRON- interdisciplinary nature   ,   this subdiscipline study different function of the nervous system use molecular   ,   cellular   ,   developmental   ,   medical   ,   and computational approach   .
paleontology   ,   another branch of biology   ,   use fossil to study life ' s history   (   figure   one    .    two   zero    )    .   zoology and botany be the study of animal and plant   ,   respectively   .
biologist can also specialize as biotechnologist   ,   ecologist   ,   or physiologist   ,   to name just a few area   .
this be just a small sample of the many field that biologist can pursue   .
biology be the culmination of the achievement of the natural science from -PRON- inception to today   .
excitingly   ,   -PRON- be the cradle of emerge science   ,   such as the biology of brain activity   ,   genetic engineering of custom organism   ,   and the biology of evolution that use the laboratory tool of molecular biology to retrace the early stage of life on earth   .
a scan of news headline -- whether report on immunization   ,   a newly discover specie   ,   sport doping   ,   or a genetically   -   modify food -- demonstrate the way biology be active in and important to -PRON- everyday world   .
atom be the building block of molecule find in the universe -- air   ,   soil   ,   water   ,   rock   .    .    .   and also the cell of all live organism   .
in this model of an organic molecule   ,   the atom of carbon   (   black   )    ,   hydrogen   (   white   )    ,   nitrogen   (   blue   )    ,   oxygen   (   red   )    ,   and sulfur   (   yellow   )   be show in proportional atomic size   .
the silver rod indicate chemical bond   .
element in various combination comprise all matter   ,   include live thing   .
some of the most abundant element in live organism include carbon   ,   hydrogen   ,   nitrogen   ,   oxygen   ,   sulfur   ,   and phosphorus   .
these form the nucleic acid   ,   protein   ,   carbohydrate   ,   and lipid that be the fundamental component of living matter   .
biologist must understand these important building block and the unique structure of the atom that make up molecule   ,   allow for the formation of cell   ,   tissue   ,   organ system   ,   and entire organism   .
all biological process follow the law of physics and chemistry   ,   so in order to understand how biological system work   ,   -PRON- be important to understand the underlie physics and chemistry   .
for example   ,   the flow of blood within the circulatory system follow the law of physics that regulate the mode of fluid flow   .
the breakdown of the large   ,   complex molecule of food into small molecule -- and the conversion of these to release energy to be store in adenosine triphosphate   (   atp   )   -- be a series of chemical reaction that follow chemical law   .
the property of water and the formation of hydrogen bond be key to understand living process   .
recognize the property of acid and base be important   ,   for example   ,   to -PRON- understanding of the digestive process   .
therefore   ,   the fundamental of physics and chemistry be important for gain insight into biological process   .
at -PRON- most fundamental level   ,   life be make up of matter   .
matter be any substance that occupy space and have mass   .
element be unique form of matter with specific chemical and physical property that can not be break down into small substance by ordinary chemical reaction   .
there be   one   one   eight   element   ,   but only   nine   two   occur naturally   .
the remain element be synthesize in laboratory and be unstable   .
each element be designate by -PRON- chemical symbol   ,   which be a single capital letter or   ,   when the first letter be already " take " by another element   ,   a combination of two letter   .
some element follow the english term for the element   ,   such as c for carbon and ca for calcium   .
other element ’ chemical symbol derive from -PRON- latin name    for example   ,   the symbol for sodium be na   ,   refer to natrium   ,   the latin word for sodium   .
the four element common to all live organism be oxygen   (   o   )    ,   carbon   (   c   )    ,   hydrogen   (   h   )    ,   and nitrogen   (   n   )    .   in the nonliv world   ,   element be find in different proportion   ,   and some element common to live organism be relatively rare on the earth as a whole   ,   as show in table   two    .    one    .   for example   ,   the atmosphere be rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contain little carbon and hydrogen   ,   while the earth ' s crust   ,   although -PRON- contain oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen   ,   have little nitrogen and carbon   .
in spite of -PRON- difference in abundance   ,   all element and the chemical reaction between -PRON- obey the same chemical and physical law regardless of whether -PRON- be a part of the living or non   -   live world   .
to understand how element come together   ,   -PRON- must first discuss the small component or building block of an element   ,   the atom   .
an atom be the small unit of matter that retain all of the chemical property of an element   .
for example   ,   one gold atom have all of the property of gold in that -PRON- be a solid metal at room temperature   .
a gold coin be simply a very large number of gold atom mold into the shape of a coin and contain small amount of other element know as impurity   .
gold atom can not be break down into anything small while still retain the property of gold   .
an atom be compose of two region    the nucleus   ,   which be in the center of the atom and contain proton and neutron   ,   and the outermost region of the atom which hold -PRON- electron in orbit around the nucleus   ,   as illustrate in figure   two    .    two    .   atom contain proton   ,   electron   ,   and neutron   ,   among other subatomic particle   .
the only exception be hydrogen   (   h   )    ,   which be make of one proton and one electron with no neutron   .
element   ,   such as helium   ,   depict here   ,   be make up of atom   .
atom be make up of proton and neutron locate within the nucleus   ,   with electron in orbital surround the nucleus   .
proton and neutron have approximately the same mass   ,   about   one    .    six   seven   å ~   one   zero    -    two   four   gram   .
scientist arbitrarily define this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit   (   amu   )   or one dalton   ,   as show in table   two    .    two    .   although similar in mass   ,   proton and neutron differ in -PRON- electric charge   .
a proton be positively charge whereas a neutron be uncharged   .
therefore   ,   the number of neutron in an atom contribute significantly to -PRON- mass   ,   but not to -PRON- charge   .
electron be much small in mass than proton   ,   weigh only   nine    .    one   one   å ~   one   zero    -    two   eight   gram   ,   or about   one    /    one   eight   zero   zero   of an atomic mass unit   .
hence   ,   -PRON- do not contribute much to an element ' s overall atomic mass   .
therefore   ,   when consider atomic mass   ,   -PRON- be customary to ignore the mass of any electron and calculate the atom ' s mass base on the number of proton and neutron alone   .
although not significant contributor to mass   ,   electron do contribute greatly to the atom ' s charge   ,   as each electron have a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton   .
in uncharged   ,   neutral atom   ,   the number of electron orbit the nucleus be equal to the number of proton inside the nucleus   .
in these atom   ,   the positive and negative charge cancel each other out   ,   lead to an atom with no net charge   .
account for the size of proton   ,   neutron   ,   and electron   ,   most of the volume of an atom -- great than   nine   nine   percent -- be   ,   in fact   ,   empty space   .
with all this empty space   ,   one may ask why so   -   call solid object do not just pass through one another   .
the reason -PRON- do not be that the electron that surround all atom be negatively charge and negative charge repel each other   .
atom of each element contain a characteristic number of proton and electron   .
the number of proton determine an element ' s atomic number and be use to distinguish one element from another   .
the number of neutron be variable   ,   result in isotope   ,   which be different form of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutron -PRON- possess   .
together   ,   the number of proton and the number of neutron determine an element ' s mass number   ,   as illustrate in figure   two    .    three    .   note that the small contribution of mass from electron be disregard in calculate the mass number   .
this approximation of mass can be use to easily calculate how many neutron an element have by simply subtract the number of proton from the mass number   .
since an element ' s isotope will have slightly different mass number   ,   scientist also determine the atomic mass   ,   which be the calculated mean of the mass number for -PRON- naturally occur isotope   .
often   ,   the result number contain a fraction   .
for example   ,   the atomic mass of chlorine   (   cl   )   be   three   five    .    four   five   because chlorine be compose of several isotope   ,   some   (   the majority   )   with atomic mass   three   five    (    one   seven   proton and   one   eight   neutron   )   and some with atomic mass   three   seven    (    one   seven   proton and   two   zero   neutron   )    .   isotope be different form of an element that have the same number of proton but a different number of neutron   .
some element -- such as carbon   ,   potassium   ,   and uranium -- have naturally occur isotope   .
carbon   -    one   two   contain six proton   ,   six neutron   ,   and six electron    therefore   ,   -PRON- have a mass number of   one   two    (   six proton and six neutron   )    .   carbon   -    one   four   contain six proton   ,   eight neutron   ,   and six electron    -PRON- atomic mass be   one   four    (   six proton and eight neutron   )    .   these two alternate form of carbon be isotope   .
some isotope may emit neutron   ,   proton   ,   and electron   ,   and attain a more stable atomic configuration   (   low level of potential energy   )     these be radioactive isotope   ,   or radioisotope   .
radioactive decay   (   carbon   -    one   four   lose neutron to eventually become carbon   -    one   two    )   describe the energy loss that occur when an unstable atom ' s nucleus release radiation   .
carbon be normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compound like carbon dioxide and methane   .
carbon   -    one   four    (    one   four c   )   be a naturally occur radioisotope that be create in the atmosphere from atmospheric   one   four n   (   nitrogen   )   by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic ray   .
this be a continuous process   ,   so more   one   four c be always be create   .
as a live organism incorporate   one   four c initially as carbon dioxide fix in the process of photosynthesis   ,   the relative amount of   one   four c in -PRON- body be equal to the concentration of   one   four c in the atmosphere   .
when an organism die   ,   -PRON- be no longer ingest   one   four c   ,   so the ratio between   one   four c and   one   two c will decline as   one   four c decay gradually to   one   four n by a process call beta decay -- the emission of electron or positron   .
this decay give off energy in a slow process   .
after approximately   five    ,    seven   three   zero   year   ,   half of the start concentration of   one   four c will have be convert back to   one   four n   .
the time -PRON- take for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to -PRON- more stable form be call -PRON- half   -   life   .
because the half   -   life of   one   four c be long   ,   -PRON- be use to date formerly live object such as old bone or wood   .
compare the ratio of the   one   four c concentration find in an object to the amount of   one   four c detect in the atmosphere   ,   the amount of the isotope that have not yet decay can be determine   .
on the basis of this amount   ,   the age of the material   ,   such as the pygmy mammoth show in figure   two    .    four    ,   can be calculate with accuracy if -PRON- be not much old than about   five   zero    ,    zero   zero   zero   year   .
other element have isotope with different half life   .
for example   ,    four   zero k   (   potassium   -    four   zero    )   have a half   -   life of   one    .    two   five   billion year   ,   and   two   three   five u   (   uranium   two   three   five    )   have a half   -   life of about   seven   zero   zero   million year   .
through the use of radiometric date   ,   scientist can study the age of fossil or other remain of extinct organism to understand how organism have evolve from early specie   .
the age of carbon   -   contain remain less than about   five   zero    ,    zero   zero   zero   year old   ,   such as this pygmy mammoth   ,   can be determine use carbon date   .
the different element be organize and display in the periodic table   .
devise by russian chemist dmitri mendeleev   (    one   eight   three   four   –   one   nine   zero   seven    )   in   one   eight   six   nine    ,   the table group element that   ,   although unique   ,   share certain chemical property with other element   .
the property of element be responsible for -PRON- physical state at room temperature    -PRON- may be gas   ,   solid   ,   or liquid   .
element also have specific chemical reactivity   ,   the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other   .
in the periodic table   ,   show in figure   two    .    five    ,   the element be organize and display accord to -PRON- atomic number and be arrange in a series of row and column base on share chemical and physical property   .
in addition to provide the atomic number for each element   ,   the periodic table also display the element ' s atomic mass   .
look at carbon   ,   for example   ,   -PRON- symbol   (   c   )   and name appear   ,   as well as -PRON- atomic number of six   (   in the upper left   -   hand corner   )   and -PRON- atomic mass of   one   two    .    one   one    .   the periodic table show the atomic mass and atomic number of each element   .
the atomic number appear above the symbol for the element and the approximate atomic mass appear below -PRON-   .
the periodic table group element accord to chemical property   .
the difference in chemical reactivity between the element be base on the number and spatial distribution of an atom ' s electron   .
atom that chemically react and bond to each other form molecule   .
molecule be simply two or more atom chemically bond together   .
logically   ,   when two atom chemically bond to form a molecule   ,   -PRON- electron   ,   which form the outermost region of each atom   ,   come together first as the atom form a chemical bond   .
-PRON- should be stress that there be a connection between the number of proton in an element   ,   the atomic number that distinguish one element from another   ,   and the number of electron -PRON- have   .
in all electrically neutral atom   ,   the number of electron be the same as the number of proton   .
thus   ,   each element   ,   at least when electrically neutral   ,   have a characteristic number of electron equal to -PRON- atomic number   .
an early model of the atom be develop in   one   nine   one   three   by danish scientist niel bohr   (    one   eight   eight   five   –   one   nine   six   two    )    .   the bohr model show the atom as a central nucleus contain proton and neutron   ,   with the electron in circular orbital at specific distance from the nucleus   ,   as illustrate in figure   two    .    six    .   these orbit form electron shell or energy level   ,   which be a way of visualize the number of electron in the outermost shell   .
these energy level be designate by a number and the symbol " n   .   " for example   ,    one n represent the first energy level locate close to the nucleus   .
the bohr model be develop by niel bohr in   one   nine   one   three    .
in this model   ,   electron exist within principal shell   .
an electron normally exist in the low energy shell available   ,   which be the one close to the nucleus   .
energy from a photon of light can bump -PRON- up to a high energy shell   ,   but this situation be unstable   ,   and the electron quickly decay back to the ground state   .
in the process   ,   a photon of light be release   .
electron fill orbital in a consistent order    -PRON- first fill the orbital close to the nucleus   ,   then -PRON- continue to fill orbital of increase energy further from the nucleus   .
if there be multiple orbital of equal energy   ,   -PRON- will be fill with one electron in each energy level before a second electron be add   .
the electron of the outermost energy level determine the energetic stability of the atom and -PRON- tendency to form chemical bond with other atom to form molecule   .
under standard condition   ,   atom fill the inner shell first   ,   often result in a variable number of electron in the outermost shell   .
the innermost shell have a maximum of two electron but the next two electron shell can each have a maximum of eight electron   .
this be know as the octet rule   ,   which state   ,   with the exception of the innermost shell   ,   that atom be more stable energetically when -PRON- have eight electron in -PRON- valence shell   ,   the outermost electron shell   .
example of some neutral atom and -PRON- electron configuration be show in figure   two    .    seven    .   notice that in this figure   two    .    seven    ,   helium have a complete outer electron shell   ,   with two electron fill -PRON- first and only shell   .
similarly   ,   neon have a complete outer   two n shell contain eight electron   .
in contrast   ,   chlorine and sodium have seven and one in -PRON- outer shell   ,   respectively   ,   but theoretically -PRON- would be more energetically stable if -PRON- follow the octet rule and have eight   .
bohr diagram indicate how many electron fill each principal shell   .
group   one   eight   element   (   helium   ,   neon   ,   and argon be show   )   have a full outer   ,   or valence   ,   shell   .
a full valence shell be the most stable electron configuration   .
element in other group have partially fill valence shell and gain or lose electron to achieve a stable electron configuration   .
an atom may give   ,   take   ,   or share electron with another atom to achieve a full valence shell   ,   the most stable electron configuration   .
look at this figure   ,   how many electron do element in group   one   need to lose in order to achieve a stable electron configuration   ?
how many electron do element in group   one   four   and   one   seven   need to gain to achieve a stable configuration   ?
understand that the organization of the periodic table be base on the total number of proton   (   and electron   )   help -PRON- know how electron be distribute among the outer shell   .
the periodic table be arrange in column and row base on the number of electron and where these electron be locate   .
take a close look at the some of the element in the table ' s far right column in figure   two    .    five    .   the group   one   eight   atom helium   (   -PRON-   )    ,   neon   (   ne   )    ,   and argon   (   ar   )   all have fill outer electron shell   ,   make -PRON- unnecessary for -PRON- to share electron with other atom to attain stability    -PRON- be highly stable as single atom   .
-PRON- non   -   reactivity have result in -PRON- be name the inert gas   (   or noble gas   )    .   compare this to the group   one   element in the left   -   hand column   .
these element   ,   include hydrogen   (   h   )    ,   lithium   (   li   )    ,   and sodium   (   na   )    ,   all have one electron in -PRON- outermost shell   .
that mean that -PRON- can achieve a stable configuration and a fill outer shell by donate or share one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water   .
hydrogen will donate or share -PRON- electron to achieve this configuration   ,   while lithium and sodium will donate -PRON- electron to become stable   .
as a result of lose a negatively charge electron   ,   -PRON- become positively charge ion   .
group   one   seven   element   ,   include fluorine and chlorine   ,   have seven electron in -PRON- outmost shell   ,   so -PRON- tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atom or molecule   ,   make -PRON- negatively charge ion   .
group   one   four   element   ,   of which carbon be the most important to live system   ,   have four electron in -PRON- outer shell allow -PRON- to make several covalent bond   (   discuss below   )   with other atom   .
thus   ,   the column of the periodic table represent the potential share state of these element ’ outer electron shell that be responsible for -PRON- similar chemical characteristic   .
although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain element   ,   the bohr model of the atom do not accurately reflect how electron be spatially distribute surround the nucleus   .
-PRON- do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbit the sun   ,   but be find in electron orbital   .
these relatively complex shape result from the fact that electron behave not just like particle   ,   but also like wave   .
mathematical equation from quantum mechanic know as wave function can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron may be at any give time   .
the area where an electron be most likely to be find be call -PRON- orbital   .
recall that the bohr model depict an atom ' s electron shell configuration   .
within each electron shell be subshell   ,   and each subshell have a specify number of orbital contain electron   .
while -PRON- be impossible to calculate exactly where an electron be locate   ,   scientist know that -PRON- be most probably locate within -PRON- orbital path   .
subshell be designate by the letter s   ,   p   ,   d   ,   and f   .   the s subshell be spherical in shape and have one orbital   .
principal shell   one n have only a single s orbital   ,   which can hold two electron   .
principal shell   two n have one s and one p subshell   ,   and can hold a total of eight electron   .
the p subshell have three dumbbell   -   shape orbital   ,   as illustrate in figure   two    .    eight    .   subshell d and f have more complex shape and contain five and seven orbital   ,   respectively   .
these be not show in the illustration   .
principal shell   three n have s   ,   p   ,   and d subshell and can hold   one   eight   electron   .
principal shell   four n have s   ,   p   ,   d and f orbital and can hold   three   two   electron   .
move away from the nucleus   ,   the number of electron and orbital find in the energy level increase   .
progress from one atom to the next in the periodic table   ,   the electron structure can be work out by fit an extra electron into the next available orbital   .
the s subshell be shape like sphere   .
both the   one n and   two n principal shell have an s orbital   ,   but the size of the sphere be large in the   two n orbital   .
each sphere be a single orbital   .   p subshell be make up of three dumbbellshap orbital   .
principal shell   two n have a p subshell   ,   but shell   one   do not   .
the close orbital to the nucleus   ,   call the   one s orbital   ,   can hold up to two electron   .
this orbital be equivalent to the innermost electron shell of the bohr model of the atom   .
-PRON- be call the   one s orbital because -PRON- be spherical around the nucleus   .
the   one s orbital be the close orbital to the nucleus   ,   and -PRON- be always fill first   ,   before any other orbital can be fill   .
hydrogen have one electron    therefore   ,   -PRON- have only one spot within the   one s orbital occupy   .
this be designate as   one s one    ,   where the superscript   one   refer to the one electron within the   one s orbital   .
helium have two electron    therefore   ,   -PRON- can completely fill the   one s orbital with -PRON- two electron   .
this be designate as   one s two    ,   refer to the two electron of helium in the   one s orbital   .
on the periodic table figure   two    .    five    ,   hydrogen and helium be the only two element in the first row   (   period   )     this be because -PRON- only have electron in -PRON- first shell   ,   the   one s orbital   .
hydrogen and helium be the only two element that have the   one s and no other electron orbital in the electrically neutral state   .
the second electron shell may contain eight electron   .
this shell contain another spherical s orbital and three " dumbbell " shape p orbital   ,   each of which can hold two electron   ,   as show in figure   two    .    eight    .   after the   one s orbital be fill   ,   the second electron shell be fill   ,   first fill -PRON-   two s orbital and then -PRON- three p orbital   .
when fill the p orbital   ,   each take a single electron    once each p orbital have an electron   ,   a second may be add   .
lithium   (   li   )   contain three electron that occupy the first and second shell   .
two electron fill the   one s orbital   ,   and the third electron then fill the   two s orbital   .
-PRON- electron configuration be   one s two   two s one    .
neon   (   ne   )    ,   on the other hand   ,   have a total of ten electron    two be in -PRON- innermost   one s orbital and eight fill -PRON- second shell   (   two each in the   two s and three p orbital   )     thus   ,   -PRON- be an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atom   .
large element have additional orbital   ,   make up the third electron shell   .
while the concept of electron shell and orbital be closely related   ,   orbital provide a more accurate depiction of the electron configuration of an atom because the orbital model specify the different shape and special orientation of all the place that electron may occupy   .
all element be most stable when -PRON- outermost shell be fill with electron accord to the octet rule   .
this be because -PRON- be energetically favorable for atom to be in that configuration and -PRON- make -PRON- stable   .
however   ,   since not all element have enough electron to fill -PRON- outermost shell   ,   atom form chemical bond with other atom thereby obtain the electron -PRON- need to attain a stable electron configuration   .
when two or more atom chemically bond with each other   ,   the resultant chemical structure be a molecule   .
the familiar water molecule   ,   h two o   ,   consist of two hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom    these bond together to form water   ,   as illustrate in figure   two    .    nine    .   atom can form molecule by donate   ,   accept   ,   or share electron to fill -PRON- outer shell   .
two or more atom may bond with each other to form a molecule   .
when two hydrogen and an oxygen share electron via covalent bond   ,   a water molecule be form   .
chemical reaction occur when two or more atom bond together to form molecule or when bond atom be break apart   .
the substance use in the beginning of a chemical reaction be call the reactant   (   usually find on the left side of a chemical equation   )    ,   and the substance find at the end of the reaction be know as the product   (   usually find on the right side of a chemical equation   )    .   an arrow be typically draw between the reactant and product to indicate the direction of the chemical reaction    this direction be not always a " one   -   way street   .
" for the creation of the water molecule show above   ,   the chemical equation would be    an example of a simple chemical reaction be the break down of hydrogen peroxide molecule   ,   each of which consist of two hydrogen atom bond to two oxygen atom   (   h two o two    )    .   the reactant hydrogen peroxide be break down into water   ,   contain one oxygen atom bind to two hydrogen atom   (   h two o   )    ,   and oxygen   ,   which consist of two bond oxygen atom   (   o two    )    .   in the equation below   ,   the reaction include two hydrogen peroxide molecule and two water molecule   .
this be an example of a balanced chemical equation   ,   wherein the number of atom of each element be the same on each side of the equation   .
accord to the law of conservation of matter   ,   the number of atom before and after a chemical reaction should be equal   ,   such that no atom be   ,   under normal circumstance   ,   create or destroy   .
even though all of the reactant and product of this reaction be molecule   (   each atom remain bond to at least one other atom   )    ,   in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water be representative of compound    -PRON- contain atom of more than one type of element   .
molecular oxygen   ,   on the other hand   ,   as show in figure   two    .    one   zero    ,   consist of two doubly bond oxygen atom and be not classify as a compound but as a mononuclear molecule   .
the oxygen atom in an o two   molecule be join by a double bond   .
some chemical reaction   ,   such as the one show above   ,   can proceed in one direction until the reactant be all use up   .
the equation that describe these reaction contain a unidirectional arrow and be irreversible   .
reversible reaction be those that can go in either direction   .
in reversible reaction   ,   reactant be turn into product   ,   but when the concentration of product go beyond a certain threshold   (   characteristic of the particular reaction   )    ,   some of these product will be convert back into reactant    at this point   ,   the designation of product and reactant be reverse   .
this back and forth continue until a certain relative balance between reactant and product occur -- a state call equilibrium   .
these situation of reversible reaction be often denote by a chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactant and product   .
for example   ,   in human blood   ,   excess hydrogen ion   (   h +   )   bind to bicarbonate ion   (   hco three    -    )   form an equilibrium state with carbonic acid   (   h two co three    )    .   if carbonic acid be add to this system   ,   some of -PRON- would be convert to bicarbonate and hydrogen ion   .
in biological reaction   ,   however   ,   equilibrium be rarely obtain because the concentration of the reactant or product or both be constantly change   ,   often with a product of one reaction be a reactant for another   .
to return to the example of excess hydrogen ion in the blood   ,   the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction   .
however   ,   the carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas   (   via exhalation   )   instead of be convert back to bicarbonate ion   ,   thus drive the reaction to the right by the chemical law know as law of mass action   .
these reaction be important for maintain the homeostasis of -PRON- blood   .
some atom be more stable when -PRON- gain or lose an electron   (   or possibly two   )   and form ion   .
this fill -PRON- outermost electron shell and make -PRON- energetically more stable   .
because the number of electron do not equal the number of proton   ,   each ion have a net charge   .
cation be positive ion that be form by lose electron   .
negative ion be form by gain electron and be call anion   .
anion be designate by -PRON- elemental name be alter to end in "   -   ide "    the anion of chlorine be call chloride   ,   and the anion of sulfur be call sulfide   ,   for example   .
this movement of electron from one element to another be refer to as electron transfer   .
as figure   two    .    one   one   illustrate   ,   sodium   (   na   )   only have one electron in -PRON- outer electron shell   .
-PRON- take less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than -PRON- do to accept seven more electron to fill the outer shell   .
if sodium lose an electron   ,   -PRON- now have   one   one   proton   ,    one   one   neutron   ,   and only   one   zero   electron   ,   leave -PRON- with an overall charge of +   one    .   -PRON- be now refer to as a sodium ion   .
chlorine   (   cl   )   in -PRON- low energy state   (   call the ground state   )   have seven electron in -PRON- outer shell   .
again   ,   -PRON- be more energy   -   efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven   .
therefore   ,   -PRON- tend to gain an electron to create an ion with   one   seven   proton   ,    one   seven   neutron   ,   and   one   eight   electron   ,   give -PRON- a net negative   (   –   one    )   charge   .
-PRON- be now refer to as a chloride ion   .
in this example   ,   sodium will donate -PRON- one electron to empty -PRON- shell   ,   and chlorine will accept that electron to fill -PRON- shell   .
both ion now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shell   .
because the number of electron be no longer equal to the number of proton   ,   each be now an ion and have a +   one    (   sodium cation   )   or –   one    (   chloride anion   )   charge   .
note that these transaction can normally only take place simultaneously    in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron   ,   -PRON- must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom   .
in the formation of an ionic compound   ,   metal lose electron and nonmetal gain electron to achieve an octet   .
ionic bond be form between ion with opposite charge   .
for instance   ,   positively charge sodium ion and negatively charge chloride ion bond together to make crystal of sodium chloride   ,   or table salt   ,   create a crystalline molecule with zero net charge   .
certain salt be refer to in physiology as electrolyte   (   include sodium   ,   potassium   ,   and calcium   )    ,   ion necessary for nerve impulse conduction   ,   muscle contraction and water balance   .
many sport drink and dietary supplement provide these ion to replace those lose from the body via sweat during exercise   .
another way the octet rule can be satisfied be by the sharing of electron between atom to form covalent bond   .
these bond be strong and much more common than ionic bond in the molecule of live organism   .
covalent bond be commonly find in carbon   -   base organic molecule   ,   such as -PRON- dna and protein   .
covalent bond be also find in inorganic molecule like h two o   ,   co two    ,   and o two    .
one   ,   two   ,   or three pair of electron may be share   ,   make single   ,   double   ,   and triple bond   ,   respectively   .
the more covalent bond between two atom   ,   the strong -PRON- connection   .
thus   ,   triple bond be the strong   .
the strength of different level of covalent bonding be one of the main reason live organism have a difficult time in acquire nitrogen for use in construct -PRON- molecule   ,   even though molecular nitrogen   ,   n two    ,   be the most abundant gas in the atmosphere   .
molecular nitrogen consist of two nitrogen atom triple bond to each other and   ,   as with all molecule   ,   the sharing of these three pair of electron between the two nitrogen atom allow for the filling of -PRON- outer electron shell   ,   make the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atom   .
this strong triple bond make -PRON- difficult for live system to break apart this nitrogen in order to use -PRON- as constituent of protein and dna   .
the formation of water molecule provide an example of covalent bonding   .
the hydrogen and oxygen atom that combine to form water molecule be bind together by covalent bond   ,   as show in figure   two    .    nine    .   the electron from the hydrogen split -PRON- time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atom and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atom   .
to completely fill the outer shell of oxygen   ,   which have six electron in -PRON- outer shell but which would be more stable with eight   ,   two electron   (   one from each hydrogen atom   )   be need    hence the well   -   know formula h two o   .
the electron be share between the two element to fill the outer shell of each   ,   make both element more stable   .
there be two type of covalent bond    polar and nonpolar   .
in a polar covalent bond   ,   show in figure   two    .    one   two    ,   the electron be unequally share by the atom and be attract more to one nucleus than the other   .
because of the unequal distribution of electron between the atom of different element   ,   a slightly positive   (   δ +   )   or slightly negative   (   δ –   )   charge develop   .
this partial charge be an important property of water and account for many of -PRON- characteristic   .
water be a polar molecule   ,   with the hydrogen atom acquire a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge   .
this occur because the nucleus of the oxygen atom be more attractive to the electron of the hydrogen atom than the hydrogen nucleus be to the oxygen ' s electron   .
thus oxygen have a high electronegativity than hydrogen and the share electron spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than -PRON- do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atom   ,   give the atom of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charge   ,   respectively   .
another way of state this be that the probability of find a share electron near an oxygen nucleus be more likely than find -PRON- near a hydrogen nucleus   .
either way   ,   the atom ' s relative electronegativity contribute to the development of partial charge whenever one element be significantly more electronegative than the other   ,   and the charge generate by these polar bond may then be use for the formation of hydrogen bond base on the attraction of opposite partial charge   .
(   hydrogen bond   ,   which be discuss in detail below   ,   be weak bond between slightly positively charge hydrogen atom to slightly negatively charge atom in other molecule   .    )   since macromolecule often have atom within -PRON- that differ in electronegativity   ,   polar bond be often present in organic molecule   .
nonpolar covalent bond form between two atom of the same element or between different element that share electron equally   .
for example   ,   molecular oxygen   (   o two    )   be nonpolar because the electron will be equally distribute between the two oxygen atom   .
another example of a nonpolar covalent bond be methane   (   ch four    )    ,   also show in figure   two    .    one   two    .   carbon have four electron in -PRON- outermost shell and need four more to fill -PRON-   .
-PRON- get these four from four hydrogen atom   ,   each atom provide one   ,   make a stable outer shell of eight electron   .
carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but be similar    thus   ,   nonpolar bond form   .
the hydrogen atom each need one electron for -PRON- outermost shell   ,   which be fill when -PRON- contain two electron   .
these element share the electron equally among the carbon and the hydrogen atom   ,   create a nonpolar covalent molecule   .
whether a molecule be polar or nonpolar depend both on bond type and molecular shape   .
both water and carbon dioxide have polar covalent bond   ,   but carbon dioxide be linear   ,   so the partial charge on the molecule cancel each other out   .
ionic and covalent bond between element require energy to break   .
ionic bond be not as strong as covalent   ,   which determine -PRON- behavior in biological system   .
however   ,   not all bond be ionic or covalent bond   .
weak bond can also form between molecule   .
two weak bond that occur frequently be hydrogen bond and van der waal interaction   .
without these two type of bond   ,   life as -PRON- know -PRON- would not exist   .
hydrogen bond provide many of the critical   ,   lifesustain property of water and also stabilize the structure of protein and dna   ,   the building block of cell   .
when polar covalent bond contain hydrogen form   ,   the hydrogen in that bond have a slightly positive charge because hydrogen ' s electron be pull more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen   .
because the hydrogen be slightly positive   ,   -PRON- will be attract to neighbor negative charge   .
when this happen   ,   a weak interaction occur between the δ + of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ – charge on the more electronegative atom of another molecule   ,   usually oxygen or nitrogen   ,   or within the same molecule   .
this interaction be call a hydrogen bond   .
this type of bond be common and occur regularly between water molecule   .
individual hydrogen bond be weak and easily break    however   ,   -PRON- occur in very large number in water and in organic polymer   ,   create a major force in combination   .
hydrogen bond be also responsible for zip together the dna double helix   .
like hydrogen bond   ,   van der waal interaction be weak attraction or interaction between molecule   .
van der waal attraction can occur between any two or more molecule and be dependent on slight fluctuation of the electron density   ,   which be not always symmetrical around an atom   .
for these attraction to happen   ,   the molecule need to be very close to one another   .
these bond -- along with ionic   ,   covalent   ,   and hydrogen bond -- contribute to the three   -   dimensional structure of the protein in -PRON- cell that be necessary for -PRON- proper function   .
pharmaceutical chemist be responsible for the development of new drug and try to determine the mode of action of both old and new drug   .
-PRON- be involve in every step of the drug development process   .
drug can be find in the natural environment or can be synthesize in the laboratory   .
in many case   ,   potential drug find in nature be change chemically in the laboratory to make -PRON- safe and more effective   ,   and sometimes synthetic version of drug substitute for the version find in nature   .
after the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug   ,   the chemist then develop the drug   ,   perhaps chemically alter -PRON-   ,   test -PRON- to see if the drug be toxic   ,   and then design method for efficient large   -   scale production   .
then   ,   the process of get the drug approve for human use begin   .
in the united state   ,   drug approval be handle by the food and drug administration   (   fda   )   and involve a series of large   -   scale experiment use human subject to make sure the drug be not harmful and effectively treat the condition -PRON- aim to treat   .
this process often take several year and require the participation of physician and scientist   ,   in addition to chemist   ,   to complete testing and gain approval   .
an example of a drug that be originally discover in a live organism be paclitaxel   (   taxol   )    ,   an anti   -   cancer drug use to treat breast cancer   .
this drug be discover in the bark of the pacific yew tree   .
another example be aspirin   ,   originally isolate from willow tree bark   .
find drug often mean test hundred of sample of plant   ,   fungus   ,   and other form of life to see if any biologically active compound be find within -PRON-   .
sometimes   ,   traditional medicine can give modern medicine clue to where an active compound can be find   .
for example   ,   the use of willow bark to make medicine have be know for thousand of year   ,   date back to ancient egypt   .
-PRON- be not until the late   one   eight   zero   zero s   ,   however   ,   that the aspirin molecule   ,   know as acetylsalicylic acid   ,   be purify and market for human use   .
occasionally   ,   drug develop for one use be find to have unforeseen effect that allow these drug to be use in other   ,   unrelated way   .
for example   ,   the drug minoxidil   (   rogaine   )   be originally develop to treat high blood pressure   .
when test on human   ,   -PRON- be notice that individual take the drug would grow new hair   .
eventually the drug be market to man and woman with baldness to restore lose hair   .
the career of the pharmaceutical chemist may involve detective work   ,   experimentation   ,   and drug development   ,   all with the goal of make human being healthy   .
why do scientist spend time look for water on other planet   ?
why be water so important   ?
-PRON- be because water be essential to life as -PRON- know -PRON-   .
water be one of the more abundant molecule and the one most critical to life on earth   .
approximately   six   zero   –   seven   zero   percent of the human body be make up of water   .
without -PRON-   ,   life as -PRON- know -PRON- simply would not exist   .
the polarity of the water molecule and -PRON- result hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special property that be intimately tie to the process of life   .
life originally evolve in a watery environment   ,   and most of an organism ' s cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery content of the cell ' s cytoplasm   .
special property of water be -PRON- high heat capacity and heat of vaporization   ,   -PRON- ability to dissolve polar molecule   ,   -PRON- cohesive and adhesive property   ,   and -PRON- dissociation into ion that lead to the generation of ph   .
understand these characteristic of water help to elucidate -PRON- importance in maintain life   .
one of water ' s important property be that -PRON- be compose of polar molecule    the hydrogen and oxygen within water molecule   (   h two o   )   form polar covalent bond   .
while there be no net charge to a water molecule   ,   the polarity of water create a slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen   ,   contribute to water ' s property of attraction   .
water ' s charge be generate because oxygen be more electronegative than hydrogen   ,   make -PRON- more likely that a share electron would be find near the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus   ,   thus generate the partial negative charge near the oxygen   .
as a result of water ' s polarity   ,   each water molecule attract other water molecule because of the opposite charge between water molecule   ,   form hydrogen bond   .
water also attract or be attract to other polar molecule and ion   .
a polar substance that interact readily with or dissolve in water be refer to as hydrophilic   (   hydro   -   = " water "     -   philic = " love "   )    .   in contrast   ,   non   -   polar molecule such as oil and fat do not interact well with water   ,   as show in figure   two    .    one   three   and separate from -PRON- rather than dissolve in -PRON-   ,   as -PRON- see in salad dressing contain oil and vinegar   (   an acidic water solution   )    .   these nonpolar compound be call hydrophobic   (   hydro   -   = " water "     -   phobic = " fear "   )    .   the formation of hydrogen bond be an important quality of the liquid water that be crucial to life as -PRON- know -PRON-   .
as water molecule make hydrogen bond with each other   ,   water take on some unique chemical characteristic compare to other liquid and   ,   since live thing have a high water content   ,   understand these chemical feature be key to understand life   .
in liquid water   ,   hydrogen bond be constantly form and break as the water molecule slide past each other   .
the breaking of these bond be cause by the motion   (   kinetic energy   )   of the water molecule due to the heat contain in the system   .
when the heat be raise as water be boil   ,   the high kinetic energy of the water molecule cause the hydrogen bond to break completely and allow water molecule to escape into the air as gas   (   steam or water vapor   )    .   on the other hand   ,   when the temperature of water be reduce and water freeze   ,   the water molecule form a crystalline structure maintain by hydrogen bonding   (   there be not enough energy to break the hydrogen bond   )   that make ice less dense than liquid water   ,   a phenomenon not see in the solidification of other liquid   .
oil and water do not mix   .
as this macro image of oil and water show   ,   oil do not dissolve in water but form droplet instead   .
this be due to -PRON- be a nonpolar compound   .    (   credit    gautam dogra   )    .   the formation of hydrogen bond be an important quality of the liquid water that be crucial to life as -PRON- know -PRON-   .
as water molecule make hydrogen bond with each other   ,   water take on some unique chemical characteristic compare to other liquid and   ,   since live thing have a high water content   ,   understand these chemical feature be key to understand life   .
in liquid water   ,   hydrogen bond be constantly form and break as the water molecule slide past each other   .
the breaking of these bond be cause by the motion   (   kinetic energy   )   of the water molecule due to the heat contain in the system   .
when the heat be raise as water be boil   ,   the high kinetic energy of the water molecule cause the hydrogen bond to break completely and allow water molecule to escape into the air as gas   (   steam or water vapor   )    .   on the other hand   ,   when the temperature of water be reduce and water freeze   ,   the water molecule form a crystalline structure maintain by hydrogen bonding   (   there be not enough energy to break the hydrogen bond   )   that make ice less dense than liquid water   ,   a phenomenon not see in the solidification of other liquid   .
water ' s low density in -PRON- solid form be due to the way hydrogen bond be orient as -PRON- freeze    the water molecule be push farther apart compare to liquid water   .
with most other liquid   ,   solidification when the temperature drop include the lowering of kinetic energy between molecule   ,   allow -PRON- to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and give the solid a great density than the liquid   .
the low density of ice   ,   illustrate and picture in figure   two    .    one   four    ,   an anomaly   ,   cause -PRON- to float at the surface of liquid water   ,   such as in an iceberg or in the ice cube in a glass of ice water   .
in lake and pond   ,   ice will form on the surface of the water create an insulate barrier that protect the animal and plant life in the pond from freeze   .
without this layer of insulate ice   ,   plant and animal live in the pond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive   .
the detrimental effect of freeze on live organism be cause by the expansion of ice relative to liquid water   .
the ice crystal that form upon freeze rupture the delicate membrane essential for the function of live cell   ,   irreversibly damage -PRON-   .
cell can only survive freezing if the water in -PRON- be temporarily replace by another liquid like glycerol   .
hydrogen bonding make ice less dense than liquid water   .
the   (   a   )   lattice structure of ice make -PRON- less dense than the freely flow molecule of liquid water   ,   enable -PRON- to   (   b   )   float on water   .
water ' s high heat capacity be a property cause by hydrogen bonding among water molecule   .
water have the highest specific heat capacity of any liquid   .
specific heat be define as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change -PRON- temperature by one degree celsius   .
for water   ,   this amount be one calorie   .
-PRON- therefore take water a long time to heat and long time to cool   .
in fact   ,   the specific heat capacity of water be about five time more than that of sand   .
this explain why the land cool faster than the sea   .
due to -PRON- high heat capacity   ,   water be use by warm blooded animal to more evenly disperse heat in -PRON- body    -PRON- act in a similar manner to a car ' s cool system   ,   transport heat from warm place to cool place   ,   cause the body to maintain a more even temperature   .
water also have a high heat of vaporization   ,   the amount of energy require to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas   .
a considerable amount of heat energy   (    five   eight   six   cal   )   be require to accomplish this change in water   .
this process occur on the surface of water   .
as liquid water heat up   ,   hydrogen bonding make -PRON- difficult to separate the liquid water molecule from each other   ,   which be require for -PRON- to enter -PRON- gaseous phase   (   steam   )    .   as a result   ,   water act as a heat sink or heat reservoir and require much more heat to boil than do a liquid such as ethanol   (   grain alcohol   )    ,   whose hydrogen bond with other ethanol molecule be weak than water ' s hydrogen bonding   .
eventually   ,   as water reach -PRON- boiling point of   one   zero   zero åã celsius   (    two   one   two åã fahrenheit   )    ,   the heat be able to break the hydrogen bond between the water molecule   ,   and the kinetic energy   (   motion   )   between the water molecule allow -PRON- to escape from the liquid as a gas   .
even when below -PRON- boiling point   ,   water ' s individual molecule acquire enough energy from other water molecule such that some surface water molecule can escape and vaporize    this process be know as evaporation   .
the fact that hydrogen bond need to be break for water to evaporate mean that a substantial amount of energy be use in the process   .
as the water evaporate   ,   energy be take up by the process   ,   cool the environment where the evaporation be take place   .
in many live organism   ,   include in human   ,   the evaporation of sweat   ,   which be   nine   zero   percent water   ,   allow the organism to cool so that homeostasis of body temperature can be maintain   .
since water be a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charge   ,   ion and polar molecule can readily dissolve in -PRON-   .
therefore   ,   water be refer to as a solvent   ,   a substance capable of dissolve other polar molecule and ionic compound   .
the charge associate with these molecule will form hydrogen bond with water   ,   surround the particle with water molecule   .
this be refer to as a sphere of hydration   ,   or a hydration shell   ,   as illustrate in figure   two    .    one   five   and serve to keep the particle separate or disperse in the water   .
when ionic compound be add to water   ,   the individual ion react with the polar region of the water molecule and -PRON- ionic bond be disrupt in the process of dissociation   .
dissociation occur when atom or group of atom break off from molecule and form ion   .
consider table salt   (   nacl   ,   or sodium chloride   )     when nacl crystal be add to water   ,   the molecule of nacl dissociate into na + and cl – ion   ,   and sphere of hydration form around the ion   ,   illustrate in figure   two    .    one   five    .
the positively charge sodium ion be surround by the partially negative charge of the water molecule ' s oxygen   .
the negatively charge chloride ion be surround by the partially positive charge of the hydrogen on the water molecule   .
have -PRON- ever fill a glass of water to the very top and then slowly add a few more drop   ?
before -PRON- overflow   ,   the water form a dome   -   like shape above the rim of the glass   .
this water can stay above the glass because of the property of cohesion   .
in cohesion   ,   water molecule be attract to each other   (   because of hydrogen bonding   )    ,   keep the molecule together at the liquid   -   gas   (   water   -   air   )   interface   ,   although there be no more room in the glass   .
cohesion allow for the development of surface tension   ,   the capacity of a substance to withstand be rupture when place under tension or stress   .
this be also why water form droplet when place on a dry surface rather than be flatten out by gravity   .
when a small scrap of paper be place onto the droplet of water   ,   the paper float on top of the water droplet even though paper be denser   (   heavy   )   than the water   .
cohesion and surface tension keep the hydrogen bond of water molecule intact and support the item float on the top   .
-PRON- ' s even possible to " float " a needle on top of a glass of water if -PRON- be place gently without break the surface tension   ,   as show in figure   two    .    one   six    .   these cohesive force be relate to water ' s property of adhesion   ,   or the attraction between water molecule and other molecule   .
this attraction be sometimes strong than water ' s cohesive force   ,   especially when the water be expose to charge surface such as those find on the inside of thin glass tube know as capillary tube   .
adhesion be observe when water " climb " up the tube place in a glass of water    notice that the water appear to be high on the side of the tube than in the middle   .
this be because the water molecule be attract to the charge glass wall of the capillary more than -PRON- be to each other and therefore adhere to -PRON-   .
this type of adhesion be call capillary action   ,   and be illustrate in figure   two    .    one   seven    .
the weight of the needle be pull the surface downward    at the same time   ,   the surface tension be pull -PRON- up   ,   suspend -PRON- on the surface of the water and keep -PRON- from sink   .
notice the indentation in the water around the needle   .
these cohesive force be relate to water ' s property of adhesion   ,   or the attraction between water molecule and other molecule   .
this attraction be sometimes strong than water ' s cohesive force   ,   especially when the water be expose to charge surface such as those find on the inside of thin glass tube know as capillary tube   .
adhesion be observe when water " climb " up the tube place in a glass of water    notice that the water appear to be high on the side of the tube than in the middle   .
this be because the water molecule be attract to the charge glass wall of the capillary more than -PRON- be to each other and therefore adhere to -PRON-   .
this type of adhesion be call capillary action   ,   and be illustrate in figure   two    .    one   seven    .
capillary action in a glass tube be cause by the adhesive force exert by the internal surface of the glass exceed the cohesive force between the water molecule -PRON-   .
why be cohesive and adhesive force important for life   ?
cohesive and adhesive force be important for the transport of water from the root to the leaf in plant   .
these force create a " pull " on the water column   .
this pull result from the tendency of water molecule be evaporate on the surface of the plant to stay connected to water molecule below -PRON-   ,   and so -PRON- be pull along   .
plant use this natural phenomenon to help transport water from -PRON- root to -PRON- leaf   .
without these property of water   ,   plant would be unable to receive the water and the dissolved mineral -PRON- require   .
in another example   ,   insect such as the water strider   ,   show in figure   two    .    one   eight    ,   use the surface tension of water to stay afloat on the surface layer of water and even mate there   .
the ph of a solution indicate -PRON- acidity or alkalinity   .   litmus or ph paper   ,   filter paper that have be treat with a natural water   -   soluble dye so -PRON- can be use as a ph indicator   ,   to test how much acid   (   acidity   )   or base   (   alkalinity   )   exist in a solution   .
-PRON- may have even use some to test whether the water in a swimming pool be properly treat   .
in both case   ,   the ph test measure the concentration of hydrogen ion in a give solution   .
hydrogen ion be spontaneously generate in pure water by the dissociation   (   ionization   )   of a small percentage of water molecule into equal number of hydrogen   (   h +   )   ion and hydroxide   (   oh   -    )   ion   .
while the hydroxide ion be keep in solution by -PRON- hydrogen bond with other water molecule   ,   the hydrogen ion   ,   consist of naked proton   ,   be immediately attract to un   -   ionized water molecule   ,   form hydronium ion   (   h three   zero   +   )    .   still   ,   by convention   ,   scientist refer to hydrogen ion and -PRON- concentration as if -PRON- be free in this state in liquid water   .
the concentration of hydrogen ion dissociate from pure water be   one   å ~   one   zero    -    seven   mol h + ion per liter of water   .
mole   (   mol   )   be a way to express the amount of a substance   (   which can be atom   ,   molecule   ,   ion   ,   etc   )    ,   with one mole be equal to   six    .    zero   two   x   one   zero   two   three   particle of the substance   .
therefore   ,    one   mole of water be equal to   six    .    zero   two   x   one   zero   two   three   water molecule   .
the ph be calculate as the negative of the base   one   zero   logarithm of this concentration   .
the log one   zero   of   one   å ~   one   zero    -    seven   be   -    seven    .    zero    ,   and the negative of this number   (   indicate by the " p " of " ph "   )   yield a ph of   seven    .    zero    ,   which be also know as neutral ph   .
the ph inside of human cell and blood be example of two area of the body where near   -   neutral ph be maintain   .
non   -   neutral ph reading result from dissolve acid or base in water   .
use the negative logarithm to generate positive integer   ,   high concentration of hydrogen ion yield a low ph number   ,   whereas low level of hydrogen ion result in a high ph   .
an acid be a substance that increase the concentration of hydrogen ion   (   h +   )   in a solution   ,   usually by have one of -PRON- hydrogen atom dissociate   .
a base provide either hydroxide ion   (   oh –   )   or other negatively charge ion that combine with hydrogen ion   ,   reduce -PRON- concentration in the solution and thereby raise the ph   .
in case where the base release hydroxide ion   ,   these ion bind to free hydrogen ion   ,   generate new water molecule   .
the strong the acid   ,   the more readily -PRON- donate h +   .   for example   ,   hydrochloric acid   (   hcl   )   completely dissociate into hydrogen and chloride ion and be highly acidic   ,   whereas the acid in tomato juice or vinegar do not completely dissociate and be consider weak acid   .
conversely   ,   strong base be those substance that readily donate oh – or take up hydrogen ion   .
sodium hydroxide   (   naoh   )   and many household cleaner be highly alkaline and give up oh – rapidly when place in water   ,   thereby raise the ph   .
an example of a weak basic solution be seawater   ,   which have a ph near   eight    .    zero    ,   close enough to neutral ph that marine organism adapt to this saline environment be able to thrive in -PRON-   .
the ph scale be   ,   as previously mention   ,   an inverse logarithm and range from   zero   to   one   four    (   figure   two    .    one   nine    )    .   anything below   seven    .    zero    (   range from   zero    .    zero   to   six    .    nine    )   be acidic   ,   and anything above   seven    .    zero    (   from   seven    .    one   to   one   four    .    zero    )   be alkaline   .
extreme in ph in either direction from   seven    .    zero   be usually consider inhospitable to life   .
the ph inside cell   (    six    .    eight    )   and the ph in the blood   (    seven    .    four    )   be both very close to neutral   .
however   ,   the environment in the stomach be highly acidic   ,   with a ph of   one   to   two    .   so how do the cell of the stomach survive in such an acidic environment   ?
how do -PRON- homeostatically maintain the near neutral ph inside -PRON-   ?
the answer be that -PRON- can not do -PRON- and be constantly die   .
new stomach cell be constantly produce to replace dead one   ,   which be digest by the stomach acid   .
-PRON- be estimate that the lining of the human stomach be completely replace every seven to ten day   .
the ph scale measure the concentration of hydrogen ion   (   h +   )   in a solution   .
so how can organism whose body require a near   -   neutral ph ingest acidic and basic substance   (   a human drink orange juice   ,   for example   )   and survive   ?
buffer be the key   .
buffer readily absorb excess h + or oh –   ,   keep the ph of the body carefully maintain in the narrow range require for survival   .
maintain a constant blood ph be critical to a person ' s well   -   be   .
the buffer maintain the ph of human blood involve carbonic acid   (   h two co three    )    ,   bicarbonate ion   (   hco three   –   )    ,   and carbon dioxide   (   co two    )    .   when bicarbonate ion combine with free hydrogen ion and become carbonic acid   ,   hydrogen ion be remove   ,   moderate ph change   .
similarly   ,   as show in figure   two    .    two   zero    ,   excess carbonic acid can be convert to carbon dioxide gas and exhale through the lung   .
this prevent too many free hydrogen ion from build up in the blood and dangerously reduce the blood ' s ph   .
likewise   ,   if too much oh – be introduce into the system   ,   carbonic acid will combine with -PRON- to create bicarbonate   ,   lower the ph   .
without this buffer system   ,   the body ' s ph would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy   .
this diagram show the body ' s buffer of blood ph level   .
the blue arrow show the process of raise ph as more co two   be make   .
the purple arrow indicate the reverse process    the lowering of ph as more bicarbonate be create   .
other example of buffer be antacid use to combat excess stomach acid   .
many of these over   -   the   -   counter medication work in the same way as blood buffer   ,   usually with at least one ion capable of absorb hydrogen and moderate ph   ,   bring relief to those that suffer " heartburn " after eat   .
the unique property of water that contribute to this capacity to balance ph -- as well as water ' s other characteristic -- be essential to sustain life on earth   .
cell be make of many complex molecule call macromolecule   ,   such as protein   ,   nucleic acid   (   rna and dna   )    ,   carbohydrate   ,   and lipid   .
the macromolecule be a subset of organic molecule   (   any carbon   -   contain liquid   ,   solid   ,   or gas   )   that be especially important for life   .
the fundamental component for all of these macromolecule be carbon   .
the carbon atom have unique property that allow -PRON- to form covalent bond to as many as four different atom   ,   make this versatile element ideal to serve as the basic structural component   ,   or " backbone   ,   " of the macromolecule   .
individual carbon atom have an incomplete outermost electron shell   .
with an atomic number of   six    (   six electron and six proton   )    ,   the first two electron fill the inner shell   ,   leave four in the second shell   .
therefore   ,   carbon atom can form up to four covalent bond with other atom to satisfy the octet rule   .
the methane molecule provide an example    -PRON- have the chemical formula ch four    .
each of -PRON- four hydrogen atom form a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by share a pair of electron   .
this result in a fill outermost shell   .
hydrocarbon be organic molecule consist entirely of carbon and hydrogen   ,   such as methane   (   ch four    )   describe above   .
-PRON- often use hydrocarbon in -PRON- daily life as fuel -- like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a light   .
the many covalent bond between the atom in hydrocarbon store a great amount of energy   ,   which be release when these molecule be burn   (   oxidize   )    .   methane   ,   an excellent fuel   ,   be the simple hydrocarbon molecule   ,   with a central carbon atom bond to four different hydrogen atom   ,   as illustrate in figure   two    .    two   one    .
the geometry of the methane molecule   ,   where the atom reside in three dimension   ,   be determine by the shape of -PRON- electron orbital   .
the carbon and the four hydrogen atom form a shape know as a tetrahedron   ,   with four triangular face    for this reason   ,   methane be describe as have tetrahedral geometry   .
methane have a tetrahedral geometry   ,   with each of the four hydrogen atom space   one   zero   nine    .    five åã apart   .
as the backbone of the large molecule of live thing   ,   hydrocarbon may exist as linear carbon chain   ,   carbon ring   ,   or combination of both   .
furthermore   ,   individual carbon   -   to   -   carbon bond may be single   ,   double   ,   or triple covalent bond   ,   and each type of bond affect the geometry of the molecule in a specific way   .
this three   -   dimensional shape or conformation of the large molecule of life   (   macromolecule   )   be critical to how -PRON- function   .
hydrocarbon chain be form by successive bond between carbon atom and may be branched or unbranched   .
furthermore   ,   the overall geometry of the molecule be alter by the different geometry of single   ,   double   ,   and triple covalent bond   ,   illustrate in figure   two    .    two   two    .
the hydrocarbon ethane   ,   ethene   ,   and ethyne serve as example of how different carbon   -   to   -   carbon bond affect the geometry of the molecule   .
the name of all three molecule start with the prefix " eth   -    ,   " which be the prefix for two carbon hydrocarbon   .
the suffix "   -   ane   ,   " "   -   ene   ,   " and "   -   yne " refer to the presence of single   ,   double   ,   or triple carbon   -   carbon bond   ,   respectively   .
thus   ,   propane   ,   propene   ,   and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecule   ,   butane   ,   butane   ,   and butyne for four carbon molecule   ,   and so on   .
double and triple bond change the geometry of the molecule    single bond allow rotation along the axis of the bond   ,   whereas double bond lead to a planar configuration and triple bond to a linear one   .
these geometry have a significant impact on the shape a particular molecule can assume   .
when carbon form single bond with other atom   ,   the shape be tetrahedral   .
when two carbon atom form a double bond   ,   the shape be planar   ,   or flat   .
single bond   ,   like those find in ethane   ,   be able to rotate   .
double bond   ,   like those find in ethene can not rotate   ,   so the atom on either side be lock in place   .
so far   ,   the hydrocarbon -PRON- have discuss have be aliphatic hydrocarbon   ,   which consist of linear chain of carbon atom   .
another type of hydrocarbon   ,   aromatic hydrocarbon   ,   consist of closed ring of carbon atom   .
ring structure be find in hydrocarbon   ,   sometimes with the presence of double bond   ,   which can be see by compare the structure of cyclohexane to benzene in figure   two    .    two   three    .   example of biological molecule that incorporate the benzene ring include some amino acid and cholesterol and -PRON- derivative   ,   include the hormone estrogen and testosterone   .
the benzene ring be also find in the herbicide   two    ,    four    -   d   .   benzene be a natural component of crude oil and have be classify as a carcinogen   .
some hydrocarbon have both aliphatic and aromatic portion    beta   -   carotene be an example of such a hydrocarbon   .
carbon can form five   -   and six membered ring   .
single or double bond may connect the carbon in the ring   ,   and nitrogen may be substitute for carbon   .
the three   -   dimensional placement of atom and chemical bond within organic molecule be central to understand -PRON- chemistry   .
molecule that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement   (   structure   )   of -PRON- atom and   /   or chemical bond be know as isomer   .
structural isomer   (   like butane and isobutene show in figure   two    .    two   four a   )   differ in the placement of -PRON- covalent bond    both molecule have four carbon and ten hydrogen   (   c four h one   zero    )    ,   but the different arrangement of the atom within the molecule lead to difference in -PRON- chemical property   .
for example   ,   due to -PRON- different chemical property   ,   butane be suit for use as a fuel for cigarette lighter and torch   ,   whereas isobutene be suit for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray can   .
geometric isomer   ,   on the other hand   ,   have similar placement of -PRON- covalent bond but differ in how these bond be make to the surround atom   ,   especially in carbon   -   to   -   carbon double bond   .
in the simple molecule butene   (   c four h eight    )    ,   the two methyl group   (   ch three    )   can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule   ,   as illustrate in figure   two    .    two   four b   .
when the carbon be bind on the same side of the double bond   ,   this be the cis configuration    if -PRON- be on opposite side of the double bond   ,   -PRON- be a trans configuration   .
in the tran configuration   ,   the carbon form a more or less linear structure   ,   whereas the carbon in the cis configuration make a bend   (   change in direction   )   of the carbon backbone   .
in triglyceride   (   fat and oil   )    ,   long carbon chain know as fatty acid may contain double bond   ,   which can be in either the cis or tran configuration   ,   illustrate in figure   two    .    two   five    .   fat with at least one double bond between carbon atom be unsaturated fat   .
when some of these bond be in the cis configuration   ,   the result bend in the carbon backbone of the chain mean that triglyceride molecule can not pack tightly   ,   so -PRON- remain liquid   (   oil   )   at room temperature   .
on the other hand   ,   triglycerid with tran double bond   (   popularly call tran fat   )    ,   have relatively linear fatty acid that be able to pack tightly together at room temperature and form solid fat   .
in the human diet   ,   tran fat be link to an increase risk of cardiovascular disease   ,   so many food manufacturer have reduce or eliminate -PRON- use in recent year   .
in contrast to unsaturated fat   ,   triglyceride without double bond between carbon atom be call saturate fat   ,   mean that -PRON- contain all the hydrogen atom available   .
saturate fat be a solid at room temperature and usually of animal origin   .
these space   -   filling model show a cis   (   oleic acid   )   and a tran   (   eliadic acid   )   fatty acid   .
notice the bend in the molecule because by the cis configuration   .
enantiomer be molecule that share the same chemical structure and chemical bond but differ in the three   -   dimensional placement of atom so that -PRON- be mirror image   .
as show in figure   two    .    two   six    ,   an amino acid alanine example   ,   the two structure be non   -   superimposable   .
in nature   ,   only the l   -   form of amino acid be use to make protein   .
some d form of amino acid be see in the cell wall of bacteria   ,   but never in -PRON- protein   .
similarly   ,   the d   -   form of glucose be the main product of photosynthesis and the l   -   form of the molecule be rarely see in nature   .
d   -   alanine and l   -   alanine be example of enantiomer or mirror image   .
only the l   -   form of amino acid be use to make protein   .
functional group be group of atom that occur within molecule and confer specific chemical property to those molecule   .
-PRON- be find along the " carbon backbone " of macromolecule   .
this carbon backbone be form by chain and   /   or ring of carbon atom with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen   .
molecule with other element in -PRON- carbon backbone be substitute hydrocarbon   .
the functional group in a macromolecule be usually attach to the carbon backbone at one or several different place along -PRON- chain and   /   or ring structure   .
each of the four type of macromolecule -- protein   ,   lipid   ,   carbohydrate   ,   and nucleic acid -- have -PRON- own characteristic set of functional group that contribute greatly to -PRON- differ chemical property and -PRON- function in live organism   .
a functional group can participate in specific chemical reaction   .
some of the important functional group in biological molecule be show in figure   two    .    two   seven     -PRON- include    hydroxyl   ,   methyl   ,   carbonyl   ,   carboxyl   ,   amino   ,   phosphate   ,   and sulfhydryl   .
these group play an important role in the formation of molecule like dna   ,   protein   ,   carbohydrate   ,   and lipid   .
functional group be usually classify as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depend on -PRON- charge or polarity characteristic   .
an example of a hydrophobic group be the non   -   polar methane molecule   .
among the hydrophilic functional group be the carboxyl group find in amino acid   ,   some amino acid side chain   ,   and the fatty acid that form triglyceride and phospholipid   .
this carboxyl group ionize to release hydrogen ion   (   h +   )   from the cooh group result in the negatively charge coo   -   group    this contribute to the hydrophilic nature of whatev molecule -PRON- be find on   .
other functional group   ,   such as the carbonyl group   ,   have a partially negatively charge oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bond with water molecule   ,   again make the molecule more hydrophilic   .
the functional group show here be find in many different biological molecule   .
hydrogen bond between functional group   (   within the same molecule or between different molecule   )   be important to the function of many macromolecule and help -PRON- to fold properly into and maintain the appropriate shape for function   .
hydrogen bond be also involve in various recognition process   ,   such as dna complementary base pairing and the binding of an enzyme to -PRON- substrate   ,   as illustrate in figure   two    .    two   eight    .   matter be anything that occupy space and have mass   .
-PRON- be make up of element   .
all of the   nine   two   element that occur naturally have unique quality that allow -PRON- to combine in various way to create molecule   ,   which in turn combine to form cell   ,   tissue   ,   organ system   ,   and organism   .
atom   ,   which consist of proton   ,   neutron   ,   and electron   ,   be the small unit of an element that retain all of the property of that element   .
electron can be transfer   ,   share   ,   or because charge disparity between atom to create bond   ,   include ionic   ,   covalent   ,   and hydrogen bond   ,   as well as van der waal interaction   .
water have many property that be critical to maintain life   .
-PRON- be a polar molecule   ,   allow for the formation of hydrogen bond   .
hydrogen bond allow ion and other polar molecule to dissolve in water   .
therefore   ,   water be an excellent solvent   .
the hydrogen bond between water molecule because the water to have a high heat capacity   ,   mean -PRON- take a lot of add heat to raise -PRON- temperature   .
as the temperature rise   ,   the hydrogen bond between water continually break and form anew   .
this allow for the overall temperature to remain stable   ,   although energy be add to the system   .
water also exhibit a high heat of vaporization   ,   which be key to how organism cool -PRON- by the evaporation of sweat   .
water ' s cohesive force allow for the property of surface tension   ,   whereas -PRON- adhesive property be see as water rise inside capillary tube   .
the ph value be a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution and be one of many chemical characteristic that be highly regulated in live organism through homeostasis   .
acid and base can change ph value   ,   but buffer tend to moderate the change -PRON- because   .
these property of water be intimately connect to the biochemical and physical process perform by live organism   ,   and life would be very different if these property be alter   ,   if -PRON- could exist at all   .
the unique property of carbon make -PRON- a central part of biological molecule   .
carbon bind to oxygen   ,   hydrogen   ,   and nitrogen covalently to form the many molecule important for cellular function   .
carbon have four electron in -PRON- outermost shell and can form four bond   .
carbon and hydrogen can form hydrocarbon chain or ring   .
functional group be group of atom that confer specific property to hydrocarbon   (   or substitute hydrocarbon   )   chain or ring that define -PRON- overall chemical characteristic and function   .
food provide the body with the nutrient -PRON- need to survive   .
many of these critical nutrient be biological macromolecule   ,   or large molecule   ,   necessary for life   .
these macromolecule   (   polymer   )   be build from different combination of small organic molecule   (   monomer   )    .   what specific type of biological macromolecule do live thing require   ?
how be these molecule form   ?
what function do -PRON- serve   ?
in this chapter   ,   these question will be explore   .
as -PRON- ' ve learn   ,   biological macromolecule be large molecule   ,   necessary for life   ,   that be build from small organic molecule   .
there be four major class of biological macromolecule   (   carbohydrate   ,   lipid   ,   protein   ,   and nucleic acid   )     each be an important cell component and perform a wide array of function   .
combine   ,   these molecule make up the majority of a cell ' s dry mass   (   recall that water make up the majority of -PRON- complete mass   )    .   biological macromolecule be organic   ,   mean -PRON- contain carbon   .
in addition   ,   -PRON- may contain hydrogen   ,   oxygen   ,   nitrogen   ,   and additional minor element   .
most macromolecule be make from single subunit   ,   or building block   ,   call monomer   .
the monomer combine with each other use covalent bond to form large molecule know as polymer   .
in do so   ,   monomer release water molecule as byproduct   .
this type of reaction be know as dehydration synthesis   ,   which mean " to put together while lose water   .   " in a dehydration synthesis reaction   (   figure   three    .    two    )    ,   the hydrogen of one monomer combine with the hydroxyl group of another monomer   ,   release a molecule of water   .
at the same time   ,   the monomer share electron and form covalent bond   .
as additional monomer join   ,   this chain of repeat monomer form a polymer   .
different type of monomer can combine in many configuration   ,   give rise to a diverse group of macromolecule   .
even one kind of monomer can combine in a variety of way to form several different polymer    for example   ,   glucose monomer be the constituent of starch   ,   glycogen   ,   and cellulose   .
polymer be break down into monomer in a process know as hydrolysis   ,   which mean " to split water   ,   " a reaction in which a water molecule be use during the breakdown   (   figure   three    .    three    )    .   during these reaction   ,   the polymer be break into two component    one part gain a hydrogen atom   (   h +   )   and the other gain a hydroxyl molecule   (   oh –   )   from a split water molecule   .
dehydration and hydrolysis reaction be catalyze   ,   or " speed up   ,   " by specific enzyme    dehydration reaction involve the formation of new bond   ,   require energy   ,   while hydrolysis reaction break bond and release energy   .
these reaction be similar for most macromolecule   ,   but each monomer and polymer reaction be specific for -PRON- class   .
for example   ,   in -PRON- body   ,   food be hydrolyze   ,   or break down   ,   into small molecule by catalytic enzyme in the digestive system   .
this allow for easy absorption of nutrient by cell in the intestine   .
each macromolecule be break down by a specific enzyme   .
for instance   ,   carbohydrate be break down by amylase   ,   sucrase   ,   lactase   ,   or maltase   .
protein be break down by the enzyme pepsin and peptidase   ,   and by hydrochloric acid   .
lipid be break down by lipase   .
breakdown of these macromolecule provide energy for cellular activity   .
most people be familiar with carbohydrate   ,   one type of macromolecule   ,   especially when -PRON- come to what -PRON- eat   .
to lose weight   ,   some individual adhere to " low   -   carb " diet   .
athlete   ,   in contrast   ,   often " carb   -   load " before important competition to ensure that -PRON- have enough energy to compete at a high level   .
carbohydrate be   ,   in fact   ,   an essential part of -PRON- diet    grain   ,   fruit   ,   and vegetable be all natural source of carbohydrate   .
carbohydrate provide energy to the body   ,   particularly through glucose   ,   a simple sugar that be a component of starch and an ingredient in many staple food   .
carbohydrate also have other important function in human   ,   animal   ,   and plant   .
carbohydrate can be represent by the stoichiometric formula   (   ch two o   )   n   ,   where n be the number of carbon in the molecule   .
in other word   ,   the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen be   one      two      one   in carbohydrate molecule   .
this formula also explain the origin of the term " carbohydrate "    the component be carbon   (   " carbo "   )   and the component of water   (   hence   ,   " hydrate "   )    .   carbohydrate be classify into three subtype    monosaccharid   ,   disaccharide   ,   and polysaccharide   .
monosaccharide   (   mono   -   = " one "    sacchar   -   = " sweet "   )   be simple sugar   ,   the most common of which be glucose   .
in monosaccharide   ,   the number of carbon usually range from three to seven   .
most monosaccharide name end with the suffix   -   ose   .
if the sugar have an aldehyde group   (   the functional group with the structure r   -   cho   )    ,   -PRON- be know as an aldose   ,   and if -PRON- have a ketone group   (   the functional group with the structure rc   (   = o   )   r   '    )    ,   -PRON- be know as a ketose   .
depend on the number of carbon in the sugar   ,   -PRON- also may be know as triose   (   three carbon   )    ,   pentos   (   five carbon   )    ,   and or hexose   (   six carbon   )    .   see figure   three    .    four   for an illustration of the monosaccharide   .
the chemical formula for glucose be c six h one   two o six    .
in human   ,   glucose be an important source of energy   .
during cellular respiration   ,   energy be release from glucose   ,   and that energy be use to help make adenosine triphosphate   (   atp   )    .   plant synthesize glucose use carbon dioxide and water   ,   and glucose in turn be use for energy requirement for the plant   .
excess glucose be often store as starch that be catabolize   (   the breakdown of large molecule by cell   )   by human and other animal that feed on plant   .
galactose   (   part of lactose   ,   or milk sugar   )   and fructose   (   find in sucrose   ,   in fruit   )   be other common monosaccharide   .
although glucose   ,   galactose   ,   and fructose all have the same chemical formula   (   c six h one   two o six    )    ,   -PRON- differ structurally and chemically   (   and be know as isomer   )   because of the different arrangement of functional group around the asymmetric carbon    all of these monosaccharide have more than one asymmetric carbon   (   figure   three    .    five    )    .   monosaccharide can exist as a linear chain or as ring   -   shaped molecule    in aqueous solution -PRON- be usually find in ring form   (   figure   three    .    six    )    .   glucose in a ring form can have two different arrangement of the hydroxyl group   (   oh   )   around the anomeric carbon   (   carbon   one   that become asymmetric in the process of ring formation   )    .   if the hydroxyl group be below carbon number   one   in the sugar   ,   -PRON- be say to be in the alpha   (   α   )   position   ,   and if -PRON- be above the plane   ,   -PRON- be say to be in the beta   (   β   )   position   .
disaccharide   (   di   -   = " two "   )   form when two monosaccharide undergo a dehydration reaction   (   also know as a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis   )    .   during this process   ,   the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combine with the hydrogen of another monosaccharide   ,   release a molecule of water and form a covalent bond   .
a covalent bond form between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule   (   in this case   ,   between two monosaccharide   )   be know as a glycosidic bond   (   figure   three    .    seven    )    .   glycosidic bond   (   also call glycosidic linkage   )   can be of the alpha or the beta type   .
common disaccharide include lactose   ,   maltose   ,   and sucrose   (   figure   three    .    eight    )    .   lactose be a disaccharide consisting of the monomer glucose and galactose   .
-PRON- be find naturally in milk   .
maltose   ,   or malt sugar   ,   be a disaccharide form by a dehydration reaction between two glucose molecule   .
the most common disaccharide be sucrose   ,   or table sugar   ,   which be compose of the monomer glucose and fructose   .
a long chain of monosaccharide link by glycosidic bond be know as a polysaccharide   (   poly   -   = " many "   )    .   the chain may be branched or unbranched   ,   and -PRON- may contain different type of monosaccharide   .
the molecular weight may be   one   zero   zero    ,    zero   zero   zero   dalton or more depend on the number of monomer join   .
starch   ,   glycogen   ,   cellulose   ,   and chitin be primary example of polysaccharide   .
starch be the store form of sugar in plant and be make up of a mixture of amylose and amylopectin   (   both polymer of glucose   )    .   plant be able to synthesize glucose   ,   and the excess glucose   ,   beyond the plant ' s immediate energy need   ,   be store as starch in different plant part   ,   include root and seed   .
the starch in the seed provide food for the embryo as -PRON- germinate and can also act as a source of food for human and animal   .
the starch that be consume by human be break down by enzyme   ,   such as salivary amylase   ,   into small molecule   ,   such as maltose and glucose   .
the cell can then absorb the glucose   .
starch be make up of glucose monomer that be join by α   one    -    four   or α   one    -    six   glycosidic bond   .
the number   one    -    four   and   one    -    six   refer to the carbon number of the two residue that have join to form the bond   .
as illustrate in figure   three    .    nine    ,   amylose be starch form by unbranched chain of glucose monomer   (   only α   one    -    four   linkage   )    ,   whereas amylopectin be a branched polysaccharide   (   α   one    -    six   linkage at the branch point   )    .   glycogen be the storage form of glucose in human and other vertebrate and be make up of monomer of glucose   .
glycogen be the animal equivalent of starch and be a highly branched molecule usually store in liver and muscle cell   .
whenever blood glucose level decrease   ,   glycogen be break down to release glucose in a process know as glycogenolysis   .
cellulose be the most abundant natural biopolymer   .
the cell wall of plant be mostly make of cellulose    this provide structural support to the cell   .
wood and paper be mostly cellulosic in nature   .
cellulose be make up of glucose monomer that be link by β   one    -    four   glycosidic bond   (   figure   three    .    one   zero    )    .   as show in figure   three    .    one   zero    ,   every other glucose monomer in cellulose be flip over   ,   and the monomer be pack tightly as extend long chain   .
this give cellulose -PRON- rigidity and high tensile strength -- which be so important to plant cell   .
while the β   one    -    four   linkage can not be break down by human digestive enzyme   ,   herbivore such as cow   ,   koala   ,   buffalo   ,   and horse be able   ,   with the help of the specialize flora in -PRON- stomach   ,   to digest plant material that be rich in cellulose and use -PRON- as a food source   .
in these animal   ,   certain specie of bacteria and protist reside in the rumen   (   part of the digestive system of herbivore   )   and secrete the enzyme cellulase   .
the appendix of grazing animal also contain bacteria that digest cellulose   ,   give -PRON- an important role in the digestive system of ruminant   .
cellulas can break down cellulose into glucose monomer that can be use as an energy source by the animal   .
termite be also able to break down cellulose because of the presence of other organism in -PRON- body that secrete cellulas   .
carbohydrate serve various function in different animal   .
arthropod   (   insect   ,   crustacean   ,   and other   )   have an outer skeleton   ,   call the exoskeleton   ,   which protect -PRON- internal body part   (   as see in the bee in figure   three    .    one   one    )    .   this exoskeleton be make of the biological macromolecule chitin   ,   which be a polysaccharide   -   contain nitrogen   .
-PRON- be make of repeat unit of n   -   acetyl   -   β   -   d   -   glucosamine   ,   a modified sugar   .
chitin be also a major component of fungal cell wall    fungus be neither animal nor plant and form a kingdom of -PRON- own in the domain eukarya   .
be carbohydrate good for -PRON-   ?
people who wish to lose weight be often tell that carbohydrate be bad for -PRON- and should be avoid   .
some diet completely forbid carbohydrate consumption   ,   claim that a low   -   carbohydrate diet help people to lose weight faster   .
however   ,   carbohydrate have be an important part of the human diet for thousand of year    artifact from ancient civilization show the presence of wheat   ,   rice   ,   and corn in -PRON- ancestor ’ storage area   .
carbohydrate should be supplement with protein   ,   vitamin   ,   and fat to be part of a well   -   balanced diet   .
calorie   -   wise   ,   a gram of carbohydrate provide   four    .    three   kcal   .
for comparison   ,   fat provide   nine   kcal   /   g   ,   a less desirable ratio   .
carbohydrate contain soluble and insoluble element    the insoluble part be know as fiber   ,   which be mostly cellulose   .
fiber have many us    -PRON- promote regular bowel movement by add bulk   ,   and -PRON- regulate the rate of consumption of blood glucose   .
fiber also help to remove excess cholesterol from the body    fiber bind to the cholesterol in the small intestine   ,   then attach to the cholesterol and prevent the cholesterol particle from enter the bloodstream   ,   and then cholesterol exit the body via the fece   .
fiber   -   rich diet also have a protective role in reduce the occurrence of colon cancer   .
in addition   ,   a meal contain whole grain and vegetable give a feeling of fullness   .
as an immediate source of energy   ,   glucose be break down during the process of cellular respiration   ,   which produce atp   ,   the energy currency of the cell   .
without the consumption of carbohydrate   ,   the availability of " instant energy " would be reduce   .
eliminate carbohydrate from the diet be not the good way to lose weight   .
a low   -   calorie diet that be rich in whole grain   ,   fruit   ,   vegetable   ,   and lean meat   ,   together with plenty of exercise and plenty of water   ,   be the more sensible way to lose weight   .
lipid include a diverse group of compound that be largely nonpolar in nature   .
this be because -PRON- be hydrocarbon that include mostly nonpolar carbon – carbon or carbon – hydrogen bond   .
non   -   polar molecule be hydrophobic   (   “ water fear "   )    ,   or insoluble in water   .
lipid perform many different function in a cell   .
cell store energy for long   -   term use in the form of fat   .
lipid also provide insulation from the environment for plant and animal   (   figure   three    .    one   two    )    .   for example   ,   -PRON- help keep aquatic bird and mammal dry when form a protective layer over fur or feather because of -PRON- water   -   repellant hydrophobic nature   .
lipid be also the building block of many hormone and be an important constituent of all cellular membrane   .
lipid include fat   ,   oil   ,   wax   ,   phospholipid   ,   and steroid   .
a fat molecule consist of two main component -- glycerol and fatty acid   .
glycerol be an organic compound   (   alcohol   )   with three carbon   ,   five hydrogen   ,   and three hydroxyl   (   oh   )   group   .
fatty acid have a long chain of hydrocarbon to which a carboxyl group be attach   ,   hence the name " fatty acid   .   " the number of carbon in the fatty acid may range from   four   to   three   six     most common be those contain   one   two   –   one   eight   carbon   .
in a fat molecule   ,   the fatty acid be attach to each of the three carbon of the glycerol molecule with an ester bond through an oxygen atom   (   figure   three    .    one   three    )    .   during this ester bond formation   ,   three water molecule be release   .
the three fatty acid in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar   .
fat be also call triacylglycerol or triglyceride because of -PRON- chemical structure   .
some fatty acid have common name that specify -PRON- origin   .
for example   ,   palmitic acid   ,   a saturated fatty acid   ,   be derive from the palm tree   .
arachidic acid be derive from arachis hypogea   ,   the scientific name for groundnut or peanut   .
fatty acid may be saturate or unsaturated   .
in a fatty acid chain   ,   if there be only single bond between neighboring carbon in the hydrocarbon chain   ,   the fatty acid be say to be saturate   .
saturate fatty acid be saturate with hydrogen    in other word   ,   the number of hydrogen atom attach to the carbon skeleton be maximize   .
stearic acid be an example of a saturated fatty acid   (   figure   three    .    one   four    )   most unsaturated fat be liquid at room temperature and be call oil   .
if there be one double bond in the molecule   ,   then -PRON- be know as a monounsaturated fat   (   e   .   g   .    ,   olive oil   )    ,   and if there be more than one double bond   ,   then -PRON- be know as a polyunsaturat fat   (   e   .   g   .    ,   canola oil   )    .   when a fatty acid have no double bond   ,   -PRON- be know as a saturated fatty acid because no more hydrogen may be add to the carbon atom of the chain   .
a fat may contain similar or different fatty acid attach to glycerol   .
long straight fatty acid with single bond tend to get pack tightly and be solid at room temperature   .
animal fat with stearic acid and palmitic acid   (   common in meat   )   and the fat with butyric acid   (   common in butter   )   be example of saturate fat   .
mammal store fat in specialized cell call adipocyte   ,   where globule of fat occupy most of the cell ' s volume   .
in plant   ,   fat or oil be store in many seed and be use as a source of energy during seedl development   .
unsaturated fat or oil be usually of plant origin and contain cis unsaturated fatty acid   .
cis and tran indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond   .
if hydrogen be present in the same plane   ,   -PRON- be refer to as a cis fat    if the hydrogen atom be on two different plane   ,   -PRON- be refer to as a trans fat   .
the cis double bond cause a bend or a " kink " that prevent the fatty acid from pack tightly   ,   keep -PRON- liquid at room temperature   (   figure   three    .    one   six    )    .   olive oil   ,   corn oil   ,   canola oil   ,   and cod liver oil be example of unsaturated fat   .
unsaturated fat help to lower blood cholesterol level whereas saturate fat contribute to plaque formation in the artery   .
in the food industry   ,   oil be artificially hydrogenate to make -PRON- semi   -   solid and of a consistency desirable for many process food product   .
simply speak   ,   hydrogen gas be bubble through oil to solidify -PRON-   .
during this hydrogenation process   ,   double bond of the cis   -   conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be convert to double bond in the tran   -   conformation   .
margarine   ,   some type of peanut butter   ,   and shortening be example of artificially hydrogenate tran fat   .
recent study have show that an increase in tran fat in the human diet may lead to an increase in level of low   -   density lipoprotein   (   ldl   )    ,   or " bad " cholesterol   ,   which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the artery   ,   result in heart disease   .
many fast food restaurant have recently ban the use of tran fat   ,   and food label be require to display the tran fat content   .
essential fatty acid be fatty acid require but not synthesize by the human body   .
consequently   ,   -PRON- have to be supplement through ingestion via the diet   .
omega   -    three   fatty acid   (   like that show in figure   three    .    one   seven    )   fall into this category and be one of only two know for human   (   the other be omega   -    six   fatty acid   )    .   these be polyunsaturat fatty acid and be call omega   -    three   because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain be connect to -PRON- neighboring carbon by a double bond   .
the farth carbon away from the carboxyl group be number as the omega   (   ω   )   carbon   ,   and if the double bond be between the third and fourth carbon from that end   ,   -PRON- be know as an omega   -    three   fatty acid   .
nutritionally important because the body do not make -PRON-   ,   omega   -    three   fatty acid include alpha   -   linoleic acid   (   ala   )    ,   eicosapentaenoic acid   (   epa   )    ,   and docosahexaenoic acid   (   dha   )    ,   all of which be polyunsaturat   .
salmon   ,   trout   ,   and tuna be good source of omega   -    three   fatty acid   .
research indicate that omega   -    three   fatty acid reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attack   ,   reduce triglyceride in the blood   ,   low blood pressure   ,   and prevent thrombosis by inhibit blood clotting   .
-PRON- also reduce inflammation   ,   and may help reduce the risk of some cancer in animal   .
like carbohydrate   ,   fat have receive a lot of bad publicity   .
-PRON- be true that eat an excess of fry food and other " fatty " food lead to weight gain   .
however   ,   fat do have important function   .
many vitamin be fat soluble   ,   and fat serve as a long   -   term storage form of fatty acid    a source of energy   .
-PRON- also provide insulation for the body   .
therefore   ,   " healthy " fat in moderate amount should be consume on a regular basis   .
wax cover the feather of some aquatic bird and the leaf surface of some plant   .
because of the hydrophobic nature of wax   ,   -PRON- prevent water from stick on the surface   (   figure   three    .    one   eight    )    .   wax be make up of long fatty acid chain esterify to long   -   chain alcohol   .
phospholipid be major constituent of the plasma membrane   ,   the outermost layer of animal cell   .
like fat   ,   -PRON- be compose of fatty acid chain attach to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone   .
instead of three fatty acid attach as in triglyceride   ,   however   ,   there be two fatty acid form diacylglycerol   ,   and the third carbon of the glycerol backbone be occupy by a modify phosphate group   (   figure   three    .    one   nine    )    .   a phosphate group alone attach to a diaglycerol do not qualify as a phospholipid    -PRON- be phosphatidate   (   diacylglycerol   three    -   phosphate   )    ,   the precursor of phospholipid   .
the phosphate group be modify by an alcohol   .
phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine be two important phospholipid that be find in plasma membrane   .
a phospholipid be an amphipathic molecule   ,   mean -PRON- have a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part   .
the fatty acid chain be hydrophobic and can not interact with water   ,   whereas the phosphate   -   contain group be hydrophilic and interact with water the head be the hydrophilic part   ,   and the tail contain the hydrophobic fatty acid   .
in a membrane   ,   a bilayer of phospholipid form the matrix of the structure   ,   the fatty acid tail of phospholipid face inside   ,   away from water   ,   whereas the phosphate group face the outside   ,   aqueous side   (   figure   three    .    two   zero    )    .   phospholipid be responsible for the dynamic nature of the plasma membrane   .
if a drop of phospholipid be place in water   ,   -PRON- spontaneously form a structure know as a micelle   ,   where the hydrophilic phosphate head face the outside and the fatty acid face the interior of this structure   .
unlike the phospholipid and fat discuss early   ,   steroid have a fused ring structure   .
although -PRON- do not resemble the other lipid   ,   -PRON- be group with -PRON- because -PRON- be also hydrophobicand insoluble in water   .
all steroid have four link carbon ring and several of -PRON-   ,   like cholesterol   ,   have a short tail   (   figure   three    .    two   one    )    .   many steroid also have the – oh functional group   ,   which put -PRON- in the alcohol classification   (   sterol   )    .   cholesterol be the most common steroid   .
cholesterol be mainly synthesize in the liver and be the precursor to many steroid hormone such as testosterone and estradiol   ,   which be secrete by the gonad and endocrine gland   .
-PRON- be also the precursor to vitamin d   .   cholesterol be also the precursor of bile salt   ,   which help in the emulsification of fat and -PRON- subsequent absorption by cell   .
although cholesterol be often speak of in negative term by lie people   ,   -PRON- be necessary for proper functioning of the body   .
-PRON- be a component of the plasma membrane of animal cell and be find within the phospholipid bilayer   .
be the outermost structure in animal cell   ,   the plasma membrane be responsible for the transport of material and cellular recognition and -PRON- be involve in cell   -   to   -   cell communication   .
protein be one of the most abundant organic molecule in living system and have the most diverse range of function of all macromolecule   .
protein may be structural   ,   regulatory   ,   contractile   ,   or protective    -PRON- may serve in transport   ,   storage   ,   or membrane    or -PRON- may be toxin or enzyme   .
each cell in a live system may contain thousand of protein   ,   each with a unique function   .
-PRON- structure   ,   like -PRON- function   ,   vary greatly   .
-PRON- be all   ,   however   ,   polymer of amino acid   ,   arrange in a linear sequence   .
enzyme   ,   which be produce by live cell   ,   be catalyst in biochemical reaction   (   like digestion   )   and be usually complex or conjugate protein   .
each enzyme be specific for the substrate   (   a reactant that bind to an enzyme   )   -PRON- act on   .
the enzyme may help in breakdown   ,   rearrangement   ,   or synthesis reaction   .
enzyme that break down -PRON- substrate be call catabolic enzyme   ,   enzyme that build more complex molecule from -PRON- substrate be call anabolic enzyme   ,   and enzyme that affect the rate of reaction be call catalytic enzyme   .
-PRON- should be note that all enzyme increase the rate of reaction and   ,   therefore   ,   be consider to be organic catalyst   .
an example of an enzyme be salivary amylase   ,   which hydrolyze -PRON- substrate amylose   ,   a component of starch   .
hormone be chemical   -   signaling molecule   ,   usually small protein or steroid   ,   secrete by endocrine cell that act to control or regulate specific physiological process   ,   include growth   ,   development   ,   metabolism   ,   and reproduction   .
for example   ,   insulin be a protein hormone that help to regulate the blood glucose level   .
the primary type and function of protein be list in table   three    .    one    .   protein have different shape and molecular weight    some protein be globular in shape whereas other be fibrous in nature   .
for example   ,   hemoglobin be a globular protein   ,   but collagen   ,   find in -PRON- skin   ,   be a fibrous protein   .
protein shape be critical to -PRON- function   ,   and this shape be maintain by many different type of chemical bond   .
change in temperature   ,   ph   ,   and exposure to chemical may lead to permanent change in the shape of the protein   ,   lead to loss of function   ,   know as denaturation   .
all protein be make up of different arrangement of the same   two   zero   type of amino acid   .
amino acid be the monomer that make up protein   .
each amino acid have the same fundamental structure   ,   which consist of a central carbon atom   ,   also know as the alpha   (   α   )   carbon   ,   bond to an amino group   (   nh two    )    ,   a carboxyl group   (   cooh   )    ,   and to a hydrogen atom   .
every amino acid also have another atom or group of atom bond to the central atom know as the r group   (   figure   three    .    two   two    )    .   the name   "   amino acid   "   be derive from the fact that -PRON- contain both amino group and carboxyl   -   acid   -   group in -PRON- basic structure   .
as mention   ,   there be   two   zero   amino acid present in protein   .
ten of these be consider essential amino acid in human because the human body can not produce -PRON- and -PRON- be obtain from the diet   .
for each amino acid   ,   the r group   (   or side chain   )   be different   (   figure   three    .    two   three    )    .   the chemical nature of the side chain determine the nature of the amino acid   (   that be   ,   whether -PRON- be acidic   ,   basic   ,   polar   ,   or nonpolar   )    .   for example   ,   the amino acid glycine have a hydrogen atom as the r group   .
amino acid such as valine   ,   methionine   ,   and alanine be nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature   ,   while amino acid such as serine   ,   threonine   ,   and cysteine be polar and have hydrophilic side chain   .
the side chain of lysine and arginine be positively charge   ,   and therefore these amino acid be also know as basic amino acid   .
proline have an r group that be link to the amino group   ,   form a ring   -   like structure   .
proline be an exception to the standard structure of an animo acid since -PRON- amino group be not separate from the side chain   (   figure   three    .    two   three    )    .   amino acid be represent by a single upper case letter or a three   -   letter abbreviation   .
for example   ,   valine be know by the letter v or the three   -   letter symbol val   .
just as some fatty acid be essential to a diet   ,   some amino acid be necessary as well   .
-PRON- be know as essential amino acid   ,   and in human -PRON- include isoleucine   ,   leucine   ,   and cysteine   .
essential amino acid refer to those necessary for construction of protein in the body   ,   although not produce by the body    which amino acid be essential varie from organism to organism   .
the sequence and the number of amino acid ultimately determine the protein   '   s shape   ,   size   ,   and function   .
each amino acid be attach to another amino acid by a covalent bond   ,   know as a peptide bond   ,   which be form by a dehydration reaction   .
the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine   ,   release a molecule of water   .
the result bond be the peptide bond   (   figure   three    .    two   four    )    .   the product form by such linkage be call peptide   .
as more amino acid join to this grow chain   ,   the result chain be know as a polypeptide   .
each polypeptide have a free amino group at one end   .
this end be call the n terminal   ,   or the amino terminal   ,   and the other end have a free carboxyl group   ,   also know as the c or carboxyl terminal   .
while the term polypeptide and protein be sometimes use interchangeably   ,   a polypeptide be technically a polymer of amino acid   ,   whereas the term protein be use for a polypeptide or polypeptide that have combine together   ,   often have bind non   -   peptide prosthetic group   ,   have a distinct shape   ,   and have a unique function   .
after protein synthesis   (   translation   )    ,   most protein be modify   .
these be know as post   -   translational modification   .
-PRON- may undergo cleavage   ,   phosphorylation   ,   or may require the addition of other chemical group   .
only after these modification be the protein completely functional   .
as discuss earlier   ,   the shape of a protein be critical to -PRON- function   .
for example   ,   an enzyme can bind to a specific substrate at a site know as the active site   .
if this active site be alter because of local change or change in overall protein structure   ,   the enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate   .
to understand how the protein get -PRON- final shape or conformation   ,   -PRON- need to understand the four level of protein structure    primary   ,   secondary   ,   tertiary   ,   and quaternary   .
the unique sequence of amino acid in a polypeptide chain be -PRON- primary structure   .
for example   ,   the pancreatic hormone insulin have two polypeptide chain   ,   a and b   ,   and -PRON- be link together by disulfide bond   .
the n terminal amino acid of the a chain be glycine   ,   whereas the c terminal amino acid be asparagine   (   figure   three    .    two   five    )    .   the sequence of amino acid in the a and b chain be unique to insulin   .
the unique sequence for every protein be ultimately determine by the gene encode the protein   .
a change in nucleotide sequence of the gene ' s cod region may lead to a different amino acid be add to the grow polypeptide chain   ,   cause a change in protein structure and function   .
in sickle cell anemia   ,   the hemoglobin β chain   (   a small portion of which be show in figure   three    .    two   six    )   have a single amino acid substitution   ,   cause a change in protein structure and function   .
specifically   ,   the amino acid glutamic acid be substitute by valine in the β chain   .
what be most remarkable to consider be that a hemoglobin molecule be make up of two alpha chain and two beta chain that each consist of about   one   five   zero   amino acid   .
the molecule   ,   therefore   ,   have about   six   zero   zero   amino acid   .
the structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule -- which dramatically decrease life expectancy -- be a single amino acid of the   six   zero   zero    .
what be even more remarkable be that those   six   zero   zero   amino acid be encode by three nucleotide each   ,   and the mutation be cause by a single base change   (   point mutation   )    ,    one   in   one   eight   zero   zero   base   .
because of this change of one amino acid in the chain   ,   hemoglobin molecule form long fiber that distort the biconcave   ,   or disc   -   shape   ,   red blood cell and assume a crescent or " sickle " shape   ,   which clog artery   (   figure   three    .    two   seven    )    .   this can lead to myriad serious health problem such as breathlessness   ,   dizziness   ,   headache   ,   and abdominal pain for those affect by this disease   .
the local folding of the polypeptide in some region give rise to the secondary structure of the protein   .
the most common be the α   -   helix and β   -   pleated sheet structure   (   figure   three    .    two   eight    )    .   both structure be the α   -   helix structure -- the helix hold in shape by hydrogen bond   .
the hydrogen bond form between the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group in one amino acid and another amino acid that be four amino acid farther along the chain   .
every helical turn in an alpha helix have   three    .    six   amino acid residue   .
the r group   (   the variant group   )   of the polypeptide protrude out from the α   -   helix chain   .
in the β   -   pleated sheet   ,   the " pleat " be form by hydrogen bonding between atom on the backbone of the polypeptide chain   .
the r group be attach to the carbon and extend above and below the fold of the pleat   .
the pleated segment align parallel or antiparallel to each other   ,   and hydrogen bond form between the partially positive nitrogen atom in the amino group and the partially negative oxygen atom in the carbonyl group of the peptide backbone   .
the α   -   helix and β   -   pleated sheet structure be find in most globular and fibrous protein and -PRON- play an important structural role   .
the unique three   -   dimensional structure of a polypeptide be -PRON- tertiary structure   (   figure   three    .    two   nine    )    .   this structure be in part due to chemical interaction at work on the polypeptide chain   .
primarily   ,   the interaction among r group create the complex three   -   dimensional tertiary structure of a protein   .
the nature of the r group find in the amino acid involve can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bond describe for standard secondary structure   .
for example   ,   r group with like charge be repel by each other and those with unlike charge be attract to each other   (   ionic bond   )    .   when protein fold take place   ,   the hydrophobic r group of nonpolar amino acid lie in the interior of the protein   ,   whereas the hydrophilic r group lie on the outside   .
the former type of interaction be also know as hydrophobic interaction   .
interaction between cysteine side chain form disulfide linkage in the presence of oxygen   ,   the only covalent bond form during protein fold   .
all of these interaction   ,   weak and strong   ,   determine the final three   -   dimensional shape of the protein   .
when a protein lose -PRON- three   -   dimensional shape   ,   -PRON- may no longer be functional   .
in nature   ,   some protein be form from several polypeptide   ,   also know as subunit   ,   and the interaction of these subunit form the quaternary structure   .
weak interaction between the subunit help to stabilize the overall structure   .
for example   ,   insulin   (   a globular protein   )   have a combination of hydrogen bond and disulfide bond that because -PRON- to be mostly clump into a ball shape   .
insulin start out as a single polypeptide and lose some internal sequence in the presence of post   -   translational modification after the formation of the disulfide linkage that hold the remain chain together   .
silk   (   a fibrous protein   )    ,   however   ,   have a β   -   pleated sheet structure that be the result of hydrogen bonding between different chain   .
the four level of protein structure   (   primary   ,   secondary   ,   tertiary   ,   and quaternary   )   be illustrate in figure   three    .    three   zero    .
each protein have -PRON- own unique sequence and shape that be hold together by chemical interaction   .
if the protein be subject to change in temperature   ,   ph   ,   or exposure to chemical   ,   the protein structure may change   ,   lose -PRON- shape without lose -PRON- primary sequence in what be know as denaturation   .
denaturation be often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide be conserve in the process if the denature agent be remove   ,   allow the protein to resume -PRON- function   .
sometimes denaturation be irreversible   ,   lead to loss of function   .
one example of irreversible protein denaturation be when an egg be fry   .
the albumin protein in the liquid egg white be denature when place in a hot pan   .
not all protein be denature at high temperature    for instance   ,   bacteria that survive in hot spring have protein that function at temperature close to boil   .
the stomach be also very acidic   ,   have a low ph   ,   and denature protein as part of the digestion process    however   ,   the digestive enzyme of the stomach retain -PRON- activity under these condition   .
protein folding be critical to -PRON- function   .
-PRON- be originally think that the protein -PRON- be responsible for the fold process   .
only recently be -PRON- find that often -PRON- receive assistance in the folding process from protein helper know as chaperone   (   or chaperonin   )   that associate with the target protein during the folding process   .
-PRON- act by prevent aggregation of polypeptide that make up the complete protein structure   ,   and -PRON- disassociate from the protein once the target protein be fold   .
nucleic acid be the most important macromolecule for the continuity of life   .
-PRON- carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and carry instruction for the functioning of the cell   .
the two main type of nucleic acid be deoxyribonucleic acid   (   dna   )   and ribonucleic acid   (   rna   )    .   dna be the genetic material find in all live organism   ,   range from single   -   cell bacteria to multicellular mammal   .
-PRON- be find in the nucleus of eukaryote and in the organelle   ,   chloroplast   ,   and mitochondria   .
in prokaryote   ,   the dna be not enclose in a membranous envelope   .
the entire genetic content of a cell be know as -PRON- genome   ,   and the study of genome be genomic   .
in eukaryotic cell but not in prokaryote   ,   dna form a complex with histone protein to form chromatin   ,   the substance of eukaryotic chromosome   .
a chromosome may contain ten of thousand of gene   .
many gene contain the information to make protein product    other gene code for rna product   .
dna control all of the cellular activity by turn the gene " on " or " off   .
" the other type of nucleic acid   ,   rna   ,   be mostly involve in protein synthesis   .
the dna molecule never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell   .
this intermediary be the messenger rna   (   mrna   )    .   other type of rna -- like rrna   ,   trna   ,   and microrna -- be involve in protein synthesis and -PRON- regulation   .
dna and rna be make up of monomer know as nucleotide   .
the nucleotide combine with each other to form a polynucleotide   ,   dna or rna   .
each nucleotide be make up of three component    a nitrogenous base   ,   a pentose   (   five   -   carbon   )   sugar   ,   and a phosphate group   (   figure   three    .    three   one    )    .   each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide be attach to a sugar molecule   ,   which be attach to one or more phosphate group   .
the nitrogenous base   ,   important component of nucleotide   ,   be organic molecule and be so name because -PRON- contain carbon and nitrogen   .
-PRON- be base because -PRON- contain an amino group that have the potential of bind an extra hydrogen   ,   and thus   ,   decrease the hydrogen ion concentration in -PRON- environment   ,   make -PRON- more basic   .
each nucleotide in dna contain one of four possible nitrogenous base    adenine   (   a   )    ,   guanine   (   g   )   cytosine   (   c   )    ,   and thymine   (   t   )    .   adenine and guanine be classify as purine   .
the primary structure of a purine be two carbon   -   nitrogen ring   .
cytosine   ,   thymine   ,   and uracil be classify as pyrimidine which have a single carbon   -   nitrogen ring as -PRON- primary structure   (   figure   three    .    three   one    )    .   each of these basic carbon   -   nitrogen ring have different functional group attach to -PRON-   .
in molecular biology shorthand   ,   the nitrogenous base be simply know by -PRON- symbol a   ,   t   ,   g   ,   c   ,   and u   .   dna contain a   ,   t   ,   g   ,   and c whereas rna contain a   ,   u   ,   g   ,   and c   .   the pentose sugar in dna be deoxyribose   ,   and in rna   ,   the sugar be ribose   (   figure   three    .    three   one    )    .   the difference between the sugar be the presence of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the ribose and hydrogen on the second carbon of the deoxyribose   .
the carbon atom of the sugar molecule be number as   one   ′   ,    two   ′   ,    three   ′   ,    four   ′   ,   and   five   ′   (    one   ′ be read as " one prime "   )    .   the phosphate residue be attach to the hydroxyl group of the   five   ′ carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the   three   ′ carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide   ,   which form a   five   ′ –   three   ′ phosphodiester linkage   .
the phosphodiester linkage be not form by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkage connect monomer in macromolecule    -PRON- formation involve the removal of two phosphate group   .
a polynucleotide may have thousand of such phosphodiester linkage   .
dna have a double   -   helix structure   (   figure   three    .    three   two    )    .   the sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix   ,   form the backbone of the dna   .
the nitrogenous base be stack in the interior   ,   like the step of a staircase   ,   in pair    the pair be bind to each other by hydrogen bond   .
every base pair in the double helivx be separate from the next base pair by   zero    .    three   four   nm   .
the two strand of the helix run in opposite direction   ,   mean that the   five   ′ carbon end of one strand will face the   three   ′ carbon end of -PRON- matching strand   .    (   this be refer to as antiparallel orientation and be important to dna replication and in many nucleic acid interaction   .    )   only certain type of base pairing be allow   .
for example   ,   a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine   .
this mean a can pair with t   ,   and g can pair with c   ,   as show in figure   three    .    three   three    .
this be know as the base complementary rule   .
in other word   ,   the dna strand be complementary to each other   .
if the sequence of one strand be aattggcc   ,   the complementary strand would have the sequence ttaaccgg   .
during dna replication   ,   each strand be copy   ,   result in a daughter dna double helix contain one parental dna strand and a newly synthesize strand   .
ribonucleic acid   ,   or rna   ,   be mainly involve in the process of protein synthesis under the direction of dna   .
rna be usually single   -   strand and be make of ribonucleotide that be link by phosphodiester bond   .
a ribonucleotide in the rna chain contain ribose   (   the pentose sugar   )    ,   one of the four nitrogenous base   (   a   ,   u   ,   g   ,   and c   )    ,   and the phosphate group   .
there be four major type of rna    messenger rna   (   mrna   )    ,   ribosomal rna   (   rrna   )    ,   transfer rna   (   trna   )    ,   and microrna   (   mirna   )    .   the first   ,   mrna   ,   carry the message from dna   ,   which control all of the cellular activity in a cell   .
if a cell require a certain protein to be synthesize   ,   the gene for this product be turn " on " and the messenger rna be synthesize in the nucleus   .
the rna base sequence be complementary to the cod sequence of the dna from which -PRON- have be copy   .
however   ,   in rna   ,   the base t be absent and u be present instead   .
if the dna strand have a sequence aattgcgc   ,   the sequence of the complementary rna be uuaacgcg   .
in the cytoplasm   ,   the mrna interact with ribosome and other cellular machinery   (   figure   three    .    three   four    )    .   the mrna be read in set of three base know as codon   .
each codon code for a single amino acid   .
in this way   ,   the mrna be read and the protein product be make   .
ribosomal rna   (   rrna   )   be a major constituent of ribosome on which the mrna bind   .
the rrna ensure the proper alignment of the mrna and the ribosome    the rrna of the ribosome also have an enzymatic activity   (   peptidyl transferase   )   and catalyze the formation of the peptide bond between two aligned amino acid   .
transfer rna   (   trna   )   be one of the small of the four type of rna   ,   usually   seven   zero   –   nine   zero   nucleotide long   .
-PRON- carry the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis   .
-PRON- be the base pair between the trna and mrna that allow for the correct amino acid to be insert in the polypeptide chain   .   microrna be the small rna molecule and -PRON- role involve the regulation of gene expression by interfere with the expression of certain mrna message   .
table   three    .    two   summarize feature of dna and rna   .
even though the rna be single strand   ,   most rna type show extensive intramolecular base pair between complementary sequence   ,   create a predictable three   -   dimensional structure essential for -PRON- function   .
as -PRON- have learn   ,   information flow in an organism take place from dna to rna to protein   .
dna dictate the structure of mrna in a process know as transcription   ,   and rna dictate the structure of protein in a process know as translation   .
this be know as the central dogma of life   ,   which hold true for all organism    however   ,   exception to the rule occur in connection with viral infection   .
protein   ,   carbohydrate   ,   nucleic acid   ,   and lipid be the four major class of biological macromolecule -- large molecule necessary for life that be build from small organic molecule   .
macromolecule be make up of single unit know as monomer that be join by covalent bond to form large polymer   .
the polymer be more than the sum of -PRON- part    -PRON- acquire new characteristic   ,   and lead to an osmotic pressure that be much low than that form by -PRON- ingredient    this be an important advantage in the maintenance of cellular osmotic condition   .
a monomer join with another monomer with the release of a water molecule   ,   lead to the formation of a covalent bond   .
these type of reaction be know as dehydration or condensation reaction   .
when polymer be break down into small unit   (   monomer   )    ,   a molecule of water be use for each bond break by these reaction    such reaction be know as hydrolysis reaction   .
dehydration and hydrolysis reaction be similar for all macromolecule   ,   but each monomer and polymer reaction be specific to -PRON- class   .
dehydration reaction typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation   ,   while hydrolysis reaction typically release energy by break bond   .
carbohydrate be a group of macromolecule that be a vital energy source for the cell and provide structural support to plant cell   ,   fungus   ,   and all of the arthropod that include lobster   ,   crab   ,   shrimp   ,   insect   ,   and spider   .
carbohydrate be classify as monosaccharide   ,   disaccharide   ,   and polysaccharide depend on the number of monomer in the molecule   .
monosaccharide be link by glycosidic bond that be form as a result of dehydration reaction   ,   form disaccharide and polysaccharide with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond form   .
glucose   ,   galactose   ,   and fructose be common monosaccharide   ,   whereas common disaccharide include lactose   ,   maltose   ,   and sucrose   .

the long polysaccharide chain may be branched or unbranched   .
cellulose be an example of an unbranched polysaccharide   ,   whereas amylopectin   ,   a constituent of starch   ,   be a highly branched molecule   .
storage of glucose   ,   in the form of polymer like starch of glycogen   ,   make -PRON- slightly less accessible for metabolism    however   ,   this prevent -PRON- from leak out of the cell or create a high osmotic pressure that could because excessive water uptake by the cell   .
lipid be a class of macromolecule that be nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature   .
major type include fat and oil   ,   wax   ,   phospholipid   ,   and steroid   .
fat be a store form of energy and be also know as triacylglycerol or triglyceride   .
fat be make up of fatty acid and either glycerol or sphingosine   .
fatty acid may be unsaturated or saturate   ,   depend on the presence or absence of double bond in the hydrocarbon chain   .
if only single bond be present   ,   -PRON- be know as saturate fatty acid   .
unsaturated fatty acid may have one or more double bond in the hydrocarbon chain   .
phospholipid make up the matrix of membrane   .

the overall three   -   dimensional structure be the tertiary structure   .
when two or more polypeptide combine to form the complete protein structure   ,   the configuration be know as the quaternary structure of a protein   .
protein shape and function be intricately link    any change in shape cause by change in temperature or ph may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function   .
nucleic acid be molecule make up of nucleotide that direct cellular activity such as cell division and protein synthesis   .
each nucleotide be make up of a pentose sugar   ,   a nitrogenous base   ,   and a phosphate group   .
there be two type of nucleic acid    dna and rna   .
dna carry the genetic blueprint of the cell and be pass on from parent to offspring   (   in the form of chromosome   )    .   -PRON- have a double   -   helical structure with the two strand run in opposite direction   ,   connect by hydrogen bond   ,   and complementary to each other   .
rna be single   -   strand and be make of a pentose sugar   (   ribose   )    ,   a nitrogenous base   ,   and a phosphate group   .
rna be involve in protein synthesis and -PRON- regulation   .
