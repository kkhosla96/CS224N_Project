You are what you eat—and that is recorded inyour hair.” Two scientists at the University ofUtah are responsible for adding the last phraseto this famous saying about body chemistry. Ecologist JimEhleringer and chemist Thure Cerling showed that thecomposition of human hair reflects the region where aperson lives.As we pointed out in Chapter 1, living things are madeup of the same kinds of atoms that make up the inanimateuniverse. Two of those atoms are hydrogen (H) andoxygen (O), which combine to form water (H2O). Bothatoms have naturally occurring variants called isotopes,which have the same chemical properties but differentweights because their nuclei have different numbers ofparticles called neutrons.When water evaporates from the ocean, it forms cloudsthat move inland and release rain. Water made up of theheavier H and O isotopes is heavier and tends to fall morereadily than water containing the lighter isotopes. Warmrains tend to be heavier than cooler precipitation. Peopleliving on the coast or in regions where there are frequentwarm rains consume heavier water and foods made fromwater than people living in cooler, inland areas (assuming,of course, that their beverages and produce come fromthe same area they live in). And, since you are what youeat, the heavy H and O atoms become part of their bodies.Our hair contains abundant H and O atoms, many obtainedfrom local water. Ehleringer and Cerling wonderedwhether the ratios of heavy-to-light H and O in hair reflectedthe ratio of heavy-to-light H2O in the local water. Toaddress this question, Ehleringer’s wife and Cerling’s childrenand their friends went on a hair-collecting trip acrossthe United States, collecting hair trimmings from barbershopfloors while at the same time filling test tubes with localwater. Back at the lab, scientists tested the samples andfound that the ratios of heavy to light isotopes in the hairdid indeed reflect these same ratios in the local water.While this information is intrinsically fascinating, it isalso potentially useful. For example, police could use hairanalysis to evaluate a suspect’s alibi: “You say you’ve beenin Montana for the past month? Your hair sample indicatesthat you were in a warm coastal area.” Such conflictingevidence could form the basis of further investigation.A hairy story2Hair Tells a Tale The ratio in hair protein of the heavy isotope18O to its lighter counterpart 16O reflects the ratios in local water.How Does Atomic Structure Explain 2.1 the Properties of Matter?All matter is composed of atoms. Atoms are tiny—more thana trillion (1012) of them could fit on top of the period at the endof this sentence. Each atom consists of a dense, positivelycharged nucleus, around which one or more negatively chargedelectrons move (Figure 2.1). The nucleus contains one or morepositively charged protons and may contain one or more neutronswith no electrical charge. Atoms and their component particleshave volume and mass, which are characteristics of allmatter. Mass is a measure of the quantity of matter present; thegreater the mass, the greater the quantity of matter.The mass of a proton serves as a standard unit of measurecalled the dalton (named after the English chemist John Dalton)or atomic mass unit (amu). A single proton or neutron has amass of about 1 dalton (Da), which is 1.7 × 10–24 grams(0.0000000000000000000000017 g). That’s tiny, but an electron iseven tinier at 9 × 10–28 g (0.0005 Da). Because the mass of an electronis negligible compared with the mass of a proton or a neutron,the contribution of electrons to the mass of an atom canusually be ignored when measurements and calculations aremade. It is electrons, however, that determine how atoms willcombine with other atoms to form stable associations.Each proton has a positive electric charge, defined as +1 unitof charge. An electron has a negative charge equal and oppositeto that of a proton (–1). The neutron, as its name suggests,is electrically neutral, so its charge is 0. Charges that are different(+/–) attract each other, whereas charges that are alike (+/+,–/–) repel each other. Atoms are electrically neutral because thenumber of electrons in an atom equals the number of protons.An element consists of only one kind of atomAn element is a pure substance that contains only one kind ofatom. The element hydrogen consists only of hydrogen atoms;the element iron consists only of iron atoms. The atoms of eachelement have certain characteristics or properties that distinguishthem from the atoms of other elements. These propertiesinclude their mass and how they interact and associate withother atoms.The more than 100 elements found in the universe arearranged in the periodic table (Figure 2.2). Each element has itsown one- or two-letter chemical symbol. For example, H standsfor hydrogen, C for carbon, and O for oxygen. Some symbolscome from other languages: Fe (from the Latin, ferrum) standsfor iron, Na (Latin, natrium) for sodium, and W (German, wolfram)for tungsten.IN THIS CHAPTER we will introduce the constituentsof matter: atoms, their variety, their properties, and their capacityto combine with other atoms. We will consider howmatter changes, including changes in state (solid to liquidto gas), and changes caused by chemical reactions. We willexamine the structure and properties of water and its relationshipto chemical acids and bases.Or anthropologists might analyze hair samples fromgraves to work out migration patterns of human groups.The understanding that life is based on chemistry andobeys universal laws of chemistry and physics is relativelynew in human history. Until the nineteenth century,a “vital force” (from the Latin vitalis, “of life”) waspresumed be responsible for life. This vital force wasseen as distinct from the mechanistic forces governingphysics and chemistry. Many people still assume that avital force exists, but the physical–chemical view of lifehas led to great advances in biological science and is thecornerstone of modern medicine and agriculture.CHAPTER OUTLINE2.1 How Does Atomic Structure Explain the Propertiesof Matter?2.2 How Do Atoms Bond to Form Molecules?2.3 How Do Atoms Change Partners in ChemicalReactions?2.4 What Makes Water So Important for Life?Free Samples Need hair samples for a research project?Try the local barber shop.The elements of the periodic table are not found in equalamounts. Stars have abundant amounts of hydrogen and helium.Earth’s crust, and the surfaces of the neighboring planets,are almost half oxygen, 28 percent silicon, 8 percent aluminum,and between 2 and 5 percent each of sodium, magnesium,potassium, calcium, and iron. They contain much smalleramounts of the other elements.About 98 percent of the mass of every living organism (bacterium,turnip, or human) is composed of just six elements: carbon,hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Thechemistry of these six elements will be our primary concern inthis chapter, but other elements found in living organisms areimportant as well. Sodium and potassium, for example, are essentialfor nerve function; calcium can act as a biological signal;iodine is a component of a vital hormone; and magnesium isbound to chlorophyll in plants. The physical and chemical (reactive)properties of atoms depend on the number of subatomicparticles they contain.Each element has a different number of protonsAn element differs from other elements by the number of protonsin the nucleus of each of its atoms; the number of protonsis designated the atomic number. This atomic number is unique22 CHAPTER 2 | SMALL MOLECULES AND THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE––++Each proton has a massof 1 and a positive charge.Each neutron has a massof 1 and no charge.Each electron has negligiblemass and a negative charge.Nucleus2.1 The Helium Atom This representation of a helium atom is called aBohr model. It exaggerates the space occupied by the nucleus. In reality,although the nucleus accounts for virtually all of the atomic mass, it occupiesonly about 1/10,000 of the atom’s volume. The Bohr model is alsoinaccurate in that it represents the electron as a discrete particle in adefined orbit around the nucleus.Elements in the same verticalcolumns have similar propertiesbecause they have the same numberof electrons in their outermost shell.Elements highlighted inorange are present in smallamounts in many organisms.The six elements highlighted inyellow make up 98% of themass of most living organisms.Masses in parentheses indicate unstable elementsthat decay rapidly to form other elements.Elements without a chemicalsymbol are as yet unnamed.Atomic number(number of protons)Chemical symbol(for helium)Atomic mass(number of protons plusnumber of neutrons)1H1.00793Li6.9414Be9.01211Na22.99012Mg24.30520Ca40.0819K39.09821Sc44.95622Ti47.8823V50.94224Cr51.99625Mn54.93826Fe55.8472He4.0037N14.0078O15.99915P30.97416S32.0629Cu63.54630Zn65.3831Ga69.7232Ge72.5933As74.92234Se78.9635Br79.90936Kr83.809F18.99810Ne20.17917Cl35.45318Ar39.94827Co58.93328Ni58.695B10.816C12.01113Al26.98214Si28.08637Rb85.477838Sr87.6239Y88.90640Zr91.2241Nb92.90642Mo95.9443Tc(99)44Ru101.0747Ag107.87048Cd112.4149In114.8250Sn118.6951Sb121.7552Te127.6053I126.90454Xe131.3045Rh102.90646Pd106.455Cs132.90556Ba137.3472Hf178.4973Ta180.94874W183.85104Rf(261)105Db(262)106Sg(266)107Bh(264)108Hs(269)109Mt(268)110(269)111(272)112(277)113 114(285)115(289)116 117 118(293)75Re186.20776Os190.279Au196.96780Hg200.5981Tl204.3782Pb207.1983Bi208.98084Po(209)85At(210)86Rn(222)77Ir192.278Pt195.0887Fr(223)88Ra226.02558Ce140.1259Pr140.907760Nd144.2461Pm(145)64Gd157.2565Tb158.92466Dy162.5067Ho164.93068Er167.2669Tm168.93470Yb173.0462Sm150.3663Eu151.9690Th232.03857La138.90689Ac227.02891Pa231.035992U238.0293Np237.048296Cm(247)97Bk(247)98Cf(251)99Es(252)100Fm(257)101Md(258)102No(259)71Lu174.9794Pu(244)95Am(243)Lanthanide seriesActinide series103Lr(260)2He4.003––++2.2 The Periodic Table The periodic table groups theelements according to their physical and chemical properties.Elements 1–92 occur in nature; elements with atomicnumbers above 92 were created in the laboratory.to each element and does not change. The atomic number of heliumis 2, and an atom of helium always has two protons; theatomic number of oxygen is 8, and an atom of oxygen alwayshas eight protons.Along with a definitive number of protons, every elementexcept hydrogen has one or more neutrons in its nucleus. Themass number of an atom is the total number of protons and neutronsin its nucleus. The nucleus of a carbon atom contains sixprotons and six neutrons, and has a mass number of 12. Oxygenhas eight protons and eight neutrons, and has a mass numberof 16. The mass number is essentially the mass of the atomin daltons (see below).By convention, we often print the symbol for an element withthe atomic number at the lower left and the mass number at theupper left, both immediately preceding the symbol. Thus hydrogen,carbon, and oxygen can be written as 11H, 126 C, and 168 O,respectively.The number of neutrons differs among isotopesIn some elements, the number of neutrons in the atomic nucleusis not always the same. Different isotopes of the same elementhave the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons.Many elements have several isotopes. The isotopes of hydrogenshown below have special names, but the isotopes ofmost elements do not have distinct names.The natural isotopes of carbon, for example, are 12C (six neutronsin the nucleus), 13C (seven neutrons), and 14C (eight neutrons).Note that all three (called “carbon-12,” “carbon-13,” and“carbon-14”) have six protons, so they are all carbon. Most carbonatoms are 12C, about 1.1 percent are 13C, and a tiny fractionare 14C. But all have virtually the same chemical reactivity,which is an important property for their use in experimentalbiology and medicine. An element’s atomic weight (or atomicmass) is the average of the mass numbers of a representativesample of atoms of that element, with all the isotopes in theirnormally occurring proportions. The atomic weight of carbon,taking into account all of its isotopes and their abundances, isthus 12.011. The fractional atomic weight results from averagingthe contributing weights of all of the isotopes.Most isotopes are stable. But some, called radioisotopes, areunstable and spontaneously give off energy in the form of α (alpha),β (beta), or γ (gamma) radiation from the atomic nucleus.Known as radioactive decay, this release of energy transforms theoriginal atom. The type of transformation varies depending onthe radioisotope, but some can change the number of protons,so that the original atom becomes a different element.With sensitive instruments, scientists can use the released radiationto detect the presence of radioisotopes. For instance, ifan earthworm is given food containing a radioisotope, its paththrough the soil can be followed using a simple detector calleda Geiger counter. Most atoms in living organisms are organizedinto stable associations called molecules. If a radioisotope is incorporatedinto a molecule, it acts as a tag or label, allowingresearchers or physicians to trace the molecule in an experimentor in the body (Figure 2.3). Radioisotopes are also used to datefossils, an application described in Section 25.1.Although radioisotopes are useful in research and in medicine,even a low dose of the radiation they emit has the potentialto damage molecules and cells. However, these damagingeffects are sometimes used to our advantage; for example, theradiation from 60Co (cobalt-60) is used in medicine to kill cancercells.The behavior of electrons determines chemicalbonding and geometryThe characteristic number of electrons in an atom determineshow it will combine with other atoms. Biologists are interestedin how chemical changes take place in living cells. When consideringatoms, they are concerned primarily with electrons becausethe behavior of electrons explains how chemical reactionsoccur. Chemical reactions alter the atomic compositions of substancesand thus alter their properties. Reactions usually involvechanges in the distribution of electrons between atoms.The location of a given electron in an atom at any given timeis impossible to determine. We can only describe a volume ofspace within the atom where the electron is likely to be. Theregion of space where the electron is found at least 90 percentof the time is the electron’s orbital. Orbitals have characteristicshapes and orientations, and a given orbital can be occupied by–+–+–+Hydrogen Deuterium Tritium1 proton1 neutron1 proton0 neutrons1 proton2 neutrons1H 2H 3H 1 1 12.1 | HOW DOES ATOMIC STRUCTURE EXPLAIN THE PROPERTIES OF MATTER? 23ComparisonsubjectMethamphetamineabuser ActivitylevelHighLow2.3 Tagging the Brain In these images from live people, a radioactivelylabeled sugar is used to detect differences between the brain activity ofa healthy person and that of a person who abuses methamphetamines.The more active a brain region is, the more sugar it takes up.

Thus any atom largerthan helium (atomic number 2) must have electrons in two ormore orbitals. As we move from lighter to heavier atoms inthe periodic chart, the orbitals are filled in a specific sequence,in a series of what are known as electron shells, or energy levels,around the nucleus.• First shell: The innermost electron shell consists of just oneorbital, called an s orbital. Ahydrogen atom (1H) has oneelectron in its first shell; helium (2He) has two. Atoms of allother elements have two or more shells to accommodate orbitalsfor additional electrons.• Second shell: The second shell contains four orbitals (an s orbitaland three p orbitals), and hence holds up to eight electrons.As depicted in Figure 2.4, the s orbitals have theshape of a sphere, while the p orbitals are directed at rightangles to one another. The orientations of these orbitals inspace contribute to the three-dimensional shapes of moleculeswhen atoms link to other atoms.24 CHAPTER 2 | SMALL MOLECULES AND THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFEFirst shell:The two electrons closestto the nucleus move in aspherical s orbital.Second shell:Two electrons occupy the 2s orbital, one of fourorbitals in the second shell of electrons.

The s orbitals have a lower energy level and fill with electronsbefore the p orbitals do.2.5 Electron Shells Determine the Reactivity of Atoms Each shellcan hold a specific maximum number of electrons. Each shell must be filledbefore electrons can occupy the next shell. The energy level of an electronis higher in a shell farther from the nucleus. An atom with unpaired electronsin its outermost shell can react (bond) with other atoms.GO TO Web Activity 2.1 • Electron OrbitalsyourBioPortal.com• Additional shells: Elements with more than ten electronshave three or more electron shells. The farther a shell isfrom the nucleus, the higher the energy level is for an electronoccupying that shell.The s orbitals fill with electrons first, and their electrons havethe lowest energy level. Subsequent shells have different numbersof orbitals, but the outermost shells usually hold only eightelectrons. In any atom, the outermost electron shell (the valenceshell) determines how the atom combines with otheratoms—that is, how the atom behaves chemically. When a valenceshell with four orbitals contains eight electrons, there areno unpaired electrons, and the atom is stable—it will not reactwith other atoms (Figure 2.5). Examples of chemically stable elementsare helium, neon, and argon. On the other hand, atomsthat have one or more unpaired electrons in their outer shellsare capable of reacting with other atoms.Atoms with unpaired electrons (i.e., partially filled orbitals)in their outermost electron shells are unstable, and will undergoreactions in order to fill their outermost shells. Reactive atoms canattain stability either by sharing electrons with other atoms or bylosing or gaining one or more electrons. In either case, the atomsinvolved are bonded together into stable associations called molecules.The tendency of atoms to form stable molecules so that theyhave eight electrons in their outermost shells is known as the octetrule. Many atoms in biologically important molecules—for example,carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)—follow this rule. An importantexception is hydrogen (H), which attains stability when two electronsoccupy its single shell (consisting of just one s orbital).2.1 RECAPThe living world is composed of the same set ofchemical elements as the rest of the universe. Anatom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons,and a characteristic configuration of electrons in orbitalsaround the nucleus. This structure determinesthe atom’s chemical properties.• Describe the arrangement of protons, neutrons, andelectrons in an atom. See Figure 2.1• Use the periodic table to identify some of the similaritiesand differences in atomic structure among differentelements (for example, oxygen, carbon, and helium).How does the configuration of the valence shellinfluence the placement of an element in the periodictable? See p. 25 and Figures 2.2 and 2.5• How does bonding help a reactive atom achievestability? See p. 25 and Figure 2.5We have introduced the individual players on the biochemicalstage—the atoms. We have shown how the energy levels of electronsdrive an atomic “quest for stability.” Next we will describethe different types of chemical bonds that can lead to stability,joining atoms together into molecular structures with hosts ofdifferent properties.How Do Atoms Bond to 2.2 Form Molecules?A chemical bond is an attractive force that links two atoms togetherin a molecule. There are several kinds of chemical bonds(Table 2.1). In this section we will begin with covalent bonds, thestrong bonds that result from the sharing of electrons. Next wewill examine ionic bonds, which form when an atom gains orloses one or more electrons to achieve stability. We will then considerother, weaker, kinds of interactions, including hydrogenbonds, which are enormously important to biology.Covalent bonds consist of shared pairs of electronsA covalent bond forms when two atoms attain stable electronnumbers in their outermost shells by sharing one or more pairsof electrons. Consider two hydrogen atoms coming into closeproximity, each with an unpaired electron in its single shell (Figure2.6). When the electrons pair up, a stable association isformed, and this links the two hydrogen atoms in a covalentbond, resulting in H2.Acompound is a substance made up of molecules with twoor more elements bonded together in a fixed ratio. Methane gas(CH4), water (H2O), and table sugar (sucrose, C12H22O11) are examplesof compounds. The chemical symbols identify the differentelements in a compound, and the subscript numbers indicatehow many atoms of each element are present. Everycompound has a molecular weight (molecular mass) that is the2.2 | HOW DO ATOMS BOND TO FORM MOLECULES? 25Each electron isattracted to theother atom’snucleus……but thenucleus stillattracts itsown electron.The atoms movecloser togetherand share theelectron pair ina covalent bond.Hydrogenmolecule (H2)Hydrogen atoms (2 H)HHHHHHCovalentbond2.6 Electrons Are Shared in Covalent Bonds Two hydrogen atomscan combine to form a hydrogen molecule.

Lookingat the periodic table in Figure 2.2, you can calculate the molecularweights of the three compounds listed above to be 16.04,18.01, and 342.29, respectively. Molecules that make up livingorganisms range in molecular weight from two to half a billion,and covalent bonds are common to all.How are covalent bonds formed in a molecule of methanegas (CH4)? The carbon atom in this compound has six electrons:two electrons fill its inner shell, and four unpaired electronstravel in its outer shell. Because its outer shell can hold up toeight electrons, carbon can share electrons with up to four otheratoms—it can form four covalent bonds (Figure 2.7A). When anatom of carbon reacts with four hydrogen atoms, methaneforms. Thanks to electron sharing, the outer shell of methane’scarbon atom is now filled with eight electrons, a stable configuration.The outer shell of each of the four hydrogen atoms isalso filled. Four covalent bonds—four shared electron pairs—hold methane together. Figure 2.7B shows several differentways to represent the molecular structure of methane. Table 2.2shows the covalent bonding capacities of some biologically significantelements.STRENGTH AND STABILITY Covalent bonds are very strong, meaningthat it takes a lot of energy to break them. At temperaturesin which life exists, the covalent bonds of biological moleculesare quite stable, as are their three-dimensional structures. However,this stability does not preclude change, as we will discover.ORIENTATION For a given pair of elements—for example, carbonbonded to hydrogen—the length of the covalent bond is alwaysthe same. And for a given atom within a molecule, the angleof each covalent bond, with respect to the other bonds, isgenerally the same. This is true regardless of the type of largermolecule that contains the atom. For example, the four filled orbitalsaround the carbon atom in methane are always distributedin space so that the bonded hydrogens point to the cornersof a regular tetrahedron, with carbon in the center (see Figure2.7B). Even when carbon is bonded to four atoms other than hydrogen,this three-dimensional orientation is more or less maintained.The orientation of covalent bonds in space gives the moleculestheir three-dimensional geometry, and the shapes ofmolecules contribute to their biological functions, as we will seein Section 3.1.MULTIPLE COVALENT BONDS Acovalent bond can be representedby a line between the chemical symbols for the linked atoms:• Asingle bond involves the sharing of a single pair of electrons(for example, H—H or C—H).26 CHAPTER 2 | SMALL MOLECULES AND THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFETABLE 2.1Chemical Bonds and InteractionsNAME BASIS OF INTERACTION STRUCTURE BOND ENERGYa (KCAL/MOL)Covalent bond Sharing of electron pairs 50–110Ionic bond Attraction of opposite charges 3–7Hydrogen bond Sharing of H atom 3–7Hydrophobic interaction Interaction of nonpolar substances 1–2in the presence of polar substances(especially water)van der Waals interaction Interaction of electrons of nonpolarsubstances 1aBond energy is the amount of energy needed to separate two bonded or interacting atoms under physiological conditions.N CH OHH O Cδ+ δ–NH HH HC CHH HC C HHHHHNOC H O+ –CHHHHH HTABLE 2.2Covalent Bonding Capabilities of SomeBiologically Important ElementsELEMENT USUAL NUMBER OF COVALENT BONDSHydrogen (H) 1Oxygen (O) 2Sulfur (S) 2Nitrogen (N) 3Carbon (C) 4Phosphorus (P) 5• Adouble bond involves the sharing of four electrons (twopairs) (C——C).• Triple bonds—six shared electrons—are rare, but there is onein nitrogen gas (N———N), which is the major component ofthe air we breathe.UNEQUAL SHARING OF ELECTRONS If two atoms of the same elementare covalently bonded, there is an equal sharing of thepair(s) of electrons in their outermost shells. However, whenthe two atoms are of different elements, the sharing is not necessarilyequal. One nucleus may exert a greater attractive forceon the electron pair than the other nucleus, so that the pair tendsto be closer to that atom.The attractive force that an atomic nucleus exerts on electronsin a covalent bond is called its electronegativity. The electronegativityof a nucleus depends on how many positive charges ithas (nuclei with more protons are more positive and thus moreattractive to electrons) and on the distances between the electronsin the bond and the nucleus (the closer the electrons, thegreater the electronegative pull). Table 2.3 shows the electronegativities(which are calculated to produce dimensionless quantities)of some elements important in biological systems.If two atoms are close to each other in electronegativity, theywill share electrons equally in what is called a nonpolar covalentbond. Two oxygen atoms, for example, each with an electronegativityof 3.5, will share electrons equally. So will two hydrogenatoms (each with an electronegativity of 2.1). But whenhydrogen bonds with oxygen to form water, the electrons involvedare unequally shared: they tend to be nearer to the oxygennucleus because it is the more electronegative of the two.When electrons are drawn to one nucleus more than to the other,the result is a polar covalent bond (Figure 2.8).2.2 | HOW DO ATOMS BOND TO FORM MOLECULES? 27Carbon can complete its outer shellby sharing the electrons of fourhydrogen atoms, forming methane.This model shows theshape methane presentsto its environment.The hydrogen atoms formcorners of a regular tetrahedron.Each line or pair of dots representsa shared pair of electrons.1 C and 4 H Methane (CH4)H(A)(B)CHHH or H CHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHStructural formulas Ball-and-stick modelCovalent bondSpace-filling modelBohr modelsCCC C2.7 Covalent Bonding Can Form Compounds (A) Bohr modelsshowing the formation of covalent bonds in methane, whosemolecular formula is CH4.

Bear in mind that these are models to illustrate certainproperties, and not the most accurate portrayal of reality.The electrons shared in bonds of waterare shared unequally because they aremore attracted to the nucleus of the oxygenatom than to those of the hydrogen atoms.HOHδ+δ−δ−δ+Bohr modelBall-and-stick modelSpace-filling modelHUnshared pairsof electronsO HHH δ+δ−δ+PolarcovalentbondsO2.8 Water’s Covalent Bonds Are Polar These three representationsall illustrate polar covalent bonding in water (H2O). When atoms with differentelectronegativities, such as oxygen and hydrogen, form a covalentbond, the electrons are drawn to one nucleus more than to the other. Amolecule held together by such a polar covalent bond has partial (δ+ andδ–) charges at different surfaces. In water, the shared electrons are displacedtoward the oxygen atom’s nucleus.Because of this unequal sharing of electrons, the oxygen endof the hydrogen–oxygen bond has a slightly negative charge(symbolized by δ– and spoken of as “delta negative,” meaninga partial unit of charge), and the hydrogen end has a slightly positivecharge (δ+). The bond is polar because these oppositecharges are separated at the two ends, or poles, of the bond. Thepartial charges that result from polar covalent bonds producepolar molecules or polar regions of large molecules. Polar bondswithin molecules greatly influence the interactions that they havewith other polar molecules. Water (H2O) is a polar compound,and this polarity has significant effects on its physical propertiesand chemical reactivity, as we will see in later chapters.Ionic bonds form by electrical attractionWhen one interacting atom is much more electronegative thanthe other, a complete transfer of one or more electrons may takeplace. Consider sodium (electronegativity 0.9) and chlorine (3.1).Asodium atom has only one electron in its outermost shell; thiscondition is unstable. Achlorine atom has seven electrons in itsoutermost shell—another unstable condition. Since the electronegativityof chlorine is so much greater than that of sodium,any electrons involved in bonding will tend to transfer completelyfrom sodium’s outermost shell to that of chlorine (Figure2.9). This reaction between sodium and chlorine makesthe resulting atoms more stable because they both have eightfully paired electrons in their outer shells. The result is two ions.Ions are electrically charged particles that form when atomsgain or lose one or more electrons:• The sodium ion (Na+) in our example has a +1 unit ofcharge because it has one less electron than it has protons.The outermost electron shell of the sodium ion is full, witheight electrons, so the ion is stable. Positively charged ionsare called cations.• The chloride ion (Cl–) has a –1 unit of charge because it hasone more electron than it has protons. This additional electrongives Cl– a stable outermost shell with eight electrons.Negatively charged ions are called anions.Some elements can form ions with multiple charges by losingor gaining more than one electron. Examples are Ca2+ (the calciumion, a calcium atom that has lost two electrons) and Mg2+(the magnesium ion). Two biologically important elements caneach yield more than one stable ion. Iron yields Fe2+ (the ferrousion) and Fe3+ (the ferric ion), and copper yields Cu+ (the cuprousion) and Cu2+ (the cupric ion). Groups of covalently bondedatoms that carry an electric charge are called complex ions; examplesinclude NH4+ (the ammonium ion), SO42– (the sulfateion), and PO43– (the phosphate ion). Once formed, ions are usuallystable and no more electrons are lost or gained.Ionic bonds are bonds formed as a result of the electrical attractionbetween ions bearing opposite charges. Ions can formbonds that result in stable solid compounds, which are referredto by the general term salts. Examples are sodium chloride(NaCl) and potassium phosphate (K3PO4). In sodium chloride—familiar to us as table salt—cations and anions are held togetherby ionic bonds. In solids, the ionic bonds are strong because theions are close together. However, when ions are dispersed inwater, the distance between them can be large; the strength oftheir attraction is thus greatly reduced. Under the conditions inliving cells, an ionic attraction is less strong than a nonpolar covalentbond (see Table 2.1).Not surprisingly, ions can interact with polar molecules, sincethey both carry electric charges. Such an interaction resultswhen a solid salt such as NaCl dissolves in water. Water moleculessurround the individual ions, separating them (Figure28 CHAPTER 2 | SMALL MOLECULES AND THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFEThe atoms are now electricallycharged ions.

In so doing,the chlorine atom becomes a negatively charged chloride ion (Cl–). Withone less electron, the sodium atom becomes a positively charged sodiumion (Na+).TABLE 2.3Some ElectronegativitiesELEMENT ELECTRONEGATIVITYOxygen (O) 3.5Chlorine (Cl) 3.1Nitrogen (N) 3.0Carbon (C) 2.5Phosphorus (P) 2.1Hydrogen (H) 2.1Sodium (Na) 0.9Potassium (K) 0.82.10). The negatively charged chloride ions attract the positivepoles of the water molecules, while the positively chargedsodium ions attract the negative poles of the water molecules.This is one of the special properties of water molecules, due totheir polarity.Hydrogen bonds may form within or betweenmolecules with polar covalent bondsIn liquid water, the negatively charged oxygen (δ–) atom of onewater molecule is attracted to the positively charged hydrogen(δ+) atoms of another water molecule (Figure 2.11A). Thebond resulting from this attraction is called a hydrogen bond.Hydrogen bonds are not restricted to water molecules; they mayalso form between a strongly electronegative atom and a hydrogenatom that is covalently bonded to a different electronegativeatom, as shown in Figure 2.11B.A hydrogen bond is weaker than most ionic bonds becauseits formation is due to partial charges (δ+ and δ–). It is muchweaker than a covalent bond between a hydrogen atom and anoxygen atom (see Table 2.1). Although individual hydrogenbonds are weak, many of them can form within one molecule orbetween two molecules. In these cases, the hydrogen bonds togetherhave considerable strength, and greatly influence thestructure and properties of substances. Later in this chapter we’llsee how hydrogen bonding between water molecules contributesto many of the properties that make water so significantfor living systems. Hydrogen bonds also play important roles indetermining and maintaining the three-dimensional shapes ofgiant molecules such as DNA and proteins (see Section 3.2).Polar and nonpolar substances:Each interacts best with its own kindJust as water molecules can interact with one another throughhydrogen bonds, any molecule that is polar can interact withother polar molecules through the weak (δ+ to δ–) attractionsof hydrogen bonds. If a polar molecule interacts with water inthis way, it is called hydrophilic (“water-loving”) (Figure 2.12A).2.2 | HOW DO ATOMS BOND TO FORM MOLECULES? 29–+ +– + +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +– + +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +– –––––––––––– –––– –––––– – – –– –– ––++ + ++ ++ ++ +++++++ +++ ++ +++ ++++––––––––––––––––––––––– – –––– –––++ + +++ + ++ +++++++ +++ ++ +++++++–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +––+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ +–+ ++Ionic bonds betweenNa+ and Cl– hold ionstogether in a solid crystal.When NaCl is dissolvedin water, the chlorideanion (–) attracts theδ+ pole of water…… and the sodiumcation (+) attracts theδ– pole of water.UndissolvedsodiumchlorideWatermoleculesChloride ion(Cl–)Sodium ion(Na+)2.10 Water Molecules Surround Ions When an ionic solid dissolvesin water, polar water molecules cluster around the cations and anions,preventing them from re-associating.HNOCHydrogenbondsTwo water molecules Two parts of one large molecule(or two large molecules)OOH HHHδ+ δ+δ+δ+δ− δ−δ−δ+δ+ δ−(A) (B)2.11 Hydrogen Bonds Can Form Between or Within Molecules(A) A hydrogen bond between two molecules is an attraction between anegative charge on one molecule and the positive charge on a hydrogenatom of the second molecule.

For example, carbon (electronegativity 2.5) formsnonpolar bonds with hydrogen (electronegativity 2.1), and moleculescontaining only hydrogen and carbon atoms—called hydrocarbonmolecules—are nonpolar. In water these molecules tendto aggregate with one another rather than with the polar watermolecules. Therefore, nonpolar molecules are known ashydrophobic (“water-hating”), and the interactions betweenthem are called hydrophobic interactions (Figure 2.12B). Of course,hydrophobic substances do not really “hate” water; they canform weak interactions with it, since the electronegativities ofcarbon and hydrogen are not exactly the same. But these interactionsare far weaker than the hydrogen bonds between thewater molecules, so the nonpolar substances tend to aggregate.The interactions between nonpolar substances are enhancedby van der Waals forces, which occur when the atoms of two nonpolarmolecules are in close proximity. These brief interactionsresult from random variations in the electron distribution in onemolecule, which create opposite charge distributions in the adjacentmolecule. Although a single van der Waals interaction is briefand weak, the sum of many such interactions over the entire spanof a large nonpolar molecule can result in substantial attraction.This makes nonpolar molecules stick together in the polar (aqueous)environment inside organisms. We will see this many times,for example in the structure of biological membranes.2.2 RECAPSome atoms form strong covalent bonds with otheratoms by sharing one or more pairs of electrons. Unequalsharing of electrons produces polarity. Otheratoms become ions by losing or gaining electrons,and they interact with other ions or polar molecules.• Why is a covalent bond stronger than an ionic bond?See pp. 26–28 and Table 2.1• How do variations in electronegativity result in theunequal sharing of electrons in polar molecules? Seepp. 27–28 and Figure 2.8• What is a hydrogen bond and how is it important inbiological systems? See p. 29 and Figure 2.11The bonding of atoms into molecules is not necessarily a permanentaffair. The dynamic of life involves constant change,even at the molecular level. Let’s look at how molecules interactwith one another—how they break up, how they find newpartners, and what the consequences of those changes can be.How Do Atoms Change Partners in 2.3 Chemical Reactions?Achemical reaction occurs when moving atoms collide with sufficientenergy to combine or change their bonding partners. Considerthe combustion reaction that takes place in the flame of apropane stove. When propane (C3H8) reacts with oxygen gas(O2), the carbon atoms become bonded to oxygen atoms insteadof hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen atoms become bonded tooxygen instead of carbon (Figure 2.13). As the covalently bondedatoms change partners, the composition of the matter changes;propane and oxygen gas become carbon dioxide and water. Thischemical reaction can be represented by the equationC3H8 + 5 O2 → 3 CO2 + 4 H2O + EnergyReactants → ProductsIn this equation, the propane and oxygen are the reactants, andthe carbon dioxide and water are the products. In fact, this is aspecial type of reaction called an oxidation–reduction reaction.Electrons and protons are transferred from propane (thereducing agent) to oxygen (the oxidizing agent) to form water.You will see this kind of reaction involving electron/protontransfer many times in later chapters.The products of a chemical reaction have very different propertiesfrom the reactants. In the case shown in Figure 2.13, thereaction is complete: all the propane and oxygen are used up informing the two products. The arrow symbolizes the directionof the chemical reaction. The numbers preceding the molecularformulas indicate how many molecules are used or produced.Note that in this and all other chemical reactions, matter isneither created nor destroyed. The total number of carbon atomson the left (3) equals the total number of carbon atoms on theright (3). In other words, the equation is balanced. However, thereis another aspect of this reaction: the heat and light of the stove’sflame reveal that the reaction between propane and oxygen releasesa great deal of energy.Energy is defined as the capacity to do work, but in the contextof chemical reactions, it can be thought of as the capacity forchange. Chemical reactions do not create or destroy energy, butchanges in the form of energy usually accompany chemical reactions.In the reaction between propane and oxygen, a large amountof heat energy is released. This energy was present in anotherform, called potential chemical energy, in the covalent bonds withinPropaneReactants ProductsOxygengasCarbondioxideWater++++++++ Heatand light+ EnergyC3H8 5 O2 3 CO2 4 H2O2.13 Bonding Partners and Energy May Change in a ChemicalReaction One molecule of propane from this burner reacts with fivemolecules of oxygen gas to give three molecules of carbon dioxide andfour molecules of water. This reaction releases energy in the form of heatand light.30 CHAPTER 2 | SMALL MOLECULES AND THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFEthe propane and oxygen gas molecules. Not all reactions releaseenergy; indeed, many chemical reactions require that energy besupplied from the environment. Some of this energy is then storedas potential chemical energy in the bonds formed in the products.We will see in future chapters how reactions that release energyand reactions that require energy can be linked together.Many chemical reactions take place in living cells, and someof these have a lot in common with the oxidation–reduction reactionthat happens in the combustion of propane. In cells, thereactants are different (they may be sugars or fats), and the reactionsproceed by many intermediate steps that permit thereleased energy to be harvested and put to use by the cells.But the products are the same: carbon dioxide and water. Wewill discuss energy changes, oxidation–reduction reactions, andseveral other types of chemical reactions that are prevalent inliving systems in Part Three of this book.2.3 RECAPIn a chemical reaction, a set of reactants is convertedto a set of products with different chemicalcompositions. This is accomplished by breaking andmaking bonds. Reactions may release energy orrequire its input.• Explain how a chemical equation is balanced. Seep. 30 and Figure 2.13• How can the form of energy change during a chemicalreaction? See p. 30We will present and discuss energy changes, oxidation–reduction reactions, and several other types ofchemical reactions that are prevalent in living systemsin Part Two of this book. First, however, we must understandthe unique properties of the substance inwhich most biochemical reactions take place: water.What Makes Water So 2.4 Important for Life?Water is an unusual substance with unusual properties.Under conditions on Earth, water exists in solid,liquid, and gas forms, all of which have relevance toliving systems. Water allows chemical reactions to occurinside living organisms, and it is necessary for theformation of certain biological structures. In this sectionwe will explore how the structure and interactionsof water molecules make water essential to life.Water has a unique structure and special propertiesThe molecule H2O has unique chemical features. As we havealready learned, water is a polar molecule that can form hydrogenbonds. The four pairs of electrons in the outer shell of theoxygen atom repel one another, giving the water molecule atetrahedral shape:These chemical features explain some of the interestingproperties of water, such as the ability of ice to float, the meltingand freezing temperatures of water, the ability of water tostore heat, the formation of water droplets, and water’s abilityto dissolve—and not dissolve—many substances.ICE FLOATS In water’s solid state (ice), individual water moleculesare held in place by hydrogen bonds. Each molecule isbonded to four other molecules in a rigid, crystalline structure(Figure 2.14). Although the molecules are held firmly in place,they are not as tightly packed as they are in liquid water. Inother words, solid water is less dense than liquid water, which iswhy ice floats.δ+δ−δ+OHHNon-bondingelectron pairsSharedelectron pairs2.4 | WHAT MAKES WATER SO IMPORTANT FOR LIFE? 31In ice, water moleculesare held in a rigid stateby hydrogen bonds.In its gaseous state,water does not formhydrogen bonds.Hydrogen bonds continuallybreak and form as watermolecules move.Solid water (ice)Liquid waterGaseous water (vapor)2.14 Hydrogen Bonding and the Properties of WaterHydrogen bonding exists between the molecules of water inboth its liquid and solid states. Ice is more structured but lessdense than liquid water, which is why ice floats. Water forms agas when its hydrogen bonds are broken and the moleculesmove farther apart.Think of the biological consequences if ice were to sink in water.Apond would freeze from the bottom up, becoming a solidblock of ice in winter and killing most of the organisms livingthere. Once the whole pond is frozen, its temperature could dropwell below the freezing point of water. But in fact ice floats, formingan insulating layer on the top of the pond, and reducing heatflow to the cold air above. Thus fish, plants, and other organismsin the pond are not subjected to temperatures lower than 0°C,which is the freezing point of pure water.MELTING, FREEZING, AND HEAT CAPACITY Compared with manyother substances that have molecules of similar size, ice requiresa great deal of heat energy to melt. This is because so manyhydrogen bonds must be broken in order for water to changefrom solid to liquid. In the opposite process—freezing—a greatdeal of energy is released to the environment.This property of water contributes to the surprising constancyof the temperatures found in oceans and other large bodiesof water throughout the year. The temperature changes ofcoastal land masses are also moderated by large bodies of water.Indeed, water helps minimize variations in atmospherictemperature across the planet. This moderating ability is a resultof the high heat capacity of liquid water, which is in turn aresult of its high specific heat.The specific heat of a substance is the amount of heat energyrequired to raise the temperature of 1 gram of that substance by1°C. Raising the temperature of liquid water takes a relativelylarge amount of heat because much of the heat energy is usedto break the hydrogen bonds that hold the liquid together. Comparedwith other small molecules that are liquids, water has ahigh specific heat.Water also has a high heat of vaporization, which means thata lot of heat is required to change water from its liquid to itsgaseous state (the process of evaporation). Once again, much ofthe heat energy is used to break the many hydrogen bonds betweenthe water molecules. This heat must be absorbed fromthe environment in contact with the water. Evaporation thushas a cooling effect on the environment—whether a leaf, a forest,or an entire land mass. This effect explains why sweatingcools the human body: as sweat evaporates from the skin, it usesup some of the adjacent body heat.COHESION AND SURFACE TENSION In liquid water, individualmolecules are able to move about. The hydrogen bonds betweenthe molecules continually form and break (see Figure 2.14).Chemists estimate that this occurs about a trillion times a minutefor a single water molecule, making it a truly dynamic structure.At any given time, a water molecule will form an average of3.4 hydrogen bonds with other water molecules. These hydrogenbonds explain the cohesive strength of liquid water. This cohesivestrength, or cohesion, is defined as the capacity of watermolecules to resist coming apart from one another when placedunder tension. Water’s cohesive strength permits narrowcolumns of liquid water to move from the roots to the leavesof tall trees. When water evaporates from the leaves, the entirecolumn moves upward in response to the pull of the moleculesat the top.The surface of liquid water exposed to the air is difficult topuncture because the water molecules at the surface are hydrogen-bonded to other water molecules below them (Figure 2.15).This surface tension of water permits a container to be filledslightly above its rim without overflowing, and it permits insectsto walk on the surface of a pond.Water is an excellent solvent—the medium of lifeA human body is over 70 percent water by weight, excludingthe minerals contained in bones. Water is the dominant componentof virtually all living organisms, and most biochemical reactionstake place in this watery, or aqueous, environment.A solution is produced when a substance (the solute) is dissolvedin a liquid (the solvent). If the solvent is water, then the solutionis an aqueous solution. Many of the important moleculesin biological systems are polar, and therefore soluble in water.Many important biochemical reactions occur in aqueous solutionswithin cells. Biologists study these reactions in order to identifythe reactants and products and to determine their amounts:• Qualitative analyses deal with the identification of substancesinvolved in chemical reactions. For example, a qualitativeanalysis would be used to investigate the steps involved,and the products formed, during the combustion ofglucose in living tissues.• Quantitative analyses measure concentrations or amounts ofsubstances. For example, a biochemist would seek to describehow much of a certain product is formed during thecombustion of a given amount of glucose using a quantitativeanalysis. What follows is a brief introduction to someof the quantitative chemical terms you will see in this book.Fundamental to quantitative thinking in chemistry and biologyis the concept of the mole. Amole is the amount of a substance(in grams) that is numerically equal to its molecular weight.32 CHAPTER 2 | SMALL MOLECULES AND THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE2.15 Surface Tension Water droplets form “beads” on the surfaceof a leaf because hydrogen bonds keep the water molecules together.The leaf is coated in a nonpolar wax that does not interact with the watermolecules.So a mole of table sugar (C12H22O11) weighs about 342 grams;a mole of sodium ion (Na+) weighs 23 grams; and a mole of hydrogengas (H2) weighs 2 grams.Quantitative analyses do not yield direct counts of molecules.Because the amount of a substance in 1 mole is directly relatedto its molecular weight, it follows that the number of moleculesin 1 mole is constant for all substances. So 1 mole of salt containsthe same number of molecules as 1 mole of table sugar.This constant number of molecules in a mole is called Avogadro’snumber, and it is 6.02 × 1023 molecules per mole.Chemists work with moles of substances (which can be weighedout in the laboratory) instead of actual molecules (which are toonumerous to be counted). Consider 34.2 grams (just over 1ounce) of table sugar, C12H22O11. This is one-tenth of a mole, oras Avogadro puts it, 6.02 × 1022 molecules.If you have trouble grasping the concept of a mole, compareit with the concept of a dozen. We buy a dozen eggs or a dozendoughnuts, knowing that we will get 12 of whichever we buy,even though they don’t weigh the same or take up the sameamount of space.A chemist can dissolve a mole of sugar (342 g) in water tomake 1 liter of solution, knowing that the mole contains 6.02 ×1023 individual sugar molecules. This solution—1 mole of a substancedissolved in water to make 1 liter—is called a 1 molar(1 M) solution. When a physician injects a certain molar concentrationof a drug into the bloodstream of a patient, a rough calculationcan be made of the actual number of drug moleculesthat will interact with the patient’s cells.The many molecules dissolved in the water of living tissuesare not present at concentrations anywhere near 1 molar. Mostare in the micromolar (millionths of a mole per liter of solution;μM) to millimolar (thousandths of a mole per liter; mM) range.Some, such as hormone molecules, are even less concentratedthan that. While these molarities seem to indicate very low concentrations,remember that even a 1 μMsolution has 6.02 × 1017molecules of the solute per liter.Aqueous solutions may be acidic or basicWhen some substances dissolve in water, they release hydrogenions (H+), which are actually single, positively charged protons.Hydrogen ions can attach to other molecules and changetheir properties. For example, the protons in “acid rain” candamage plants, and you probably have experienced the excessof hydrogen ions that we call “acid indigestion.”Here we will examine the properties of acids (defined as substancesthat release H+) and bases (defined as substances whichaccept H+). We will distinguish between strong and weak acidsand bases and provide a quantitative means for stating the concentrationof H+ in solutions: the pH scale.ACIDS RELEASE H+ When hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added towater, it dissolves, releasing the ions H+ and Cl–:HCl →H+ + Cl–Because its H+ concentration has increased, such a solutionis acidic.Acids are substances that release H+ ions in solution. HCl isan acid, as is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid). One molecule of sulfuric acidwill ionize to yield two H+ and one SO42–. Biological compoundsthat contain —COOH (the carboxyl group) are also acids because—COOH →—COO– + H+Acids that fully ionize in solution, such as HCl and H2SO4 arecalled strong acids. However, not all acids ionize fully in water.For example, if acetic acid (CH3COOH) is added to water, somewill dissociate into two ions (CH3COO– and H+), but some ofthe original acetic acid remains as well. Because the reaction isnot complete, acetic acid is a weak acid.BASES ACCEPT H+ Bases are substances that accept H+ in solution.Just as with acids, there are strong and weak bases. IfNaOH (sodium hydroxide) is added to water, it dissolves andionizes, releasing OH– and Na+ ions:NaOH → Na+ + OH–Because the concentration of OH– increases and OH– absorbsH+ to form water (OH– + H+ → H2O), such a solution is basic.Because this reaction is complete, NaOH is a strong base.Weak bases include the bicarbonate ion (HCO3–), which canaccept a H+ ion and become carbonic acid (H2CO3), and ammonia(NH3), which can accept a H+ and become an ammoniumion (NH4+). Biological compounds that contain —NH2 (theamino group) are also bases because—NH2 + H+ → —NH3+ACID–BASE REACTIONS MAY BE REVERSIBLE When acetic acid isdissolved in water, two reactions happen. First, the acetic acidforms its ions:CH3COOH → CH3COO– + H+Then, once the ions are formed, some of them re-form aceticacid:CH3COO– + H+ → CH3COOHThis pair of reactions is reversible. Areversible reaction can proceedin either direction—left to right or right to left—dependingon the relative starting concentrations of the reactants andproducts. The formula for a reversible reaction can be writtenusing a double arrow:CH3COOH ~CH3COO– + H+In terms of acids and bases, there are two types of reactions, dependingon the extent of the reversibility:• The ionization of strong acids and bases in water is virtuallyirreversible.• The ionization of weak acids and bases in water is somewhatreversible.WATER IS A WEAK ACID AND A WEAK BASE The water molecule hasa slight but significant tendency to ionize into a hydroxide ion(OH–) and a hydrogen ion (H+). Actually, two water molecules2.4 | WHAT MAKES WATER SO IMPORTANT FOR LIFE? 33participate in this reaction. One of the two molecules “captures”a hydrogen ion from the other, forming a hydroxide ion and ahydronium ion:The hydronium ion is, in effect, a hydrogen ion bound to awater molecule. For simplicity, biochemists tend to use a modifiedrepresentation of the ionization of water:H2O → H+ + OH–The ionization of water is important to all living creatures. Thisfact may seem surprising, since only about one water moleculein 500 million is ionized at any given time. But this is less surprisingif we focus on the abundance of water in living systems,and the reactive nature of the H+ ions produced by ionization.pH: HYDROGEN ION CONCENTRATION Compounds or ions can beacids or bases, and thus, solutions can be acidic or basic. We canmeasure how acidic or basic a solution is by measuring its concentrationof H+ in moles per liter (its molarity; see page 33). Hereare some examples:• Pure water has a H+ concentration of 10–7 M.• A1 M HCl solution has a H+ concentration of 1 M (recallthat all the HCl dissociates into its ions).• A1 M NaOH solution has a H+ concentration of 10–14 M.This is a very wide range of numbers to work with—think aboutthe decimals! It is easier to work with the logarithm of the H+concentration, because logarithms compress this range: the log10of 100, for example is 2, and the log10 of 0.01 is –2. Because mostH+ concentrations in living systems are less than 1M, their log10values are negative. For convenience, we convert these negativenumbers into positive ones, by using the negative of the logarithmof the H+ molar concentration (the molar concentrationis designated by square brackets: [H+]). This number is calledthe pH of the solution.Since the H+ concentration of pure water is 10–7 M, its pH is–log(10–7) = –(–7), or 7. A smaller negative logarithm means alarger number. In practical terms, a lower pH means a higher H+concentration, or greater acidity. In 1 M HCl, the H+ concentrationis 1 M, so the pH is the negative logarithm of 1 (–log 100), or0. The pH of 1 MNaOH is the negative logarithm of 10–14, or 14.A solution with a pH of less than 7 is acidic—it containsmore H+ ions than OH– ions. A solution with a pH of 7 is neutral(without net charge), and a solution with a pH value greaterthan 7 is basic. Figure 2.16 shows the pH values of some commonsubstances.Why is this discussion of pH so important in biology? Manybiologically important molecules contain charged groups(e.g., —COO–) that can interact with the polar regions of waterto form their structures. But these groups can combine withH+ or other ions in their environment to form uncharged groups(e.g., —COOH, see above). These uncharged groups have muchless tendency to interact with water. If such a group is part of alarger molecule, it might now induce the molecule to fold insuch a way that it stays away from water because it is hydrophobic.In a more acidic environment, a negatively chargedgroup such as —COO– is more likely to combine with H+. Sothe pH of a biological tissue is a key to the three-dimensionalstructures of many of its constituent molecules. Organisms doall they can to minimize changes in the pH of their waterymedium. An important way to do this is with buffers.BUFFERS The maintenance of internal constancy—homeostasis—is a hallmark of all living things and extends to pH. As we mentionedearlier, if biological molecules lose or gain H+ ions theirproperties can change, thus upsetting homeostasis. Internal constancyis achieved with buffers: solutions that maintain a relativelyconstant pH even when substantial amounts of acid orbase are added. How does this work?A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and its correspondingbase—for example, carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate ions(HCO3–). If an acid is added to a solution containing this buffer,HWater molecule(H2O)+ ++Water molecule(H2O)2 H2O OH– H3O+Hydroxide ionOH–, a baseHydronium ionH3O+, an acidOHHHOOHH HHO– +A low pH indicatesa strong acid.A high pH indicatesa strong base.A change of 1 pHunit means atenfold change inH+ concentration.Stomach acidBattery acidLemon juiceVinegar, colaBeerDistilled waterSalivaHuman urineHuman bloodSeawaterBaking sodaMilk ofmagnesiaHouseholdammoniaOven cleanerBasicpH valueH+ concentration(moles per liter)TomatoesGrapesBlack coffeeRain01234567891011121314110–110–210–310–410–510–610–710–810–910–1010–1110–1210–1310–14Neutral pHAcidic2.16 pH Values of Some Familiar Substances34 CHAPTER 2 | SMALL MOLECULES AND THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFEnot all the H+ ions from the acid stay in solution. Instead, manyof them combine with the bicarbonate ions to produce more carbonicacid:HCO3– + H+ → H2CO3This reaction uses up some of the H+ ions in the solution anddecreases the acidifying effect of the added acid. If a base isadded, the reaction essentially reverses. Some of the carbonicacid ionizes to produce bicarbonate ions and more H+, whichcounteracts some of the added base. In this way, the buffer minimizesthe effect that an added acid or base has on pH. Thisbuffering system is present in the blood, where it is importantfor preventing significant changes in pH that could disruptthe ability of the blood to carry vital oxygen to tissues. Agivenamount of acid or base causes a smaller pH change in a bufferedsolution than in a non-buffered one (Figure 2.17).Buffers illustrate an important chemical principle of reversiblereactions, called the law of mass action. Addition of a reactanton one side of a reversible system drives the reaction inthe direction that uses up that compound. In the case of buffers,addition of an acid drives the reaction in one direction; additionof a base drives the reaction in the other direction.We use a buffer to relieve the common problem of indigestion.The lining of the stomach constantly secretes hydrochloricacid, making the stomach contents acidic. Excessive stomachacid inhibits digestion and causes discomfort. We can relievethis discomfort by ingesting a salt such as NaHCO3 (“bicarbonateof soda”), which acts as a buffer.2.4 RECAPMost of the chemistry of life occurs in water, whichhas molecular properties that make it suitable for itsimportant biochemical roles. A special property ofwater is its ability to ionize (release hydrogen ions).The presence of hydrogen ions in solution canchange the properties of biological molecules.• Describe some of the biologically important propertiesof water arising from its molecular structure. See pp.31–32 and Figure 2.14• What is a solution, and why do we call water “themedium of life”? See pp. 32–33• What is the relationship between hydrogen ions, acids,and bases? Explain what the pH scale measures. Seepp. 33–34 and Figure 2.16• How does a buffer work, and why is buffering importantto living systems? See pp. 34–35 and Figure 2.17An Overview and a PreviewNow that we have covered the major properties of atoms andmolecules, let’s review them and see how these properties relateto the major molecules of biological systems.• Molecules vary in size. Some are small, such as those of hydrogengas (H2) and methane (CH4). Others are larger, suchas a molecule of table sugar (C12H22O11), which has 45atoms. Still others, especially proteins and nucleic acids, aregigantic, containing tens of thousands or even millions ofatoms.• All molecules have a specific three-dimensional shape. For example,the orientations of the bonding orbitals around the carbonatom give the methane molecule (CH4) the shape of aregular tetrahedron (see Figure 2.7B). Larger moleculeshave complex shapes that result from the numbers andkinds of atoms present, and the ways in which they arelinked together. Some large molecules, such as the proteinhemoglobin (the oxygen carrier in red blood cells), havecompact, ball-like shapes. Others, such as the protein calledkeratin that makes up your hair, have long, thin, ropelikestructures. Their shapes relate to the roles these moleculesplay in living cells.• Molecules are characterized by certain chemical properties thatdetermine their biological roles. Chemists use the characteristicsof composition, structure (three-dimensional shape),reactivity, and solubility to distinguish a pure sample ofone molecule from a sample of a different molecule. Thepresence of certain groups of atoms can impart distinctivechemical properties to a molecule.Between the small molecules discussed in this chapter and theworld of the living cell are the macromolecules. These largermolecules—proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids—will be discussed in the next two chapters.2.4 | WHAT MAKES WATER SO IMPORTANT FOR LIFE? 35In the presence of buffer, additionsof even large quantities of base resultin relatively small changes in pH.When buffering capacityis exceeded, added basegreatly increases pH.In the absence of buffer, there is arapid increase in pH as base is added.0 1 2 3 4 5Acidic(H+ high)87654pH321Basic(H+ low)Buffering rangeAmount of base added (arbitrary units)2.17 Buffers Minimize Changes in pH With increasing amounts ofadded base, the overall slope of a graph of pH is downward. Without abuffer, the slope is steep. Inside the buffering range of an added buffer,however, the slope is shallow. At very high and very low values of pH,where the buffer is ineffective, the slopes are much steeper.1.

Each atom consists of a positivelycharged nucleus made up of protons and neutrons, surroundedby electrons bearing negative charges. Review Figure 2.1• The number of protons in the nucleus defines an element.There are many elements in the universe, but only a few ofthem make up the bulk of living organisms: C, H, O, P, N, and S.Review Figure 2.2• Isotopes of an element differ in their numbers of neutrons.Radioisotopes are radioactive, emitting radiation as they breakdown.• Electrons are distributed in shells, which are volumes of spacedefined by specific numbers of orbitals. Each orbital contains amaximum of two electrons. Review Figures 2.4 and 2.5, WEBACTIVITY 2.1• In losing, gaining, or sharing electrons to become more stable,an atom can combine with other atoms to form a molecule.2.2 How Do Atoms Bond to Form Molecules?SEE ANIMATED TUTORIAL 2.1• A chemical bond is an attractive force that links two atomstogether in a molecule. Review Table 2.1• A compound is a substance made up of molecules with two ormore elements bonded together in a fixed ratio, such as water(H2O) or table sugar (C6H12O6).• Covalent bonds are strong bonds formed when two atomsshare one or more pairs of electrons. Review Figure 2.6• When two atoms of unequal electronegativity bond with eachother, a polar covalent bond is formed. The two ends, or poles,of the bond have partial charges (δ+ or δ–). Review Figure 2.8• Ions are electrically charged bodies that form when an atomgains or loses one or more electrons in order to form more stableelectron configurations. Anions and cations are negativelyand positively charged ions, respectively. Different chargesattract, and like charges repel each other.• Ionic bonds are electrical attractions between oppositelycharged ions. Ionic bonds are strong in solids (salts), but weakenwhen the ions are separated from one another in solution.Review Figure 2.9• A hydrogen bond is a weak electrical attraction that formsbetween a δ+ hydrogen atom in one molecule and a δ– atom inanother molecule (or in another part of a large molecule).Hydrogen bonds are abundant in water.• Nonpolar molecules interact very little with polar molecules,including water. Nonpolar molecules are attracted to oneanother by very weak bonds called van der Waals forces.2.3 How Do Atoms Change Partners in ChemicalReactions?• In chemical reactions, atoms combine or change their bondingpartners. Reactants are converted into products.• Some chemical reactions release energy as one of their products;other reactions can occur only if energy is provided to thereactants.• Neither matter nor energy is created or destroyed in a chemicalreaction, but both change form. Review Figure 2.13• Some chemical reactions, especially in biology, are reversible.That is, the products formed may be converted back to thereactants.• In living cells, chemical reactions take place in multiple steps sothat the released energy can be harvested for cellular activities.2.4 What Makes Water So Important for Life?• Water’s molecular structure and its capacity to form hydrogenbonds give it unique properties that are significant for life.Review Figure 2.14• The high specific heat of water means that water gains or losesa great deal of heat when it changes state. Water’s high heat ofvaporization ensures effective cooling when water evaporates.• The cohesion of water molecules refers to their capacity toresist coming apart from one another. Hydrogen bondsbetween water molecules play an essential role in theseproperties.• A solution is produced when a solid substance (the solute) dissolvesin a liquid (the solvent). Water is the critically importantsolvent for life.• Acids are solutes that release hydrogen ions in aqueous solutions.Bases accept hydrogen ions.• The pH of a solution is the negative logarithm of its hydrogenion concentration. Values lower than pH 7 indicate that a solutionis acidic; values above pH 7 indicate a basic solution.Review Figure 2.16• A buffer is a mixture of a weak acid and a base that limitschanges in the pH of a solution when acids or bases are added.
