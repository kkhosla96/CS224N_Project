24Some fishes, including the famous electric eel of Centraland South America, can produce high-voltagedischarges of electricity (up to 650 volts) that theyuse to stun their prey. A variety of other fish species areknown to produce somewhat weaker electric discharges.Most of these latter species live in murky water where visualcues are limited; they use electric signals to locate (butnot to stun) their prey. Electric signals also allow them tocommunicate with other individuals of their own species.Electric organs have evolved independently in severalfish lineages. How did these organs evolve? Let’s considerfirst the physical basis of the electrical signal. Voltagegatedsodium channels are large proteins that underlie thegeneration and propagation of rapid electrical signals innerve, muscle, and heart tissues (see Chapter 45). Electricsignals are transmitted along nerves to muscles as thesodium channels embedded in cell membranes are stimulatedto open. These channels control the concentrationof positively charged sodium ions (Na+) on the inside relativeto the outside of cells, resulting in an electric chargethat is transmitted across the surface of the muscle, leadingto muscular contraction.Most vertebrates have a number of different copies ofthe genes encoding the several proteins that make up thesodium channel. These copies arose through a series ofgene duplications in the distant past of vertebrate genomeevolution. Such duplications allowed for the specializationof protein function, making it possible for differentsodium channels to exist in different types of tissue. In thecase of electric fishes, one of the sodium channel genesordinarily expressed in muscle diverged and a new functionalprotein evolved. Changes in a relatively small numberof nucleotide positions in the gene resulted in modifiedsodium channels, allowing the development of a neworgan with a unique function—the generation of externallytransmitted electric energy.The “living battery” electric organ differs from skeletalmuscle in important ways. The organ is composed ofmany electrocytes, each of which is a derived muscle cellcapable of producing a small electric charge. Electrocytesare stacked in series, much like the plates in acar battery. Rather than producing musclecontraction and movement, however, theorgan generates an electric discharge. Thissignal is species-specific, which allowsintraspecific communication and also servesas an isolating mechanism between species(see Chapter 23).The repeated evolution of electricorgans from muscle tissue is facilitatedby relatively simple molecular changesShocking evolutionAn Electric Fish The elephant-nose fish(Gnathonemus petersi ), a river-dwelling speciesfrom West Africa, is one of many fishes in whichweakly discharging electric organs have evolvedvia modifications in sodium channel proteins.How Are Genomes Used 24.1 to Study Evolution?An organism’s genome is the full set of genes it contains, as wellas any noncoding regions of the DNA (or in the case of someviruses, RNA). Most of the genes of eukaryotic organisms arefound on chromosomes in the nucleus, but genes are also presentin chloroplasts and mitochondria. In organisms that reproducesexually, both males and females transmit nuclear genes,but mitochondrial and chloroplast genes usually are transmittedonly via the cytoplasm of one of the two gametes (usuallyfrom the female parent).Genomes must be replicated to be transmitted from parentsto offspring. DNA replication does not occur without error,however. Mistakes in DNA replication—mutations—providemuch of the raw material for evolutionary change. Mutationsare essential for the long-term survival of life, because they arethe initial source of the genetic variation that permits organismsto evolve in response to changes in their environment.A particular copy of a gene will not be passed on to successivegenerations unless an individual with that copy survivesand reproduces. Therefore, the capacity to cooperate with differentcombinations of other genes is likely to increase the probabilitythat a particular allele will become fixed in a population.Moreover, the degree and timing of a gene’s expression are affectedby its location in the genome. For these reasons, the genesof an individual organism can be viewed as interacting membersof a group, among which there are divisions of labor butalso strong interdependencies.Agenome, then, is not simply a random collection of genesin random order along chromosomes. Rather, it is a complexset of integrated genes, regulatory sequences, and structural elements,as well as vast stretches of noncoding DNA that mayhave little direct function. The positions of genes, as well astheir sequences, are subject to evolutionary change, as are theextent and location of noncoding DNA. All of these changescan affect the phenotype of an organism. Biologists have nowsequenced the complete genomes of a large number of organisms,including humans. This information is helping us to understandhow and why organisms differ, how they function,and how they have evolved.Evolution of genomes results in biological diversityThe field of molecular evolution investigates the mechanismsand consequences of the evolution of macromolecules. Molecularevolutionists study relationships between the structures ofgenes and proteins and the functions of organisms. They alsoIN THIS CHAPTER we will see how molecular biologistsinfer both the patterns and the causes of molecular evolutionfrom studies of nucleic acids and proteins. We will explorehow the functions of molecules change, how genomeschange in size, and where new genes come from. Finally, wewill explore some practical applications of molecular evolutionfor producing new molecules with novel functions.in certain genes, changes that result in major functionalchanges to sodium channels. Gene duplication facilitatesthe process, since “extra” genes allow for such specializationin protein function. Finally, interspecific differencesin sodium channel function result from additionalchanges in nucleotide sequences of the respectivegenes. These small differences allow different species offishes to use different communication signals, which improvesintraspecific communication while reducing interspecificinterference.The evolution of sodium channels is just one exampleof how an understanding of the evolution of genes andgenomes helps biologists understand the diversity of lifeon Earth. Molecular investigations also allow biologiststo observe the process of evolution directly in the laboratory,and to use evolutionary principles to produce newmolecules with useful functions.CHAPTER OUTLINE24.1 How Are Genomes Used to Study Evolution?24.2 What Do Genomes Reveal About EvolutionaryProcesses?24.3 How Do Genomes Gain and Maintain Functions?24.4 What Are Some Applications of MolecularEvolution?A High-Voltage Electric Fish This torpedo ray can put outas much as 220 volts of electricity.

The molecules of special interest to molecularevolutionists are nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) andproteins. Students of this field ask questions such as:What does molecular variation tell us about a gene’sfunction? Why do the genomes of different organismsvary in size? What evolutionary forces shape patterns ofvariation among genomes? And a crucial question froman evolutionary perspective, How do genomes acquirenew functions? Investigations into the evolution of particularnucleic acids and proteins are instrumental inreconstructing the evolutionary histories of genes and indetermining which organisms carry them. Ultimately,molecular evolutionists hope to explain the molecularbasis of biological diversity.The evolution of nucleic acids and proteins dependson genetic variation introduced by mutations. One ofseveral ways in which genes evolve is by means of nucleotidesubstitutions. In genes that encode proteins, nucleotidesubstitutions sometimes result in amino acidreplacements that can change the charge, the structure(secondary or tertiary), and other chemical and physicalproperties of the encoded protein. Phenotypicchanges in the protein often affect the way that proteinfunctions in the organism.Evolutionary changes in genes and proteins can beidentified by comparing the nucleotide or amino acid sequencesof different organisms. The longer two sequenceshave been evolving separately, the more differences theyaccumulate (bearing in mind that different genes in thesame species evolve at different rates). Determining whenchanges in nucleotide or amino acid sequences occurredis a first step toward inferring their causes. Knowledgeof the pattern and rate of evolutionary change in a givenmacromolecule is useful in reconstructing the evolutionaryhistory of groups of organisms.To compare genes or proteins across different organisms,biologists need a way to identify homologous partsof molecules. (Recall from Section 22.1 that homologousfeatures are shared by two or more species and havebeen inherited from a common ancestor.) Homologousparts of a protein can be traced to homologous aminoacid sequences. And, since nucleotide sequences encodeamino acid sequences, the concept of homology extendsdown to the level of individual nucleotide positions.Therefore, one of the first steps in studying the evolutionof genes or proteins is to align homologous positions inthe nucleotide or amino acid sequence of interest.Genes and proteins are compared throughsequence alignmentOnce the DNA or amino acid sequences of moleculesfrom different organisms have been determined, theycan be compared. Homologous positions can be identifiedonly if we first pinpoint the locations of deletions500 CHAPTER 24 | EVOLUTION OF GENES AND GENOMESTOOLS FOR INVESTIGATING LIFE24.1 Amino Acid Sequence AlignmentAmino acid sequence alignment is a way of arranging protein sequencesto identify regions of homology between the sequences. Gaps areinserted between the amino acid residues to align similar residues incolumns. Differences and similarities between each pair of alignedsequences are then summarized in a similarity matrix. Homologous DNAsequences can be aligned in a similar manner.leu arg phe cys cys ser argleu phe cys cys phe argleu arg phe cys cys ser argleu phe cys cys phe argTwo amino acid sequences seem quite different……but if we insert a gap in Sequence 2, there isnearly complete alignment.21Sequence 1Sequence 2Sequence 1Sequence 2leu arg phe cys cys ser argleu phe cys cys phe argleu phe cys cys phe argleu arg ile cys cys ser argleu arg ile cys ala ser argleu arg phe cys ile ser argWith this alignment established, we can compareadditional sequences.3Sequence 1Sequence 2Sequence 3Sequence 4Sequence 5Sequence 6Numbers above the diagonal lineare the number of differences.Numbers below the diagonalline are similarities.Sequence numberSequence number1 2 2 1 2 11 2 3 4 5 65 0 3 4 35 7 3 4 36 4 4 1 25 3 3 6 2623456 4 4 5 5Similarity matrixGO TO Web Activity 24.1 • Amino Acid Sequence AlignmentyourBioPortal.comand insertions that have occurred in the molecules of interest inthe time since the organisms diverged from a common ancestor.A simple hypothetical example illustrates this sequencealignment technique. In Figure 24.1 we compare two amino acidsequences (1 and 2) from homologous proteins in different organisms.The two sequences at first appear to differ in boththe number and identity of their amino acids, but if we inserta gap after the first amino acid in Sequence 2 (after leucine), similaritiesin the two sequences become more obvious. This gaprepresents the occurrence of one of two evolutionary events: aninsertion of an amino acid in the longer protein, or a deletion ofan amino acid in the shorter protein.Having adjusted for this insertion or deletion event, we cansee that the two sequences differ by only one amino acid atposition 6 (serine or phenylalanine). Adding a single gap—thatis, identifying a deletion or an insertion—aligns these sequences.Longer sequences and those that have diverged more extensivelyrequire more elaborate adjustments. Explicit models (incorporatedinto computer algorithms) have been developed toaccount for the relative probabilities of deletions, insertions, andparticular amino acid replacements.Having aligned the sequences, we can compare them bycounting the number of nucleotides or amino acids that differbetween them. Summing the number of similar and differentamino acids in each pair of sequences allows us to constructa similarity matrix, which gives us a measure of the minimumnumber of changes that have occurred during the divergencebetween each pair of organisms (see Figure 24.1).Models of sequence evolution are used to calculateevolutionary divergenceThe sequence comparison procedure illustrated in Figure 24.1gives a simple count of the number of differences and similaritiesbetween the proteins of two species. In the context of twoaligned DNA sequences, we can count the number of differencesat homologous nucleotide positions, and this count indicatesthe minimum number of nucleotide changes that musthave occurred since the two sequences diverged from a commonancestral sequence.Although it is useful in determining a minimum number ofchanges between two sequences, the count provided by sequencealignment almost certainly underestimates the actualnumber of changes that have occurred since the sequences diverged.Any given change counted in a similarity matrix ofDNA sequences may result from multiple substitution eventsthat occurred at a given nucleotide position over time. As illustratedin Figure 24.2, any of the following events may haveoccurred at a given nucleotide position that would not be revealedby a simple count of similarities and differences betweentwo DNA sequences:• Multiple substitutions. More than one change occurs at agiven position between the ancestral sequence and at leastone of the observed sequences.• Coincident substitutions. At a given position, different substitutionsoccur between the ancestral sequence and each observedsequence.• Parallel substitutions. The same substitution occurs independentlybetween the ancestral sequence and each observedsequence.• Back substitutions (also called reversions). In a variation onmultiple substitutions, after a change at a given position, asubsequent substitution changes the position back to theancestral state.To correct for undercounting of substitutions, molecular evolutionistshave developed mathematical models that describe howDNA (and protein) sequences evolve. These models take intoaccount the relative rates of change from one nucleotide to another;for example, transitions (changes between the twopurines, A↔G, or between the pyrimidines, C ↔ T) are morefrequent than transversions (a purine is replaced by a pyrimidine,or vice versa). Models also include parameters such as thedifferent rates of substitution across different parts of a geneand the proportions of each nucleotide present in a given sequence.Once such parameters have been estimated, the model24.1 | HOW ARE GENOMES USED TO STUDY EVOLUTION? 501ACGGTATTGCCGGCTATACGACGGTATTACGGGCTATAAncestralsequenceAT Single substitutionMultiple substitutionsCoincident substitutionsParallel substitutions*Back substitution(reversion)GGGATTTCCGGCTATAObservedsequence 2Observedsequence 1*GO TO Web Activity 24.2 • Similarity Matrix ConstructionyourBioPortal.com24.2 Multiple Substitutions Are Not Reflected in PairwiseSequence Comparisons Two observed sequences are descendedfrom a common ancestral sequence (center) through a series of substitutions.Although the two observed sequences differ in only threenucleotide differences (colored letters), these three differences resultedfrom a total of nine substitutions (arrows).is used to correct for multiple substitutions, coincident substitutions,parallel substitutions, and back substitutions. The revisedestimate accounts for the total number of substitutionslikely to have occurred between two sequences, which is almostalways greater than the observed number of differences.As sequence information becomes available for more andmore genes in an ever-expanding database, sequence alignmentscan be extended across multiple homologous sequences,and the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutionscan be summed across homologous genes of an entiregroup of organisms. Similar databases have also been constructedfor homologous proteins. Figure 24.3 shows aligneddata for cytochrome c protein sequences in 33 species of animals,plants, and fungi. Such information is used extensively indetermining evolutionary relationships among species.Experimental studies examine molecularevolution directlyAlthough molecular evolutionists are often interested in naturallyevolved genes and proteins, molecular and phenotypicevolution can also be observed directly in the laboratory. Increasingly,evolutionary biologists are studying evolution experimentally.Because substitution rates are related to generationtime rather than to absolute time, most of theseexperiments use unicellular organisms or viruses with shortgenerations. Viruses, bacteria, and unicellular eukaryotes (suchas the yeasts) can be cultured in large populations in the laboratory,and many of these organisms can evolve rapidly. Inthe case of some RNA viruses, the natural substitution rate maybe as high as 1 substitution per 1,000 nucleotides per generation.Therefore, in a virus of a few thousand nucleotides, one502 CHAPTER 24 | EVOLUTION OF GENES AND GENOMESThe number 1 indicates an invariant position in thecytochrome c molecule (i.e., all the organisms havethe same amino acid in this position).

Alphahelixes are in red, and the molecule’s heme group is shown in yellow.or more substitutions are expected (on average) every generation,and these changes can easily be determined by sequencingthe entire genome (because of its small size). Generationtime may be only tens of minutes (rather than years or decades,as in humans), so biologists can directly observe substantialmolecular evolution in a controlled population over the courseof days, weeks, or months.An example of an experimental evolutionary study is shownin Figure 24.4. Paul Rainey and Michael Travisano wanted to examinea potential cause of adaptive radiations, which are a majorsource of biological diversity (see Section 23.4). For instance,near the beginning of the Cenozoic era, mammals rapidly diversifiedinto species as diverse as elephants, moles, whales, andbats. While Rainey and Travisano clearly couldn’t experimentallymanipulate mammals over many millions of years, they couldtest the idea that heterogeneous environments with unoccupiedniches lead to adaptive radiation by experimentally manipulatinga bacterial lineage.Rainey and Travisano inoculated several flasks containingculture medium with the same strain of the bacteriumPseudomonas fluorescens. They then shook some of the culturesto maintain a constantly uniform environment. Others they leftalone (static cultures), allowing them to develop a spatially distinctstructure. In the static cultures, the environment on the surfacefilm of the medium differed from that on the walls of theflasks and from parts of the culture not touching any surfaces.When the cultures were started, the ancestral phenotype ofthe bacterium produced a smooth colony, which the investigatorscalled a “smooth morph.” In just a few days, however, thestatic cultures consistently and independently developed twoother morphs: a “wrinkly spreader” and a “fuzzy spreader.” Theresearchers determined that the two new morphs had a geneticbasis and were adaptively superior in some of the environmentsfound within the static cultures. For example, the “wrinklyspreader” cells adhered firmly to one another as well as to surfaces,and thus were able to form a mat across the surface ofthe medium, where they could compete successfully for oxygen.DNA sequencing of the genomes of these morphs showedthat the same phenotypes had evolved repeatedly, and thatmany different substitutions could produce the same phenotypes.The homogeneous shaken cultures, in contrast, showedno evolution in phenotype.

Biologists now routinely study evolution in the laboratoryand, as we will see later in this chapter, use in vitro evolutionarytechniques to produce novel molecules that performnew functions with industrial and pharmaceutical uses.504 CHAPTER 24 | EVOLUTION OF GENES AND GENOMESINVESTIGATING LIFEMETHODRESULTS24.4 Evolution in a Heterogeneous EnvironmentRainey and Travisano cultured the rapidly evolving bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in homogeneous andheterogeneous environments to examine the relationship between phenotypic diversity and environmental variability.CONCLUSION Phenotypic change and diversification are enhanced in a heterogeneous environment.HYPOTHESIS Heterogeneous environments are more conducive to the evolution of phenotypic diversity than are homogeneousenvironments.FURTHER INVESTIGATION: Do you think the two evolved phenotypes could compete in the homogeneous environment if they were introducedafter having become successfully established in the heterogeneous environment?

In thestatic flasks, two new morphotypes regularly arose, each adapted to a different local environment. Molecular analysis revealedthat the mutations that produce these phenotypes arose in both shaken and static cultures, but the mutations did not persistin the uniform (shaken) environment because the phenotypes they produced were selectively disadvantageous under homogeneousconditions.Smooth morph (ancestral) “Wrinkly spreader” “Fuzzy spreader”24.1 RECAPThe genomes of all organisms evolve over time, ascan be detected by direct observation in the laboratory,as well as by aligning genes and proteins betweenspecies. Experimental studies of molecularevolution allow biologists to study many processesof evolution directly under controlled conditions.• How do biologists align nucleotide and amino acidsequences they wish to compare, and how do theycalculate the minimum number of changes that haveoccurred between pairs of aligned sequences?See pp. 500–501 and Figure 24.1• Explain why a simple count of nucleotide differencesbetween two sequences underestimates the actualnumber of nucleotide substitutions since the sequencesdiverged. See Figure 24.2We have seen that molecular evolutionists can directly observethe evolution of genomes over time, and can compare thegenomes of different organisms and reconstruct the changesthat have occurred during their evolution. Let’s turn now to thequestion of how genomes change and examine some of the consequencesof those changes.What Do Genomes Reveal About 24.2 Evolutionary Processes?A mutation, as we saw in Chapter 15, is any change in the geneticmaterial. A nucleotide substitution is one type of mutation.Many nucleotide substitutions have no effect on phenotype,even if the change occurs in a gene that encodes a protein,because most amino acids are specified by more than one codon(see Figure 14.6). A substitution that does not change the encodedamino acid is known as a synonymous substitution orsilent substitution (Figure 24.5A). Synonymous substitutions donot affect the functioning of a protein (although they may haveother effects, such as changes in mRNA stability or translationrates; see Section 14.5), and are therefore less likely to be influencedby natural selection.Anucleotide substitution that does change the amino acid sequenceencoded by a gene is known as a nonsynonymous substitution,also known as a missense substitution (Figure 24.5B). Ingeneral, nonsynonymous substitutions are more likely to bedeleterious to the organism. But not every amino acid replacementalters a protein’s shape and charge (and hence its functionalproperties). Therefore, some nonsynonymous substitutionsmay also be selectively neutral, or nearly so. Conversely,an amino acid replacement that confers an advantage to the organismwould result in positive selection for the correspondingnonsynonymous substitution.The rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions in severalmammalian protein-coding genes is about 3 × 10–9 substitutionsper position per year. Synonymous substitutions in thesegenes have occurred about five times more frequently than nonsynonymoussubstitutions. In other words, substitution rates arehighest at nucleotide positions that do not change the amino acid beingexpressed (Figure 24.6). The rate of substitution is even higherin pseudogenes, which are duplicate copies of genes that are nolonger functional.As we saw Chapter 21, most natural populations harbor farmore genetic variation than we would expect to find if genetic24.2 | WHAT DO GENOMES REVEAL ABOUT EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES? 505This substitution would resultin an incomplete protein.UUA ACU UUAUUA UGG GGAUUC UGAStoptranslationAGAUUG ACA CUASynonymoussubstitutionsNonsynonymoussubstitutions(A)(B)leu thr leuleu thr leuleu trp glyphe arg24.5 When One Nucleotide Does or Doesn’t Make a Difference(A) Synonymous substitutions do not change the amino acid specified anddo not affect protein function; such substitutions are less likely to be subjectto natural selection. (B) Nonsynonymous substitutions do change theamino acid sequence and are likely to have an effect (often deleterious) onprotein function; such substitutions are targets for natural selection.Rates of substitution are high wherechanges have little effect on function……and are low wheresubstitutions change theamino acid being expressed.0NonsynonymoussubstitutionsSynonymoussubstitutionsPseudogenes1 2 3 4Substitutions per nucleotide siteper 10 million years24.6 Rates of Substitution Differ Rates of nonsynonymous substitutiontypically are much lower than rates of synonymous substitution andthe substitution rate in pseudogenes. This pattern reflects differing levelsof functional constraints.variation were influenced by natural selection alone. This discovery,combined with the knowledge that many mutations donot change molecular function, stimulated the development ofthe neutral theory of molecular evolution.Much of evolution is neutralIn 1968, Motoo Kimura proposed the neutral theory of molecularevolution. Kimura suggested that, at the molecular level, themajority of variants we observe in most populations are selectivelyneutral; that is, they confer neither an advantage nora disadvantage on their bearers. Therefore, these neutral variantsaccumulate through genetic drift rather than through positiveselection.The rate of fixation of neutral mutations by genetic driftis independent of population size. To see why this is so, considera population of size N and a neutral mutation rate μ(mu) per gamete per generation at a locus. The number of newmutations would be, on average, μ × 2N, because 2N genecopies are available to mutate in a population of diploid organisms.The probability that a given mutation will be fixedby drift alone is its frequency, which equals 1/(2N) for anewly arisen mutation. We can multiply these two terms toget the rate of fixation of neutral mutations in a given populationof N individuals:2Nμ 1—2N = μTherefore, the rate of fixation of neutral mutations dependsonly on the neutral mutation rate μ and is independent of populationsize. Agiven mutation is more likely to appear in a largepopulation than in a small one, but any mutation that does appearis more likely to become fixed in a small population. Thesetwo influences of population size cancel each other out.Therefore, the rate of fixation of neutral mutations is equalto the mutation rate. As long as the underlying mutation rate isconstant, macromolecules evolving in different populationsshould diverge from one another in neutral changes at a constantrate. Empirically, the rate of evolution of particular genesand proteins is often relatively constant over time, and thereforecan be used as a “molecular clock.” As we described in Section22.3, molecular clocks can be used to calculate evolutionarydivergence times between species.Although much of the genetic variation we observe in populationsis the result of neutral evolution, the neutral theorydoes not imply that most mutations have no effect on the organism.Many mutations are never observed in populations becausethey are lethal or strongly detrimental to the organismand are thus quickly removed from the population through naturalselection. Similarly, mutations that confer a selective advantagetend to be quickly fixed in populations, so they do notresult in variation at the population level either. Nonetheless, ifwe compare homologous proteins from different populationsor species, some amino acid positions will remain constant underpurifying selection, others will vary through neutral geneticdrift, and still others will differ between species as a result ofpositive selection for change. How can these evolutionaryprocesses be distinguished?Positive and purifying selection can be detectedin the genomeAs we have just seen, substitutions in a protein-coding gene canbe either synonymous or nonsynonymous, depending onwhether they change the resulting amino acid sequence of theprotein. The relative rates of synonymous and nonsynonymoussubstitutions are expected to differ in regions of genes that areevolving neutrally, under positive selection for change, or stayingunchanged under purifying selection.• If a given amino acid in a protein can be one of many alternatives(without changing the protein’s function), then anamino acid replacement is neutral with respect to the fitnessof an organism. In this case, the rates of synonymous andnonsynonymous substitutions in the corresponding DNAsequences are expected to be very similar, so the ratio of thetwo rates would be close to 1.• If a given amino acid position is under positive selection forchange, the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions is expectedto exceed the rate of synonymous substitutions inthe corresponding DNA sequences.• If a given amino acid position is under purifying selection,then the rate of synonymous substitutions in the correspondingDNA sequences is expected to be much higher thanthe rate of nonsynonymous substitutions.By comparing the gene sequences that encode proteins frommany species, scientists can determine the history and timingof synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions. This informationcan be mapped on a phylogenetic tree, as we saw inChapter 22.Regions of genes that are evolving under neutral, purifying,or positive selection can be identified by comparing the natureand rates of substitutions across the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionof lysozyme illustrates how and why particular positionsof a gene sequence might be under different modes of selection.The enzyme lysozyme (see Figure 3.8) is found in almost allanimals. It is produced in the tears, saliva, and milk of mammalsand in the albumen (whites) of bird eggs. Lysozyme digeststhe cell walls of bacteria, rupturing and killing them. Asa result, it plays an important role as a first line of defenseagainst invading bacteria. Most animals defend themselvesagainst bacteria by digesting them, which is probably why mostanimals have lysozyme. Some animals also use lysozyme in thedigestion of food.Among mammals, a mode of digestion called foregut fermentationhas evolved twice. In mammals with this mode of digestion,the foregut—the posterior esophagus and/or the stomach—has been converted into a chamber in which bacteria breakdown ingested plant matter by fermentation. Foregut fermenterscan obtain nutrients from the otherwise indigestiblecellulose that makes up a large proportion of plant tissue.Foregut fermentation evolved independently in ruminants (agroup of hoofed mammals that includes cattle) and in certainleaf-eating monkeys, such as langurs. We know these evolutionaryevents were independent, because both langurs and ruminantshave close relatives that are not foregut fermenters.506 CHAPTER 24 | EVOLUTION OF GENES AND GENOMESIn both foregut-fermenting lineages, the enzyme lysozymehas been modified to play a new, nondefensive role. Thislysozyme ruptures some of the bacteria that live in the foregut,releasing nutrients metabolized by the bacteria, which the mammalthen absorbs. How many changes in the lysozyme moleculewere needed to allow it to perform this function amid thedigestive enzymes and acidic conditions of the mammalianforegut? To answer this question, molecular evolutionists comparedthe lysozyme-coding sequences in foregut fermenterswith those in several of their nonfermenting relatives. They determinedwhich amino acids differed and which were sharedamong the species (Figure 24.7A), as well as the rates of synonymousand nonsynonymous substitutions in lysozyme genesacross the evolutionary history of the sampled species.For many of the amino acid positions of lysozyme, the rateof synonymous substitutions (in the corresponding gene) ismuch higher than the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions.This observation indicates that many of the amino acids thatmake up lysozyme are evolving under purifying selection. Inother words, there is selection against change in the protein atthese positions, and the observed amino acids must thereforebe critical for lysozyme function. At other positions, several differentamino acids function equally well, and the correspondingregions of the genes have similar rates of synonymous and nonsynonymoussubstitutions. The most striking finding is thatamino acid replacements in lysozyme happened at a muchhigher rate in the lineage leading to langurs than in any otherprimates. The high rate of nonsynonymous substitutions in thelangur lysozyme gene shows that lysozyme went through a periodof rapid change in adapting to the stomachs of langurs.Moreover, the lysozymes of langurs and cattle share five aminoacid replacements, all of which lie on the surface of thelysozyme molecule, well away from the enzyme’s active site.Several of these shared replacements involve changes from arginineto lysine, which makes the proteins more resistant to attackby the stomach enzyme pepsin. By understanding the functionalsignificance of amino acid replacements, molecular evolutionistscan explain the observed changes in amino acid sequencesin terms of changes in the functioning of the protein.A large body of fossil, morphological, and molecular evidenceshows that langurs and cattle do not share a recent commonancestor. However, langur and ruminant lysozymes shareseveral amino acids that neither mammal shares with thelysozymes of its own closer relatives. The lysozymes of thesetwo mammals have undergone evolutionary convergence at someamino acid positions despite their very different ancestry. Theamino acids they share give these lysozymes the ability to lysethe bacteria that ferment plant material in the foregut.The hoatzin, an unusual leaf-eating South American bird andthe only known avian foregut fermenter, offers another remarkablestory of the convergent evolution of lysozyme (Figure24.7B). Many birds have an enlarged esophageal chamber calleda crop. The crop of the hoatzin contains lysozyme and bacteriaand acts as a fermenting chamber.

Thus, even though the hoatzin and foregut-fermentingmammals have not shared a common ancestor in hundreds ofmillions of years, they have all evolved similar adaptations intheir lysozymes that enable them to recover nutrients from theirfermenting bacteria.Genome size and organization also evolveWe know that genome size varies tremendously among organisms.Across broad taxonomic categories, there is some correlationbetween genome size and organismal complexity.

Rickettsia prowazekii, the bacterium that causes typhus,has 634 genes. Homo sapiens, by contrast, has about 23,000 protein-coding genes. Figure 24.8 shows the number of genes froma sample of organisms with fully sequenced genomes, arrangedby their evolutionary relationships. As this figure reveals, however,a larger genome does not always indicate greater complexity(compare rice to the other plants, for example). It is not surprisingthat more complex genetic instructions are needed forbuilding and maintaining a large, multicellular organism than asmall, single-celled bacterium. What is surprising is that someorganisms, such as lungfishes, some salamanders, and lilies,have about 40 times as much DNA as humans do. Structurally,a lungfish or a lily is not 40 times more complex than a human.So why does genome size vary so much?Differences in genome size are not so great if we take into accountonly the portion of DNA that actually encodes RNAs orproteins. The organisms with the largest total amounts of nuclearDNA (some ferns and flowering plants) have 80,000 timesas much DNA as do the bacteria with the smallest genomes, butno species has more than about 100 times as many protein-codinggenes as a bacterium. Therefore, much of the variation ingenome size lies not in the number of functional genes but inthe amount of noncoding DNA (Figure 24.9).Why do the cells of most eukaryotic organisms have somuch noncoding DNA? Does this noncoding DNA have afunction, or is it “junk”? Although some of this DNA does notappear to have a direct function, it can alter the expression ofthe surrounding genes. The degree or timing of gene expressioncan be changed dramatically depending on the gene’s positionrelative to noncoding sequences. Other regions of noncodingDNA consist of pseudogenes that are simply carriedin the genome because the cost of doing so is very small. Thesepseudogenes may become the raw material for the evolutionof new genes with novel functions. Some noncoding sequencesfunction in maintaining chromosomal structure. Still othersconsist of parasitic transposable elements that spread throughpopulations because they reproduce faster than the hostgenome.508 CHAPTER 24 | EVOLUTION OF GENES AND GENOMESTrypanosoma (sleeping sickness)Leishmania (leishmaniasis)Thalassiosira (diatom)H. influenzae (inner ear infections)E. coli (gut bacterium) ProkaryotesPlantsFungiAnimalsEukaryotesMethanococcus (archaean)Plasmodium (malaria)Cyanidioschyzon (red alga)Oryza (rice)Arabidopsis (cress)Lotus (legume)Ustilago (smut fungus)Schizosaccharomyces (yeast)Neurospora (bread mold)Saccharomyces (yeast)Caenorhabditis (nematode)Anopheles (mosquito)Drosophila (fruit fly)Bombyx (silk worm)Ciona (tunicate)Fugu (puffer fish)Gallus (chicken)Mus (mouse)Homo (human)0 10 20 30 40 50 60Number of genes (x 1,000)Commonancestor24.8 Genome Size Varies Widely This figure shows the numberof genes from a sample of organisms with fully sequenced genomes,arranged by their evolutionary relationships. Bacteria and archaeatypically have fewer genes than most eukaryotes. Among eukaryotes,multicellular organisms with tissue organization (plants and animals; bluebranches) have more genes than single-celled organisms (red branches)or multicellular organisms that lack pronounced tissue organization(green branches).Investigators can use retrotransposons to estimate the rates atwhich species lose DNA. Retrotransposons are transposable elements(see Figure 17.5) that copy themselves through an RNAintermediate.The most common type of retrotransposon carriesduplicated sequences at each end, called long terminal repeats,or LTRs. Occasionally, LTRs recombine in the host genome, sothat the DNA between them is excised. When this happens, onerecombined LTR is left behind. The number of such “orphaned”LTRs in a genome is a measure of how many retrotransposonshave been lost. By comparing the number of LTRs in the genomesof Hawaiian crickets (Laupala) and fruit flies (Drosophila), investigatorsfound that Laupala loses DNA more than 40 times moreslowly than does Drosophila. Therefore, it is not surprising thatthe genome of Laupala is much larger than that of Drosophila.Why do species differ so greatly in the rate at which they gainor lose apparently functionless DNA? One hypothesis is thatgenome size is related to the rate at which the organism develops,which may be under selection pressure. Large genomes canslow down the rate of development and thus alter the relativetiming of expression of particular genes. As discussed in Section20.2, changes in the timing of gene expression (heterochrony)can produce major changes in phenotype. Thus, although somenoncoding DNA sequences may have no direct function, theymay still affect the development of the organism.Another hypothesis is that the proportion of noncodingDNA is related primarily to population size. Noncoding sequencesthat are only slightly deleterious to the organism arelikely to be purged by selection most efficiently in species withlarge population sizes. In species with small populations, theeffects of genetic drift can overwhelm selection against noncodingsequences that have small deleterious consequences.Therefore, selection against the accumulation of noncoding sequencesis most effective in species with large populations, sosuch species (such as bacteria or yeasts) have relatively littlenoncoding DNA compared with species with small populations(see Figure 24.9).24.2 RECAPBy examining the relative rates of synonymous andnonsynonymous substitutions in genes across evolutionaryhistory, biologists can distinguish the evolutionarymechanisms acting on individual genes.Neutral theory provides an explanation for the relativelyconstant rate of molecular change seen inmany species.• Describe how the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymoussubstitutions can be used to determine whethera particular gene region is evolving neutrally, underpositive selection, or under stabilizing selection.See pp. 505–506 and Figure 24.6• Contrast two hypotheses for the wide diversity ofgenome sizes among different organisms. See pp.508–509We have examined some of the ways that biologists can usegenomes to study the molecular mechanisms of evolution. Buthow do organisms gain new functions through time?How Do Genomes Gain and 24.3 Maintain Functions?As we noted in the previous section, most multicellular organismshave many more genes than do most unicellular species.But multicellular organisms evolved from unicellular ancestors.Therefore, some mechanisms must exist that result in the increaseof gene numbers within genomes over evolutionary time.There are two primary ways to accomplish this increase: genescan be transferred from other species, or genes can be duplicatedwithin species.Lateral gene transfer can result in the gainof new functionsIn Chapter 22, we noted that the tree of life is usually visualizedas a branching diagram, with each lineage dividing intotwo (or more) lineages through time, from one common ancestorto the millions of species that are alive today. Chapter 23described how, in the process of speciation, ancestral lineagesdivide into descendant lineages, and it is those speciationevents that the tree of life captures. However, there are alsoprocesses of lateral gene transfer, which allow individual genes,organelles, or fragments of genomes to move horizontally fromone lineage to another. Some species may pick up fragments ofDNA directly from the environment. Other genes may bepicked up in a viral genome and then transferred to a new hostwhen the virus becomes integrated in the new host’s genome.Hybridization between species also results in the transfer oflarge numbers of genes.Lateral gene transfer can be highly advantageous to thespecies that incorporates novel genes from a distant relative.Genes that confer antibiotic resistance, for example, are com-24.3 | HOW DO GENOMES GAIN AND MAINTAIN FUNCTIONS? 5090.001020406080Percent of genome encoding functional genes0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000100Genome size (× 109 base pairs)E. coliYeastDrosophilaC. elegansArabidopsisHumanSalamanderLilyLungfish24.9 A Large Proportion of DNA Is Noncoding Most of the DNA ofbacteria and yeasts encodes RNAs or proteins, but a large percentage ofthe DNA of multicellular species is noncoding.monly transferred among different species of bacteria. Lateralgene transfer is another way, in addition to mutation and recombination,that species can increase their genetic variability.Genetic variability then provides the raw material on which selectionacts, resulting in evolution.A phylogenetic tree constructed from a single laterallytransferred genome fragment is likely to reflect only that transferevent, rather than the overall organismal phylogeny (seeSection 26.3). Most biologists prefer to build trees from largesamples of genes or their products, so that the underlyingspecies tree (as well as any lateral gene transfer events) can bereconstructed. The depiction of lateral gene transfer events onthe underlying species tree are known as reticulations on thephylogenetic tree.The degree to which lateral gene transfer events occur invarious parts of the tree of life is a matter of considerable currentinvestigation and debate. Lateral gene transfer appears tobe relatively uncommon among most eukaryote lineages, althoughthe two major endosymbioses that gave rise to mitochondriaand chloroplasts can be viewed as lateral transfersof entire bacteria genomes to the eukaryote lineage. Somegroups of eukaryotes, most notably some plants, are subjectto relatively high levels of hybridization among closely relatedspecies. Hybridization leads to the exchange of many genesamong recently separated lineages of plants. The greatest degreeof lateral transfer, however, appears to occur amongspecies of bacteria. Many bacteria genes have been transferredrepeatedly among lineages of bacteria, to the point that relationshipsamong the bacteria species are often hard to decipher.Nonetheless, the broad relationships of the major groupsof bacteria can still be determined (as we will discuss in PartSeven of this book). Lateral transfer of genes makes it difficultto identify the boundaries of bacteria species, which is one reasonwhy fewer bacteria species have been named than areknown to exist.Most new functions arise following gene duplicationGene duplication is yet another way in which genomes can acquirenew functions. When a gene is duplicated, one copy ofthat gene is potentially freed from having to perform its originalfunction. The identical copies of a duplicated gene can haveany one of four different fates:• Both copies of the gene may retain their original function(which can result in a change in the amount of gene productthat is produced by the organism).• Both copies of the gene may retain the ability to producethe original gene product, but the expression of the genesmay diverge in different tissues or at different times of development.• One copy of the gene may be incapacitated by the accumulationof deleterious substitutions and become a functionlesspseudogene.• One copy of the gene may retain its original function whilethe second copy accumulates enough substitutions that itcan perform a different function.How often do gene duplications arise, and which of these fouroutcomes is most likely? Investigators have found that rates ofgene duplication are fast enough for a yeast or Drosophila populationto acquire several hundred duplicate genes over thecourse of a million years. They have also found that most of theduplicated genes in these organisms are very young. Many extragenes are lost from a genome within 10 million years (whichis rapid on an evolutionary time scale).Many gene duplications affect only one or a few genes at atime, but entire genomes are often duplicated in polyploid organisms(including many plants). When all the genes are duplicated,there are massive opportunities for new functions toevolve. That is exactly what appears to have happened in theevolution of vertebrates. The genomes of the jawed vertebratesappear to have four diploid sets of many major genes, whichleads biologists to believe that two genome-wide duplicationevents occurred in the ancestor of these species. These duplicationshave allowed considerable specialization of individualvertebrate genes, many of which are now highly tissue-specificin their expression. A good example is the duplication ofsodium channel genes, which allowed the evolution of the electricorgans of electric fishes described in the opening of thischapter.Although many extra genes disappear rapidly, some duplicationevents lead to the evolution of genes with new functions.Several successive rounds of duplication and mutation may resultin a gene family, a group of homologous genes with relatedfunctions, often arrayed in tandem along a chromosome. An exampleof this process is provided by the globin gene family (seeFigure 17.10). The globins were among the first proteins to besequenced and compared. Comparisons of their amino acid sequencesstrongly suggest that the different globins arose viagene duplications. These comparisons can also tell us how longthe globins have been evolving separately, because differencesamong these proteins have accumulated with time.Hemoglobin, a tetramer (four-subunit molecule) consistingof two α-globin and two β-globin polypeptide chains, carriesoxygen in blood. Myoglobin, a monomer, is the primary O2 storageprotein in muscle. Myoglobin’s affinity for O2 is muchhigher than that of hemoglobin, but hemoglobin has evolved tobe more diversified in its role. Hemoglobin binds O2 in the lungsor gills, where the O2 concentration is relatively high, transportsit to deep body tissues, where the O2 concentration is low, andreleases it in those tissues. With its more complex tetramericstructure, hemoglobin is able to carry four molecules of O2, aswell as hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide, in the blood.To estimate the time of the globin gene duplication that gaverise to the α- and β-globin gene clusters, we can create a phylogenetictree of the gene sequences that encode the variousglobins (Figure 24.10). The rate of molecular evolution of globingenes has been estimated from other studies, using the divergencetimes of groups of vertebrates that are well documentedin the fossil record. These studies indicate an averagerate of divergence for globin genes of about 1 nucleotide substitutionevery 2 million years. Applying this rate to the genetree, the two globin gene clusters are estimated to have splitabout 450 million years ago.510 CHAPTER 24 | EVOLUTION OF GENES AND GENOMESSome gene families evolve through concerted evolutionAlthough the members of the globin gene family have diversifiedin form and function, the members of many other gene familiesdo not evolve independently of one another. For instance,almost all organisms have many copies (up to thousands) of theribosomal RNA genes. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the principalstructural element of ribosomes and, as such, has a primary rolein protein synthesis. Every living species needs to synthesizeproteins, often in large amounts (especially during early development).Having many copies of the rRNA genes ensures thatorganisms can rapidly produce many ribosomes and therebymaintain a high rate of protein synthesis.Like all portions of the genome, ribosomal RNA genesevolve, and differences accumulate in the rRNA genes of differentspecies. But within any one species, the multiple copies ofrRNAgenes are very similar, both structurally and functionally.This similarity makes sense, because ideally every ribosome ina species should synthesize proteins in the same way. In otherwords, within a given species, the multiple copies of these rRNAgenes are evolving in concert with one another, a phenomenoncalled concerted evolution.How does concerted evolution occur? There must be one ormore mechanisms to cause a substitution in one copy to spreadto other copies in a species so that all of the copies remain similar.In fact, two different mechanisms appear to be responsiblefor concerted evolution. The first of these is unequal crossingover. When DNA is replicated during meiosis in a diploidspecies, the homologous chromosome pairs align and recombineby crossing over (see Section 11.4).In the case of highly repeated genes, however, it is easy forgenes to become displaced in alignment, since so many copiesof the same genes are present in the repeats (Figure 24.11A). Theend result is that one chromosome will gain extra copies of therepeat and the other chromosome will have fewer copies of therepeat. If a new substitution arises in one copy of the repeat, itcan spread to new copies (or be eliminated) through unequalcrossing over. Thus, over time, a novel substitution will eitherbecome fixed or lost entirely from the repeat. In either case, allthe copies of the repeat will remain very similar to one another.The second mechanism that produces concerted evolution isbiased gene conversion. This mechanism can be much faster thanunequal crossing over, and has been shown to be the primarymechanism for concerted evolution of rRNA genes. DNAstrands break often, and are repaired by the DNA repair systemsof cells (see Section 13.4). At many times during the cellcycle, the genes for ribosomal RNA are clustered close together.If damage occurs to one of the genes, a copy of the rRNA geneon another chromosome may be used to repair the damagedcopy, and the sequence that is used as a template can therebyreplace the original sequence (Figure 24.11B). In many cases,this repair system appears to be biased in favor of using particularsequences as templates for repair, and thus the favoredsequence rapidly spreads across all copies of the gene. In thisway, changes may appear in a single copy and then rapidlyspread to all the other copies.Regardless of the mechanism responsible, the net result ofconcerted evolution is that the copies of a highly repeated genedo not evolve independently of one another. Mutations still oc-24.3 | HOW DO GENOMES GAIN AND MAINTAIN FUNCTIONS? 511Millions of years agoNumbers indicate the estimatednumber of DNA sequence changesalong that branch of a tree.AncestralmyoglobinlikemoleculeMyoglobinAlpha chains(α1, α2)Zeta chain(ζ)Epsilon chain(ε)Gamma chains(Aγ, Gγ)Delta chain(δ)Beta chain(β)49 76636257178120812732911α family subunitsMyoglobinβ family subunitsHemoglobin500 400 300 200 100 Present24.10 A Globin Family Gene Tree This gene tree suggests that theα-globin and β-globin gene clusters diverged about 450 million years ago(open circle), soon after the origin of the vertebrates.GO TO Web Activity 24.3 • Gene Tree ConstructionyourBioPortal.comcur, but once they arise in one copy, they either spread rapidlyacross all the copies or are lost from the genome completely. Thisprocess allows the products of each copy to remain similarthrough time in both sequence and function.24.3 RECAPGene duplication can lead to the evolution of newfunctions. Lateral gene transfer can result in thespread of genetic functions between distantly relatedspecies. Some highly repeated genes evolve inconcert, which maintains uniform functionality.• Explain the potential advantages of lateral genetransfer.

See p. 511 andFigure 24.11We have seen how the principles and methods of molecular evolutionhave opened new vistas in evolutionary science. Nowlet’s consider some of the practical applications of this field.What Are Some Applications 24.4 of Molecular Evolution?Our understanding of molecular biology has helped revealhow biological molecules function as well as howthey diversify. Such knowledge allows scientists to createnew molecules with novel functions in the laboratory,and to understand and treat disease.Molecular sequence data are used todetermine the evolutionary history of genesA gene tree shows the evolutionary relationships of asingle gene in different species or of the members of agene family (as in Figure 24.10). The methods for constructinga gene tree are the same as those we describedin Section 22.2 for building phylogenetic trees of species.The process involves identifying differences betweengenes and using those differences to reconstruct the evolutionaryhistory of the genes. Gene trees are often usedto infer phylogenetic trees of species, but the two typesof trees are not necessarily equivalent. Processes suchas gene duplication can give rise to differences betweenthe phylogenetic trees of genes and species. From a genetree, biologists can reconstruct the history and timing of geneduplication events and learn how gene diversification has resultedin the evolution of new protein functions.All of the genes of a particular gene family have similar sequencesbecause they have a common ancestry. As we discussedin Section 22.1, features that are similar as a result of commonancestry are referred to as homologs of one another. When discussinggene trees, however, we usually need to distinguish betweentwo forms of homology. Genes found in different species,and whose divergence we can trace to the speciation events thatgave rise to various species, are called orthologs. Genes in thesame or different species that are related through gene duplicationevents are called paralogs. When we examine a gene tree,the questions we wish to address determine whether we shouldcompare orthologous or paralogous genes. If we wish to reconstructthe evolutionary history of the species that contain thegenes, then our comparison should be restricted to orthologs(because they will reflect the history of speciation events). If weare interested in the changes in function that have resulted fromgene duplication events, however, then the appropriate comparisonis among paralogs (because they will reflect the historyof gene duplication events). If our focus is on the diversificationof a gene family through both processes, then we will want toinclude both paralogs and orthologs in our analysis.Figure 24.12 depicts a gene tree for the members of a genefamily called engrailed (its members encode transcription factors512 CHAPTER 24 | EVOLUTION OF GENES AND GENOMESTwo different sequences of a highlyrepeated gene, represented by red andblue boxes, are present on a chromosome.Crossing over occursbetween misalignedrepeats on homologouschromosomes……resulting in onechromosome withmore and one withfewer copies of thered sequence.321Damage occurs to the DNAof one copy of the gene.Damage is repaired usingthe sequence indicated byred (on a homologouschromosome) as a template……resulting in onechromosome with morecopies of the red sequence.321(A) Unequal crossing over(B) Biased gene conversionDNA24.11 Concerted Evolution Two mechanisms can produce concerted evolution ofhighly repeated genes.

At least three gene duplications haveoccurred in this family, resulting in up to four different engrailedgenes (En) in some vertebrate species (such as the zebrafish).All of the engrailed genes are homologs because they have a commonancestor. Gene duplication events have generated paralogousengrailed genes in some lineages of vertebrates. We couldcompare the orthologous sequences of the En1 group of genes toreconstruct the history of the bony vertebrates (i.e., all the speciesin Figure 24.12 except the lamprey), or we could use the orthologoussequences of the En2 group of genes and expect the sameanswer (because there is only one history of the underlying speciationevents). All bony vertebrates have both groups of engrailedgenes because the two groups arose from a gene duplicationevent in the common ancestor of bony vertebrates. If we wantedto focus on the diversification that occurred as a result of this duplication,then the appropriate comparison would be betweenthe paralogous genes of the En1 versus En2 groups.Gene evolution is used to study protein functionEarlier in this chapter we discussed the ways in which biologistscan detect regions of genes that are under positive selection forchange. What are the practical uses of this information? Considerthe evolution of the family of gated sodium channel genes,which we introduced in the opening of this chapter. Sodiumchannels have many functions, including the control of nerveimpulses in the nervous system. Sodium channels can becomeblocked by various toxins, such as the tetrodotoxin that is presentin puffer fishes and many other animals. Ahuman who eatsthe tissues of a puffer fish that contain tetrodotoxin can becomeparalyzed and die, because the tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channelsand prevents nerves and muscles from functioning.Puffer fish themselves have sodium channels; so why doesn’tthe tetrodotoxin cause paralysis in a puffer fish? The sodiumchannels of puffer fish (and other animals that sequestertetrodotoxin) have evolved to become resistant to the toxin.Nucleotide substitutions in the puffer fish genome have resultedin changes to the proteins that make up sodium channels,and those changes prevent tetrodotoxin from binding tothe sodium channel pore and blocking it. Several different substitutionsthat result in tetrodotoxin resistance have evolved inthe various duplicated sodium channel genes of the manyspecies of puffer fish.Many other changes that have nothing to do with the evolutionof tetrodotoxin resistance have occurred in these genes aswell. Biologists who study the function of sodium channels canlearn a great deal about how the channels work (and about neurologicaldiseases that are caused by mutations in the sodiumchannel genes) by understanding which changes have been selectedfor tetrodotoxin resistance. They can do this by comparingthe rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutionsacross the genes in various lineages that have evolved tetrodo-24.4 | WHAT ARE SOME APPLICATIONS OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION? 513Sea urchin EnAmphioxus EnLamprey EnZebrafish Eng2bZebrafish Eng2aChicken En2Mouse En2Human En2Zebrafish Eng1bZebrafish Eng1aChicken En1Mouse En1Human En1AncestralengrailedgeneEn2En1In vertebrates, a geneduplication event resultedin two paralogous engrailedgenes, En1 and En2.Within orthologous groups of genes, therelationships among the species are thesame (compare the relationships of En1genes to those of En2 genes).These species have asingle engrailed gene.Additional gene duplicationsoccurred in the zebrafish lineage.24.12 Phylogeny of the engrailed GenesThe engrailed genes are homologous becausethey share a common ancestor. Speciation eventshave generated orthologous engrailed genes, andgene duplication events (open circles) have generatedparalogous engrailed genes among bonyvertebrates.toxin resistance. In a similar manner, molecular evolutionary principlesare used to understand function and diversification of functionin many other proteins.As biologists studied the relationship between selection, evolution,and function in macromolecules, they realized that molecularevolution could be used in a controlled laboratory environmentto produce new molecules with novel and usefulfunctions. Thus were born the applications of in vitro evolution.In vitro evolution produces new moleculesLiving organisms produce thousands of compounds that humanshave found useful. The search for such naturally occurring compounds,which can be used for pharmaceutical, agricultural, orindustrial purposes, has been termed bioprospecting. These compoundsare the result of millions of years of molecular evolutionacross millions of species of living organisms. Yet biologists canimagine molecules that could have evolved but have not, lackingthe right combination of selection pressures and opportunities.For instance, we might like to have a molecule that binds aparticular environmental contaminant so that it can be easilyisolated and extracted from the environment. But if the environmentalcontaminant is synthetic (not produced naturally),then it is unlikely that any living organism would have evolveda molecule with the function we desire. This problem was theinspiration for the field of in vitro evolution, in which new moleculesare produced in the laboratory to perform novel and usefulfunctions.The principles of in vitro evolution are based on the principlesof molecular evolution that we have learned from the naturalworld. Consider the evolution of a new RNA molecule thatwas produced in the laboratory using the principles of mutationand selection. This molecule’s intended function was to jointwo other RNA molecules (acting as a ribozyme with a functionsimilar to that of the naturally occurring DNA ligase describedin Section 13.3, but for RNA molecules). The process startedwith a large pool of random RNA sequences (1015 different sequences,each about 300 nucleotides long), which were then selectedfor any ligase activity (Figure 24.13). None were very effectiveribozymes for ligase activity, but some were slightlybetter than others. The best of the ribozymes were selected andreverse-transcribed into cDNA (using the enzyme reverse transcriptase).The cDNA molecules were then amplified using thepolymerase chain reaction (PCR; see Figure 13.22).PCR amplification is not perfect, and it introduced many newmutations into the pool of sequences. These sequences werethen transcribed back into RNA molecules using RNA polymerase,and the process was repeated. The ligase activity of theRNAs evolved quickly; after 10 rounds of in vitro evolution, ithad increased by about 7 million times (see Figure 24.13). Similartechniques have since been used to create a wide varietyof molecules with novel enzymatic and binding functions.Molecular evolution is used to study andcombat diseasesMany of the most problematic human diseases are caused byliving, evolving organisms that present a moving target formodern medicine. Recall the example of influenza described atthe start of Chapter 21 and that of HIV described in Chapter 22.The control of these and many other human diseases dependson techniques that can track the evolution of pathogenic organismsthrough time.During the past century, transportation advances have allowedhumans to move around the world with unprecedentedspeed and increasing frequency. Unfortunately, this mobilityhas allowed pathogens to be transmitted among human populationsat much higher rates, which has led to the global emergenceof many “new” diseases. Most of these emerging diseasesare caused by viruses, and virtually all new viral diseases havebeen identified by evolutionary comparison of their genomeswith those of known viruses. In recent years, for example, ro-514 CHAPTER 24 | EVOLUTION OF GENES AND GENOMESStart with arandom poolof RNAsequences.Select the RNAmolecules withthe highestligase activity.Transcribe back intoRNA, and repeat thecycle for 10 rounds.After several rounds,an effective ribozymehas evolved from thepool of random RNAsequences.2Use PCRamplification tointroduce newmutations into theDNA population.4Reversetranscribethe RNAinto DNA.1653Ligation rate (per hour)(effectiveness of ribozyme)0 2 4 6 8 10Round10–610–510–410–310–210–1100101DNA templateRNA population cDNASelected RNApopulation24.13 In Vitro Evolution Starting with a large pool of random RNAsequences, Bartel and Szostak produced a new ribozyme throughrounds of mutation and selection for the ability to ligate RNA sequences.24.4 | WHAT ARE SOME APPLICATIONS OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION? 51524.1 How Are Genomes Used to Study Evolution?SEE WEB ACTIVITY 24.1• The field of molecular evolution concerns relationshipsbetween the structures of genes and proteins and the functionsof organisms.• A genome is an organism’s full set of genes and noncodingDNA.

Studiesof the origins, the timing of emergence, and the global diversityof many human pathogens depend on the principles ofmolecular evolution, as do the efforts to develop and use effectivevaccines against these pathogens. For example, the techniquesto develop polio vaccines, as well as the methods usedto track their effectiveness in human populations, rely on molecularevolutionary approaches.In the future, molecular evolution will become even morecritical to the identification of human (and other) diseases. Oncebiologists have collected data on the genomes of enough organisms,it will be possible to identify an infection by sequencinga portion of the infecting organism’s genome and comparingthis sequence with other sequences on an evolutionary tree. Atpresent, it is difficult to identify many common viral infections(those that cause “colds,” for instance). As genomic databasesand evolutionary trees increase, however, automated methodsof sequencing and rapid phylogenetic comparison of the sequenceswill allow us to identify and treat a much wider arrayof human illnesses.24.4 RECAPMolecular evolutionary studies have provided biologistswith new tools to understand the functions ofmacromolecules and how those functions canchange through time. Molecular evolution is used todevelop synthetic molecules for industrial and pharmaceuticaluses and to identify and combat humandiseases.• Why might a biologist limit a particular investigationto orthologous (as opposed to paralogous) genes?See pp. 512–513• Explain how gene evolution can be used to studyprotein function. See pp. 513–514• Describe the process of in vitro evolution. See p. 514and Figure 24.13Now that we have discussed how organisms and biologicalmolecules evolve, we are ready to consider the evolutionary historyof the Earth. Chapter 25 describes the long-term evolutionarychanges that have given rise to all of life’s diversity.
24.1 How Are Genomes Used to Study Evolution?SEE WEB ACTIVITY 24.1• The field of molecular evolution concerns relationshipsbetween the structures of genes and proteins and the functionsof organisms.• A genome is an organism’s full set of genes and noncodingDNA. In eukaryotes, the genome includes genetic material inthe nucleus of the cell as well as in mitochondria and chloroplasts(where present).• Nucleotide substitutions may or may not result in amino acidreplacements in the encoded proteins.• The estimated number of substitutions between sequences canbe calculated from a similarity matrix using models of sequenceevolution that account for changes that cannot be observeddirectly. Review Figure 24.1, WEB ACTIVITY 24.2• The concept of homology (similarity that results from commonancestry) extends down to the level of particular positions innucleotide or amino acid sequences. Sequence alignmentsfrom different organisms allow us to compare the sequencesand identify homologous positions. Review Figure 24.324.2 What Do Genomes Reveal about EvolutionaryProcesses?• Nonsynonymous substitutions of nucleotides result in aminoacid replacements in proteins, but synonymous substitutionsdo not. Review Figure 24.5• Rates of synonymous substitution are typically higher than ratesof nonsynonymous substitution in protein-coding genes (aresult of stabilizing selection). Review Figure 24.6• Much of the molecular change in nucleotide sequences is aresult of neutral evolution.

24.4 What Are Some Applications of Molecular Evolution?SEE WEB ACTIVITY 24.3• Gene trees describe the evolutionary history of particular genesor gene families.• Orthologs are genes that are related through speciation events,whereas paralogs are genes that are related through geneduplication events. Review Figure 24.12• Protein function can be studied by examining gene evolution.Detection of positive selection can be used to identify molecularchanges that have resulted in functional changes.• In vitro evolution is used to produce synthetic molecules withparticular desired functions. Review Figure 24.13• Many diseases are identified, studied, and combated throughmolecular evolutionary investigations.
