7.1.0	This NASA image is a composite of several satellite-based views of Earth.
7.1.1	To make the whole-Earth image, NASA scientists combine observations of different parts of the planet.
7.1.2	Viewed from space, Earth offers no clues about the diversity of life forms that reside there.
7.1.3	The first forms of life on Earth are thought to have been microorganisms that existed for billions of years in the ocean before plants and animals appeared.
7.1.4	The mammals, birds, and flowers so familiar to us are all relatively recent, originating 130 to 200 million years ago.
7.1.5	Humans have inhabited this planet for only the last 2.5 million years, and only in the last 200,000 years have humans started looking like we do today.

7.1.10	What is biology?
7.1.11	In simple terms, biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments.
7.1.12	This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast.
7.1.13	Biologists may study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic view of a cell to ecosystems and the whole living planet (Figure 1.2).
7.1.14	Listening to the daily news, you will quickly realize how many aspects of biology are discussed every day.
7.1.15	For example, recent news topics include Escherichia coli
7.1.16	(Figure 1.3) outbreaks in spinach and Salmonella contamination in peanut butter.
7.1.17	Other subjects include efforts toward finding a cure for AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer.
7.1.18	On a global scale, many researchers are committed to finding ways to protect the planet, solve environmental issues, and reduce the effects of climate change.
7.1.19	All of these diverse endeavors are related to different facets of the discipline of biology.
7.1.20	Figure 1.3 Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, seen in this scanning electron micrograph, are normal residents of our digestive tracts that aid in the absorption of vitamin K and other nutrients.
7.1.21	However, virulent strains are sometimes responsible for disease outbreaks.

7.1.24	The Process of Science Biology is a science, but what exactly is science?
7.1.25	What does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines?
7.1.26	Science (from the Latin scientia, meaning “knowledge”) can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method.
7.1.27	It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science.
7.1.28	The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation.
7.1.29	The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments.
7.1.30	A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested.
7.1.31	Although using the scientific method is inherent to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is.
7.1.32	This is because it is relatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as physics and chemistry, but when it comes to disciplines like archaeology, psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as it becomes more difficult to repeat experiments.
7.1.33	These areas of study are still sciences, however.
7.1.34	Consider archeology—even though one cannot perform repeatable experiments, hypotheses may still be supported.
7.1.35	For instance, an archeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture existed based on finding a piece of pottery.
7.1.36	Further hypotheses could be made about various characteristics of this culture, and these hypotheses may be found to be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from other findings.
7.1.37	A hypothesis may become a verified theory.
7.1.38	A theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena.
7.1.39	Science may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe.
7.1.40	What would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences?
7.1.41	Frogs?
7.1.42	Plants?
7.1.43	Dinosaur skeletons?
7.1.44	Exhibits about how the brain functions?
7.1.45	A planetarium?
7.1.46	Gems and minerals?
7.1.47	Or, maybe all of the above?
7.1.48	Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy, biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (Figure 1.4).
7.1.49	However, those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered natural sciences.
7.1.50	Thus, a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above.
7.1.51	Figure 1.4
7.1.52	The diversity of scientific fields includes astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and many other fields.
7.1.53	(credit:

7.1.55	There is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include, however.
7.1.56	For some experts, the natural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics.
7.1.57	Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences, which study living things and include biology, and physical sciences, which study nonliving matter and include astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry.
7.1.58	Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary.
7.1.59	Natural sciences are sometimes referred to as “hard science” because they rely on the use of quantitative data; social sciences that study society and human behavior are more likely to use qualitative assessments to drive investigations and findings.
7.1.60	Not surprisingly, the natural science of biology has many branches or subdisciplines.
7.1.61	Cell biologists study cell structure and function, while biologists who study anatomy investigate the structure of an entire organism.
7.1.62	Those biologists studying physiology, however, focus on the internal functioning of an organism.
7.1.63	Some areas of biology focus on only particular types of living things.
7.1.64	For example, botanists explore plants, while zoologists specialize in animals.
7.1.65	Scientific Reasoning One thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal “to know.
7.1.66	”
7.1.67	Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for the development of science.
7.1.68	Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates.
7.1.69	To do this, they use two methods of logical thinking: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.
7.1.70	Inductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion.
7.1.71	This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science.
7.1.72	A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and records them.
7.1.73	These data can be qualitative or quantitative, and the raw data can be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos.
7.1.74	From many observations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence.
7.1.75	Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data.
7.1.76	Brain studies provide an example.
7.1.77	In this type of research, many live brains are observed while people are doing a specific activity, such as viewing images of food.
7.1.78	The part of the brain that “lights up” during this activity is then predicted to be the part controlling the response to the selected stimulus, in this case, images of food.
7.1.79	The “lighting up” of the various areas of the brain is caused by excess absorption of radioactive sugar derivatives by active areas of the brain.
7.1.80	The resultant increase in radioactivity is observed by a scanner.
7.1.81	Then, researchers can stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar responses result.
7.1.82	Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science.
7.1.83	In deductive reason, the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning.
7.1.84	Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results.
7.1.85	From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid.
7.1.86	Studies in climate change can illustrate this type of reasoning.
7.1.87	For example, scientists may predict that if the climate becomes warmer in a particular region, then the distribution of plants and animals should change.
7.1.88	These predictions have been made and tested, and many such changes have been found, such as the modification of arable areas for agriculture, with change based on temperature averages.
7.1.89	Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesisbased science.
7.1.90	Descriptive (or discovery) science, which is usually inductive, aims to observe, explore, and discover, while hypothesis-based science, which is usually deductive, begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested.
7.1.91	The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches.
7.1.92	The fuzzy boundary becomes apparent when thinking about how easily observation can lead to specific questions.
7.1.93	For example, a gentleman in the 1940s observed that the burr seeds that stuck to his clothes and his dog’s fur had a tiny hook structure.
7.1.94	On closer inspection, he discovered that the burrs’ gripping device was more reliable than a zipper.
7.1.95	He eventually developed a company and produced the hook-and-loop fastener popularly known today as Velcro.
7.1.96	Descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.
7.1.97	The Scientific Method Biologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses.
7.1.98	This approach is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method.
7.1.99	The scientific method was used even in ancient times, but it was first documented by England’s Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) (Figure 1.5), who set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry.
7.1.100	The scientific method is not exclusively used by biologists but can be applied to almost all fields of study as a logical, rational problem-solving method.
7.1.101	Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) is credited with being the first to define the scientific method.
7.1.102	(credit: Paul van Somer)
7.1.103	The scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to be solved) that leads to a question.
7.1.104	Let’s think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem.
7.1.105	One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm.
7.1.106	That is an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm.
7.1.107	The student then asks a question:
7.1.108	“Why is the classroom so warm?
7.1.109	” Proposing a Hypothesis Recall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested.
7.1.110	To solve a problem, several hypotheses may be proposed.
7.1.111	For example, one hypothesis might be, “
7.1.112	The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.
7.1.113	”
7.1.114	But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be proposed.
7.1.115	A second hypothesis might be, “
7.1.116	The classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn’t work.
7.1.117	”
7.1.118	Once a hypothesis has been selected, the student can make a prediction.
7.1.119	A prediction is similar to a hypothesis
7.1.120	but it typically has the format “
7.1.121	If . . .
7.1.122	then . . . .
7.1.123	”
7.1.124	For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, “
7.1.125	If the student turns on the air conditioning, then the classroom will no longer be too warm.
7.1.126	”
7.1.127	Testing a Hypothesis A valid hypothesis must be testable.
7.1.128	It should also be falsifiable, meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results.
7.1.129	Importantly, science does not claim to “prove” anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further information.
7.1.130	This step—openness to disproving ideas
7.1.131	—is what distinguishes sciences from nonsciences.
7.1.132	The presence of the supernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable.
7.1.133	To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses.
7.1.134	Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls.
7.1.135	A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment.
7.1.136	The control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized about.
7.1.137	Therefore, if the results of the experimental group differ from the control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized manipulation, rather than some outside factor.
7.1.138	Look for the variables and controls in the examples that follow.
7.1.139	To test the first hypothesis, the student would find out if the air conditioning is on.
7.1.140	If the air conditioning is turned on but does not work, there should be another reason, and this hypothesis should be rejected.
7.1.141	To test the second hypothesis, the student could check if the lights in the classroom are functional.
7.1.142	If so, there is no power failure and this hypothesis should be rejected.
7.1.143	Each hypothesis should be tested by carrying out appropriate experiments.
7.1.144	Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid (Figure 1.6).
7.1.145	Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data are rejected.
7.1.146	While this “warm classroom” example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments might have clearer controls.
7.1.147	For instance, a student might attend class on Monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating on the lecture.
7.1.148	One observation to explain this occurrence might be, “When I eat breakfast before class, I am better able to pay attention.
7.1.149	”
7.1.150	The student could then design an experiment with a control to test this hypothesis.
7.1.151	In hypothesis-based science, specific results are predicted from a general premise.
7.1.152	This type of reasoning is called deductive reasoning: deduction proceeds from the general to the particular.
7.1.153	But the reverse of the process is also possible: sometimes, scientists reach a general conclusion from a number of specific observations.
7.1.154	This type of reasoning is called inductive reasoning, and it proceeds from the particular to the general.
7.1.155	Inductive and deductive reasoning are often used in tandem to advance scientific knowledge (Figure 1.7).
7.1.156	The scientific method may seem too rigid and structured.
7.1.157	It is important to keep in mind that, although scientists often follow this sequence, there is flexibility.
7.1.158	Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach; often, an experiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle.
7.1.159	Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion; instead, scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds.
7.1.160	Scientific reasoning is more complex than the scientific method alone suggests.
7.1.161	Notice, too, that the scientific method can be applied to solving problems that aren’t necessarily scientific in nature.
7.1.162	Two Types of Science: Basic Science and Applied Science
7.1.163	The scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the value of different types of science.
7.1.164	Is it valuable to pursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth if we can apply it to solving a specific problem or to bettering our lives?
7.1.165	This question focuses on the differences between two types of science: basic science and applied science.
7.1.166	Basic science or “pure” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that knowledge.
7.1.167	It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value.
7.1.168	The immediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge’s sake, though this does not mean that, in the end, it may not result in a practical application.
7.1.169	In contrast, applied science or “technology,” aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible, for example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster (Figure 1.8).
7.1.170	In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.
7.1.171	Figure 1.8
7.1.172	After Hurricane Ike struck the Gulf Coast in 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rescued this brown pelican.
7.1.173	Thanks to applied science, scientists knew how to rehabilitate the bird.
7.1.174	(credit: FEMA)
7.1.175	Some individuals may perceive applied science as “useful” and basic science as “useless.
7.1.176	”
7.1.177	A question these people might pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, “What for?
7.1.178	”
7.1.179	A careful look at the history of science, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value.
7.1.180	Many scientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on the results generated through basic science.
7.1.181	Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems.
7.1.182	Both approaches are valid.
7.1.183	It is true that there are problems that demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of the wide knowledge foundation generated through basic science.
7.1.184	One example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication.
7.1.185	Strands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life.
7.1.186	During DNA replication, DNA makes new copies of itself, shortly before a cell divides.
7.1.187	Understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to identify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity.
7.1.188	Without basic science, it is unlikely that applied science would exist.
7.1.189	Another example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which each human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the exact location of each gene.
7.1.190	(The gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individual’s complete collection of genes is his or her genome.)
7.1.191	Other less complex organisms have also been studied as part of this project in order to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes.
7.1.192	The Human Genome Project (Figure 1.9) relied on basic research carried out with simple organisms and, later, with the human genome.
7.1.193	An important end goal eventually became using the data for applied research, seeking cures and early diagnoses for genetically related diseases.
7.1.194	Figure 1.9
7.1.195	The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several different fields of science.
7.1.196	The project, which sequenced the entire human genome, was completed in 2003.
7.1.197	(credit: the U.S. Department of Energy Genome Programs (http://genomics.energy.gov))
7.1.198	While research efforts in both basic science and applied science are usually carefully planned, it is important to note that some discoveries are made by serendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise.
7.1.199	Penicillin was discovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria open.
7.1.200	An unwanted mold grew on the dish, killing the bacteria.
7.1.201	The mold turned out to be Penicillium, and a new antibiotic was discovered.
7.1.202	Even in the highly organized world of science, luck—when combined with an observant, curious mind—can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.
7.1.203	Reporting Scientific Work
7.1.204	Whether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other researchers to expand and build upon their discoveries.
7.1.205	Collaboration with other scientists—when planning, conducting, and analyzing results—are all important for scientific research.
7.1.206	For this reason, important aspects of a scientist’s work are communicating with peers and disseminating results to peers.
7.1.207	Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the select few who are present.
7.1.208	Instead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals.
7.1.209	Peer-reviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientist’s colleagues, or peers.
7.1.210	These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge whether or not the scientist’s work is suitable for publication.
7.1.211	The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough.
7.1.212	Grant proposals, which are requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review.
7.1.213	Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings.
7.1.214	The experimental results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists.
7.1.215	A scientific paper is very different from creative writing.
7.1.216	Although creativity is required to design experiments, there are fixed guidelines when it comes to presenting scientific results.
7.1.217	First, scientific writing must be brief, concise, and accurate.
7.1.218	A scientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments.
7.1.219	The scientific paper consists of several specific sections—introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion.
7.1.220	This structure is sometimes called the “IMRaD” format.
7.1.221	There are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an abstract (a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper.
7.1.222	There might be additional sections depending on the type of paper and the journal where it will be published; for example, some review papers require an outline.
7.1.223	The introduction starts with brief, but broad, background information about what is known in the field.
7.1.224	A good introduction also gives the rationale of the work; it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper, where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented.
7.1.225	The introduction refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal.
7.1.226	Using the work or ideas of others without proper citation is considered plagiarism.
7.1.227	The materials and methods section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances used, and the method and techniques used by the researchers to gather data.
7.1.228	The description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to repeat the experiment and obtain similar results, but it does not have to be verbose.
7.1.229	This section will also include information on how measurements were made and what types of calculations and statistical analyses were used to examine raw data.
7.1.230	Although the materials and methods section gives an accurate description of the experiments, it does not discuss them.
7.1.231	Some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section, but it is more common to combine both.
7.1.232	If the journal does not allow the combination of both sections, the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation.
7.1.233	The results are presented by means of tables or graphs, but no duplicate information should be presented.
7.1.234	In the discussion section, the researcher will interpret the results, describe how variables may be related, and attempt to explain the observations.
7.1.235	It is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific research.
7.1.236	Therefore, proper citations are included in this section as well.
7.1.237	Finally, the conclusion section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings.
7.1.238	While the scientific paper almost certainly answered one or more scientific questions that were stated, any good research should lead to more questions.
7.1.239	Therefore, a well-done scientific paper leaves doors open for the researcher and others to continue and expand on the findings.
7.1.240	Review articles do not follow the IMRAD format because they do not present original scientific findings, or primary literature; instead, they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature and typically include extensive reference sections.response, but it is not always easy to define life.
7.1.241	For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others.
7.1.242	It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life.
7.1.243	Consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly speaking.
7.1.244	Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life; since the events that preceded life are not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term.
7.1.245	From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are the shared properties that make something “alive”?
7.1.246	And once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure?
7.1.247	And, finally, when faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them?
7.1.248	As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.
7.1.249	Properties of Life
7.1.250	All living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution.
7.1.251	When viewed together, these nine characteristics serve to define life.
7.1.252	Organisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells.
7.1.253	Even very simple, single-celled organisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms make up molecules; these in turn make up cell organelles and other cellular inclusions.
7.1.254	In multicellular organisms (Figure 1.10), similar cells form tissues.
7.1.255	Tissues, in turn, collaborate to create organs (body structures with a distinct function).
7.1.256	Organs work together to form organ systems.
7.1.257	Figure 1.11
7.1.258	The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched.
7.1.259	After a few minutes, the plant returns to normal.
7.1.260	(credit:
7.1.261	Alex Lomas) Organisms respond to diverse stimuli.
7.1.262	For example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or respond to touch (Figure 1.11).
7.1.263	Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called chemotaxis) or light (phototaxis).
7.1.264	Movement toward a stimulus is considered a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus is considered a negative response.
7.1.265	Reproduction Single-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide to form two new cells.
7.1.266	Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline cells that will form new individuals.
7.1.267	When reproduction occurs, genes containing DNA are passed along to an organism’s offspring.
7.1.268	These genes ensure that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape.
7.1.269	Growth and Development Organisms grow and develop following specific instructions coded for by their genes.
7.1.270	These genes provide instructions that will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species’ young (Figure 1.12) will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents.

7.1.274	Two examples of internal functions regulated in an organism are nutrient transport and blood flow.
7.1.275	Organs (groups of tissues working together) perform specific functions, such as carrying oxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.
7.1.276	Figure 1.13 Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and other mammals living in ice-covered regions maintain their body temperature by generating heat and reducing heat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin.

7.1.279	In order to function properly, cells need to have appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and appropriate concentration of diverse chemicals.
7.1.280	These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next.
7.1.281	Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through homeostasis (literally, “steady state”)—the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions.
7.1.282	For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation.
7.1.283	Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 1.13), have body structures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat.
7.1.284	Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur, feathers, blubber, and fat.

7.1.289	All organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities.
7.1.290	Some organisms capture energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy in food; others use chemical energy in molecules they take in as food (Figure 1.14).
7.1.291	Levels of Organization of Living Things Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to large.
7.1.292	The atom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter.
7.1.293	It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons.
7.1.294	Atoms form molecules.
7.1.295	A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds.
7.1.296	Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules, large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than macromolecules).
7.1.297	An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
7.1.298	(Figure 1.15), which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms.
7.1.299	Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called organelles.
7.1.300	Organelles are small structures that exist within cells.
7.1.301	Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable functions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars.
7.1.302	All living things are made of cells; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms.
7.1.303	(This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells.
7.1.304	To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce.)
7.1.305	Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular.
7.1.306	Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic.
7.1.307	Prokaryotes are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membranebound nuclei; in contrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus.
7.1.308	In larger organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions.
7.1.309	Organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function.
7.1.310	Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants.
7.1.311	An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs.
7.1.312	Mammals have many organ systems.
7.1.313	For instance, the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels.
7.1.314	Organisms are individual living entities.
7.1.315	For example, each tree in a forest is an organism.
7.1.316	Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as microorganisms.
7.1.317	All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a population.
7.1.318	For example, a forest may include many pine trees.
7.1.319	All of these pine trees represent the population of pine trees in this forest.
7.1.320	Different populations may live in the same specific area.
7.1.321	For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations.
7.1.322	A community is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area.
7.1.323	For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forest’s community.
7.1.324	The forest itself is an ecosystem.
7.1.325	An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, non-living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water.
7.1.326	At the highest level of organization (Figure 1.16), the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on earth.
7.1.327	It includes land, water, and even the atmosphere to a certain extent.
7.1.328	The biological levels of organization of living things are shown.
7.1.329	From a single organelle to the entire biosphere, living organisms are parts of a highly structured hierarchy.

7.1.344	modification of work by The fact that biology, as a science, has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth.
7.1.345	The source of this diversity is evolution, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species.
7.1.346	Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems.
7.1.347	The evolution of various life forms on Earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1.17).
7.1.348	A phylogenetic tree is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both.
7.1.349	A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches.
7.1.350	The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new species.
7.1.351	The length of each branch is proportional to the time elapsed since the split.
7.1.352	This phylogenetic tree was constructed by microbiologist Carl Woese using data obtained from sequencing ribosomal RNA genes.
7.1.353	The tree shows the separation of living organisms into three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
7.1.354	Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotes, single-celled organisms lacking intracellular organelles.
7.1.355	(credit: Eric Gaba; NASA Astrobiology Institute)Carl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree
7.1.356	In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria.
7.1.357	The organizational scheme was based mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which are used by modern systematics.
7.1.358	The pioneering work of American microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
7.1.359	The first two are prokaryotic cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles.
7.1.360	The third domain contains the eukaryotes and includes unicellular microorganisms together with the four original kingdoms (excluding bacteria).
7.1.361	Woese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (Figure 1.17).
7.1.362	Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles.
7.1.363	To construct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape).
7.1.364	Woese’s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes that are universally distributed, present in every organism, and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution).
7.1.365	Woese’s approach was revolutionary because comparisons of physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability (Figure 1.18).
7.1.366	The comparison of homologous DNA and RNA sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified the separation of the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.
7.1.367	These images represent different domains.
7.1.368	The (a) bacteria in this micrograph belong to Domain Bacteria, while the (b) extremophiles (not visible) living in this hot vent belong to Domain Archaea.
7.1.369	Both the (c) sunflower and (d) lion are part of Domain Eukarya.

7.1.372	The scope of biology is broad and therefore contains many branches and subdisciplines.
7.1.373	Biologists may pursue one of those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field.
7.1.374	For instance, molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the way they are regulated.
7.1.375	Microbiology, the study of microorganisms, is the study of the structure and function of single-celled organisms.
7.1.376	It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists, ecologists, and geneticists, among others.
7.1.377	Forensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law.
7.1.378	Biologists as well as chemists and biochemists can be forensic scientists.
7.1.379	Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves examining trace materials associated with crimes.
7.1.380	Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job.
7.1.381	Also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do.
7.1.382	Their job activities are primarily related to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault.
7.1.383	Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing DNA (Figure 1.19) found in many different environments and materials.
7.1.384	Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains.
7.1.385	Students who want to pursue careers in forensic science will most likely be required to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math courses.
7.1.386	Another field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is considered a branch of biology, it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience.
7.1.387	Because of its interdisciplinary nature, this subdiscipline studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular, cellular, developmental, medical, and computational approaches.
7.1.388	Paleontology, another branch of biology, uses fossils to study life’s history (Figure 1.20).
7.1.389	Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants, respectively.
7.1.390	Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or physiologists, to name just a few areas.
7.1.391	This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue.
7.1.392	Biology is the culmination of the achievements of the natural sciences from their inception to today.
7.1.393	Excitingly, it is the cradle of emerging sciences, such as the biology of brain activity, genetic engineering of custom organisms, and the biology of evolution that uses the laboratory tools of molecular biology to retrace the earliest stages of life on earth.
7.1.394	A scan of news headlines—whether reporting on immunizations, a newly discovered species, sports doping, or a genetically-modified food—demonstrates the way biology is active in and important to our everyday world.  
7.2.0	Atoms are the building blocks of molecules found in the universe—air, soil, water, rocks . . .
7.2.1	and also the cells of all living organisms.
7.2.2	In this model of an organic molecule, the atoms of carbon (black), hydrogen (white), nitrogen (blue), oxygen (red), and sulfur (yellow) are shown in proportional atomic size.
7.2.3	The silver rods indicate chemical bonds.
7.2.4	Elements in various combinations comprise all matter, including living things.
7.2.5	Some of the most abundant elements in living organisms include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus.
7.2.6	These form the nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids that are the fundamental components of living matter.
7.2.7	Biologists must understand these important building blocks and the unique structures of the atoms that make up molecules, allowing for the formation of cells, tissues, organ systems, and entire organisms.
7.2.8	All biological processes follow the laws of physics and chemistry, so in order to understand how biological systems work, it is important to understand the underlying physics and chemistry.
7.2.9	For example, the flow of blood within the circulatory system follows the laws of physics that regulate the modes of fluid flow.
7.2.10	The breakdown of the large, complex molecules of food into smaller molecules—and the conversion of these to release energy to be stored in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—is a series of chemical reactions that follow chemical laws.
7.2.11	The properties of water and the formation of hydrogen bonds are key to understanding living processes.
7.2.12	Recognizing the properties of acids and bases is important, for example, to our understanding of the digestive process.
7.2.13	Therefore, the fundamentals of physics and chemistry are important for gaining insight into biological processes.
7.2.14	At its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter.
7.2.15	Matter is any substance that occupies space and has mass.
7.2.16	Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that cannot be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions.
7.2.17	There are 118 elements, but only 92 occur naturally.
7.2.18	The remaining elements are synthesized in laboratories and are unstable.
7.2.19	Each element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is already “taken” by another element, a combination of two letters.
7.2.20	Some elements follow the English term for the element, such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium.
7.2.21	Other elements’ chemical symbols derive from their Latin names; for example, the symbol for sodium is Na, referring to natrium, the Latin word for sodium.
7.2.22	The four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N).
7.2.23	In the nonliving world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to living organisms are relatively rare on the earth as a whole, as shown in Table 2.1.
7.2.24	For example, the atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains little carbon and hydrogen, while the earth’s crust, although it contains oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen, has little nitrogen and carbon.
7.2.25	In spite of their differences in abundance, all elements and the chemical reactions between them obey the same chemical and physical laws regardless of whether they are a part of the living or non-living world.
7.2.26	To understand how elements come together, we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element, the atom.
7.2.27	An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element.
7.2.28	For example, one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature.
7.2.29	A gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and containing small amounts of other elements known as impurities.
7.2.30	Gold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold.
7.2.31	An atom is composed of two regions: the nucleus, which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons, and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, as illustrated in Figure 2.2.
7.2.32	Atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles.
7.2.33	The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons.
7.2.34	Elements, such as helium, depicted here, are made up of atoms.
7.2.35	Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.
7.2.36	Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 Å~ 10-24 grams.
7.2.37	Scientists arbitrarily define this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, as shown in Table 2.2.
7.2.38	Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge.
7.2.39	A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged.
7.2.40	Therefore, the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge.
7.2.41	Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons, weighing only 9.11 Å~ 10-28 grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit.
7.2.42	Hence, they do not contribute much to an element’s overall atomic mass.
7.2.43	Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the atom’s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone.
7.2.44	Although not significant contributors to mass, electrons do contribute greatly to the atom’s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton.
7.2.45	In uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus.
7.2.46	In these atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net charge.
7.2.47	Accounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the volume of an atom—greater than 99 percent—is, in fact, empty space.
7.2.48	With all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another.
7.2.49	The reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each other.
7.2.50	Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons.
7.2.51	The number of protons determines an element’s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another.
7.2.52	The number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess.
7.2.53	Together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element’s mass number, as illustrated in Figure 2.3.
7.2.54	Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number.
7.2.55	This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number.
7.2.56	Since an element’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the atomic mass, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes.
7.2.57	Often, the resulting number contains a fraction.
7.2.58	For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons).
7.2.59	Isotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.
7.2.60	Some elements—such as carbon, potassium, and uranium—have naturally occurring isotopes.
7.2.61	Carbon-12 contains six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons; therefore, it has a mass number of 12 (six protons and six neutrons).
7.2.62	Carbon-14 contains six protons, eight neutrons, and six electrons; its atomic mass is 14 (six protons and eight neutrons).
7.2.63	These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes.
7.2.64	Some isotopes may emit neutrons, protons, and electrons, and attain a more stable atomic configuration (lower level of potential energy); these are radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes.
7.2.65	Radioactive decay (carbon-14 losing neutrons to eventually become carbon-12) describes the energy loss that occurs when an unstable atom’s nucleus releases radiation.
7.2.66	Carbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and methane.
7.2.67	Carbon-14 (14C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from atmospheric 14N (nitrogen) by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays.
7.2.68	This is a continuous process, so more 14C is always being created.
7.2.69	As a living organism incorporates 14C initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis, the relative amount of 14C in its body is equal to the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere.
7.2.70	When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting 14C, so the ratio between 14C and 12C will decline as 14C decays gradually to 14N by a process called beta decay—the emission of electrons or positrons.
7.2.71	This decay gives off energy in a slow process.
7.2.72	After approximately 5,730 years, half of the starting concentration of 14C will have been converted back to 14N.
7.2.73	The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable form is called its half-life.
7.2.74	Because the half-life of 14C is long, it is used to date formerly living objects such as old bones or wood.
7.2.75	Comparing the ratio of the 14C concentration found in an object to the amount of 14C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined.
7.2.76	On the basis of this amount, the age of the material, such as the pygmy mammoth shown in Figure 2.4, can be calculated with accuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years.
7.2.77	Other elements have isotopes with different half lives.
7.2.78	For example, 40K (potassium-40) has a half-life of 1.25 billion years, and 235U (Uranium 235) has a half-life of about 700 million years.
7.2.79	Through the use of radiometric dating, scientists can study the age of fossils or other remains of extinct organisms to understand how organisms have evolved from earlier species.
7.2.80	The age of carbon-containing remains less than about 50,000 years old, such as this pygmy mammoth, can be determined using carbon dating.
7.2.81	The different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table.
7.2.82	Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) in 1869, the table groups elements that, although unique, share certain chemical properties with other elements.
7.2.83	The properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids, or liquids.
7.2.84	Elements also have specific chemical reactivity, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other.
7.2.85	In the periodic table, shown in Figure 2.5, the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number and are arranged in a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties.
7.2.86	In addition to providing the atomic number for each element, the periodic table also displays the element’s atomic mass.
7.2.87	Looking at carbon, for example, its symbol (C) and name appear, as well as its atomic number of six (in the upper left-hand corner) and its atomic mass of 12.11.
7.2.88	The periodic table shows the atomic mass and atomic number of each element.
7.2.89	The atomic number appears above the symbol for the element and the approximate atomic mass appears below it.
7.2.90	The periodic table groups elements according to chemical properties.
7.2.91	The differences in chemical reactivity between the elements are based on the number and spatial distribution of an atom’s electrons.
7.2.92	Atoms that chemically react and bond to each other form molecules.
7.2.93	Molecules are simply two or more atoms chemically bonded together.
7.2.94	Logically, when two atoms chemically bond to form a molecule, their electrons, which form the outermost region of each atom, come together first as the atoms form a chemical bond.
7.2.95	It should be stressed that there is a connection between the number of protons in an element, the atomic number that distinguishes one element from another, and the number of electrons it has.
7.2.96	In all electrically neutral atoms, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons.
7.2.97	Thus, each element, at least when electrically neutral, has a characteristic number of electrons equal to its atomic number.
7.2.98	An early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr (1885–1962).
7.2.99	The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from the nucleus, as illustrated in Figure 2.6.
7.2.100	These orbits form electron shells or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells.
7.2.101	These energy levels are designated by a number and the symbol
7.2.102	“
7.2.103	n.”
7.2.104	For example, 1n represents the first energy level located closest to the nucleus.
7.2.105	The Bohr model was developed by Niels Bohrs in 1913.
7.2.106	In this model, electrons exist within principal shells.
7.2.107	An electron normally exists in the lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus.
7.2.108	Energy from a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy shell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays back to the ground state.
7.2.109	In the process, a photon of light is released.
7.2.110	Electrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals of increasing energy further from the nucleus.
7.2.111	If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they will be filled with one electron in each energy level before a second electron is added.
7.2.112	The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the energetic stability of the atom and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.
7.2.113	Under standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost shell.
7.2.114	The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons.
7.2.115	This is known as the octet rule, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell, the outermost electron shell.
7.2.116	Examples of some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in Figure 2.7.
7.2.117	Notice that in this Figure 2.7, helium has a complete outer electron shell, with two electrons filling its first and only shell.
7.2.118	Similarly, neon has a complete outer 2n shell containing eight electrons.
7.2.119	In contrast, chlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells, respectively, but theoretically they would be more energetically stable if they followed the octet rule and had eight.
7.2.120	Bohr diagrams indicate how many electrons fill each principal shell.
7.2.121	Group 18 elements (helium, neon, and argon are shown) have a full outer, or valence, shell.
7.2.122	A full valence shell is the most stable electron configuration.
7.2.123	Elements in other groups have partially filled valence shells and gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration.
7.2.124	An atom may give, take, or share electrons with another atom to achieve a full valence shell, the most stable electron configuration.
7.2.125	Looking at this figure, how many electrons do elements in group 1 need to lose in order to achieve a stable electron configuration?
7.2.126	How many electrons do elements in groups 14 and 17 need to gain to achieve a stable configuration?
7.2.127	Understanding that the organization of the periodic table is based on the total number of protons (and electrons) helps us know how electrons are distributed among the outer shell.
7.2.128	The periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based on the number of electrons and where these electrons are located.
7.2.129	Take a closer look at the some of the elements in the table’s far right column in Figure 2.5.
7.2.130	The group 18 atoms helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) all have filled outer electron shells, making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability; they are highly stable as single atoms.
7.2.131	Their non-reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases (or noble gases).
7.2.132	Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left-hand column.
7.2.133	These elements, including hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na), all have one electron in their outermost shells.
7.2.134	That means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water.
7.2.135	Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable.
7.2.136	As a result of losing a negatively charged electron, they become positively charged ions.
7.2.137	Group 17 elements, including fluorine and chlorine, have seven electrons in their outmost shells, so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules, making them negatively charged ions.
7.2.138	Group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most important to living systems, have four electrons in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with other atoms.
7.2.139	Thus, the columns of the periodic table represent the potential shared state of these elements’ outer electron shells that is responsible for their similar chemical characteristics.
7.2.140	Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model of the atom does not accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus.
7.2.141	They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun, but are found in electron orbitals.
7.2.142	These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles, but also like waves.
7.2.143	Mathematical equations from quantum mechanics known as wave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time.
7.2.144	The area where an electron is most likely to be found is called its orbital.
7.2.145	Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom’s electron shell configuration.
7.2.146	Within each electron shell are subshells, and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons.
7.2.147	While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path.
7.2.148	Subshells are designated by the letter s, p, d, and f.
7.2.149	The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital.
7.2.150	Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital, which can hold two electrons.
7.2.151	Principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons.
7.2.152	The p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals, as illustrated in Figure 2.8.
7.2.153	Subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively.
7.2.154	These are not shown in the illustration.
7.2.155	Principal shell 3n has s, p, and d subshells and can hold 18 electrons.
7.2.156	Principal shell 4n has s, p, d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons.
7.2.157	Moving away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy levels increases.
7.2.158	Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table, the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital.
7.2.159	The s subshells are shaped like spheres.
7.2.160	Both the 1n and 2n principal shells have an s orbital, but the size of the sphere is larger in the 2n orbital.
7.2.161	Each sphere is a single orbital.
7.2.162	p subshells are made up of three dumbbellshaped orbitals.
7.2.163	Principal shell 2n has a p subshell, but shell 1 does not.
7.2.164	The closest orbital to the nucleus, called the 1s orbital, can hold up to two electrons.
7.2.165	This orbital is equivalent to the innermost electron shell of the Bohr model of the atom.
7.2.166	It is called the 1s orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus.
7.2.167	The 1s orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital can be filled.
7.2.168	Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot within the 1s orbital occupied.
7.2.169	This is designated as 1s1, where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1s orbital.
7.2.170	Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the 1s orbital with its two electrons.
7.2.171	This is designated as 1s2, referring to the two electrons of helium in the 1s orbital.
7.2.172	On the periodic table Figure 2.5, hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row (period); this is because they only have electrons in their first shell, the 1s orbital.
7.2.173	Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the 1s and no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state.
7.2.174	The second electron shell may contain eight electrons.
7.2.175	This shell contains another spherical s orbital and three “
7.2.176	dumbbell” shaped p orbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, as shown in Figure 2.8.
7.2.177	After the 1s orbital is filled, the second electron shell is filled, first filling its 2s orbital and then its three p orbitals.
7.2.178	When filling the p orbitals, each takes a single electron; once each p orbital has an electron, a second may be added.
7.2.179	Lithium (Li) contains three electrons that occupy the first and second shells.
7.2.180	Two electrons fill the 1s orbital, and the third electron then fills the 2s orbital.
7.2.181	Its electron configuration is 1s22s1.
7.2.182	Neon (Ne), on the other hand, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its innermost 1s orbital and eight fill its second shell (two each in the 2s and three p orbitals); thus, it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms.
7.2.183	Larger elements have additional orbitals, making up the third electron shell.
7.2.184	While the concepts of electron shells and orbitals are closely related, orbitals provide a more accurate depiction of the electron configuration of an atom because the orbital model specifies the different shapes and special orientations of all the places that electrons may occupy.
7.2.185	All elements are most stable when their outermost shell is filled with electrons according to the octet rule.
7.2.186	This is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable.
7.2.187	However, since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration.
7.2.188	When two or more atoms chemically bond with each other, the resultant chemical structure is a molecule.
7.2.189	The familiar water molecule, H2O, consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom; these bond together to form water, as illustrated in Figure 2.9.
7.2.190	Atoms can form molecules by donating, accepting, or sharing electrons to fill their outer shells.
7.2.191	Two or more atoms may bond with each other to form a molecule.
7.2.192	When two hydrogens and an oxygen share electrons via covalent bonds, a water molecule is formed.
7.2.193	Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart.
7.2.194	The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants (usually found on the left side of a chemical equation), and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products (usually found on the right side of a chemical equation).
7.2.195	An arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the direction of the chemical reaction; this direction is not always a “one-way street.
7.2.196	”
7.2.197	For the creation of the water molecule shown above, the chemical equation would be: An example of a simple chemical reaction is the breaking down of hydrogen peroxide molecules, each of which consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to two oxygen atoms (H2O2).
7.2.198	The reactant hydrogen peroxide is broken down into water, containing one oxygen atom bound to two hydrogen atoms (H2O), and oxygen, which consists of two bonded oxygen atoms (O2).
7.2.199	In the equation below, the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules.
7.2.200	This is an example of a balanced chemical equation, wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the equation.
7.2.201	According to the law of conservation of matter, the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal, such that no atoms are, under normal circumstances, created or destroyed.
7.2.202	Even though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules (each atom remains bonded to at least one other atom), in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds: they contain atoms of more than one type of element.
7.2.203	Molecular oxygen, on the other hand, as shown in Figure 2.10,consists of two doubly bonded oxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a mononuclear molecule.
7.2.204	The oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule are joined by a double bond.
7.2.205	Some chemical reactions, such as the one shown above, can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up.
7.2.206	The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible.
7.2.207	Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction.
7.2.208	In reversible reactions, reactants are turned into products, but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold (characteristic of the particular reaction), some of these products will be converted back into reactants; at this point, the designations of products and reactants are reversed.
7.2.209	This back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and products occurs—a state called equilibrium.
7.2.210	These situations of reversible reactions are often denoted by a chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactants and products.
7.2.211	For example, in human blood, excess hydrogen ions (H+) bind to bicarbonate ions (HCO3 -) forming an equilibrium state with carbonic acid (H2CO3).
7.2.212	If carbonic acid were added to this system, some of it would be converted to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions.
7.2.213	In biological reactions, however, equilibrium is rarely obtained because the concentrations of the reactants or products or both are constantly changing, often with a product of one reaction being a reactant for another.
7.2.214	To return to the example of excess hydrogen ions in the blood, the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction.
7.2.215	However, the carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of being converted back to bicarbonate ion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the chemical law known as law of mass action.
7.2.216	These reactions are important for maintaining the homeostasis of our blood.
7.2.217	Some atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions.
7.2.218	This fills their outermost electron shell and makes them energetically more stable.
7.2.219	Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge.
7.2.220	Cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons.
7.2.221	Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions.
7.2.222	Anions are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in “
7.2.223	-ide”: the anion of chlorine is called chloride, and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide, for example.
7.2.224	This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer.
7.2.225	As Figure 2.11 illustrates, sodium
7.2.226	(Na) only has one electron in its outer electron shell.
7.2.227	It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell.
7.2.228	If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11 neutrons, and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1.
7.2.229	It is now referred to as a sodium ion.
7.2.230	Chlorine (Cl) in its lowest energy state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell.
7.2.231	Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven.
7.2.232	Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons, 17 neutrons, and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (–1) charge.
7.2.233	It is now referred to as a chloride ion.
7.2.234	In this example, sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell.
7.2.235	Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells.
7.2.236	Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium cation) or –1 (chloride anion) charge.
7.2.237	Note that these transactions can normally only take place simultaneously: in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom.
7.2.238	In the formation of an ionic compound, metals lose electrons and nonmetals gain electrons to achieve an octet.
7.2.239	Ionic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges.
7.2.240	For instance, positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride, or table salt, creating a crystalline molecule with zero net charge.
7.2.241	Certain salts are referred to in physiology as electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), ions necessary for nerve impulse conduction, muscle contractions and water balance.
7.2.242	Many sports drinks and dietary supplements provide these ions to replace those lost from the body via sweating during exercise.
7.2.243	Another way the octet rule can be satisfied is by the sharing of electrons between atoms to form covalent bonds.
7.2.244	These bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms.
7.2.245	Covalent bonds are commonly found in carbon-based organic molecules, such as our DNA and proteins.
7.2.246	Covalent bonds are also found in inorganic molecules like H2O, CO2, and O2.
7.2.247	One, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared, making single, double, and triple bonds, respectively.
7.2.248	The more covalent bonds between two atoms, the stronger their connection.
7.2.249	Thus, triple bonds are the strongest.
7.2.250	The strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in acquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules, even though molecular nitrogen, N2, is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere.
7.2.251	Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and, as with all molecules, the sharing of these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron shells, making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms.
7.2.252	This strong triple bond makes it difficult for living systems to break apart this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and DNA.
7.2.253	The formation of water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding.
7.2.254	The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds, as shown in Figure 2.9.
7.2.255	The electron from the hydrogen splits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms.
7.2.256	To completely fill the outer shell of oxygen, which has six electrons in its outer shell but which would be more stable with eight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) are needed:
7.2.257	hence the well-known formula H2O.
7.2.258	The electrons are shared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each, making both elements more stable.
7.2.259	There are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar.
7.2.260	In a polar covalent bond, shown in Figure 2.12, the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other.
7.2.261	Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements, a slightly positive (δ+) or slightly negative (δ–) charge develops.
7.2.262	This partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics.
7.2.263	Water is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge.
7.2.264	This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen’s electrons.
7.2.265	Thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges, respectively.
7.2.266	Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus.
7.2.267	Either way, the atom’s relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other, and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges.
7.2.268	(Hydrogen bonds, which are discussed in detail below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules.)
7.2.269	Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar bonds are often present in organic molecules.
7.2.270	Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally.
7.2.271	For example, molecular oxygen (O2) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms.
7.2.272	Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is methane (CH4), also shown in Figure 2.12.
7.2.273	Carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it.
7.2.274	It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making a stable outer shell of eight electrons.
7.2.275	Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar; thus, nonpolar bonds form.
7.2.276	The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two electrons.
7.2.277	These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent molecule.
7.2.278	Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape.
7.2.279	Both water and carbon dioxide have polar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel each other out.
7.2.280	Ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break.
7.2.281	Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which determines their behavior in biological systems.
7.2.282	However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds.
7.2.283	Weaker bonds can also form between molecules.
7.2.284	Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.
7.2.285	Without these two types of bonds, life as we know it would not exist.
7.2.286	Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, lifesustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.
7.2.287	When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because hydrogen’s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen.
7.2.288	Because the hydrogen is slightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges.
7.2.289	When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the δ+of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ– charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually oxygen or nitrogen, or within the same molecule.
7.2.290	This interaction is called a hydrogen bond.
7.2.291	This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules.
7.2.292	Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers, creating a major force in combination.
7.2.293	Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix.
7.2.294	Like hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules.
7.2.295	Van der Waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities, which are not always symmetrical around an atom.
7.2.296	For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to one another.
7.2.297	These bonds—along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds—contribute to the three-dimensional structure of the proteins in our cells that is necessary for their proper function.
7.2.298	Pharmaceutical chemists are responsible for the development of new drugs and trying to determine the mode of action of both old and new drugs.
7.2.299	They are involved in every step of the drug development process.
7.2.300	Drugs can be found in the natural environment or can be synthesized in the laboratory.
7.2.301	In many cases, potential drugs found in nature are changed chemically in the laboratory to make them safer and more effective, and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version found in nature.
7.2.302	After the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug, the chemist then develops the drug, perhaps chemically altering it, testing it to see if the drug is toxic, and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production.
7.2.303	Then, the process of getting the drug approved for human use begins.
7.2.304	In the United States, drug approval is handled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and involves a series of large-scale experiments using human subjects to make sure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition it aims to treat.
7.2.305	This process often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists, in addition to chemists, to complete testing and gain approval.
7.2.306	An example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is Paclitaxel (Taxol), an anti-cancer drug used to treat breast cancer.
7.2.307	This drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree.
7.2.308	Another example is aspirin, originally isolated from willow tree bark.
7.2.309	Finding drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants, fungi, and other forms of life to see if any biologically active compounds are found within them.
7.2.310	Sometimes, traditional medicine can give modern medicine clues to where an active compound can be found.
7.2.311	For example, the use of willow bark to make medicine has been known for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt.
7.2.312	It was not until the late 1800s, however, that the aspirin molecule, known as acetylsalicylic acid, was purified and marketed for human use.
7.2.313	Occasionally, drugs developed for one use are found to have unforeseen effects that allow these drugs to be used in other, unrelated ways.
7.2.314	For example, the drug minoxidil (Rogaine) was originally developed to treat high blood pressure.
7.2.315	When tested on humans, it was noticed that individuals taking the drug would grow new hair.
7.2.316	Eventually the drug was marketed to men and women with baldness to restore lost hair.
7.2.317	The career of the pharmaceutical chemist may involve detective work, experimentation, and drug development, all with the goal of making human beings healthier.
7.2.318	Why do scientists spend time looking for water on other planets?
7.2.319	Why is water so important?
7.2.320	It is because water is essential to life as we know it.
7.2.321	Water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life on Earth.
7.2.322	Approximately 60–70 percent of the human body is made up of water.
7.2.323	Without it, life as we know it simply would not exist.
7.2.324	The polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special properties that are intimately tied to the processes of life.
7.2.325	Life originally evolved in a watery environment, and most of an organism’s cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cell’s cytoplasm.
7.2.326	Special properties of water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, its ability to dissolve polar molecules, its cohesive and adhesive properties, and its dissociation into ions that leads to the generation of pH. Understanding these characteristics of water helps to elucidate its importance in maintaining life.
7.2.327	One of water’s important properties is that it is composed of polar molecules: the hydrogen and oxygen within water molecules (H2O) form polar covalent bonds.
7.2.328	While there is no net charge to a water molecule, the polarity of water creates a slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to water’s properties of attraction.
7.2.329	Water’s charges are generated because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, making it more likely that a shared electron would be found near the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus, thus generating the partial negative charge near the oxygen.
7.2.330	As a result of water’s polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between water molecules, forming hydrogen bonds.
7.2.331	Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions.
7.2.332	A polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic (hydro-
7.2.333	= “water”; -philic =
7.2.334	“loving
7.2.335	”).
7.2.336	In contrast, non-polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water, as shown in Figure 2.13 and separate from it rather than dissolve in it, as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar (an acidic water solution).
7.2.337	These nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic (hydro- = “water”; -phobic =
7.2.338	“fearing”).
7.2.339	The formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it.
7.2.340	As water molecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other liquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life.
7.2.341	In liquid water, hydrogen bonds are constantly formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other.
7.2.342	The breaking of these bonds is caused by the motion (kinetic energy) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system.
7.2.343	When the heat is raised as water is boiled, the higher kinetic energy of the water molecules causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape into the air as gas (steam or water vapor).
7.2.344	On the other hand, when the temperature of water is reduced and water freezes, the water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that makes ice less dense than liquid water, a phenomenon not seen in the solidification of other liquids.
7.2.345	Oil and water do not mix.
7.2.346	As this macro image of oil and water shows, oil does not dissolve in water but forms droplets instead.
7.2.347	This is due to it being a nonpolar compound.

7.2.349	The formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it.
7.2.350	As water molecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other liquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life.
7.2.351	In liquid water, hydrogen bonds are constantly formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other.
7.2.352	The breaking of these bonds is caused by the motion (kinetic energy) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system.
7.2.353	When the heat is raised as water is boiled, the higher kinetic energy of the water molecules causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape into the air as gas (steam or water vapor).
7.2.354	On the other hand, when the temperature of water is reduced and water freezes, the water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that makes ice less dense than liquid water, a phenomenon not seen in the solidification of other liquids.
7.2.355	Water’s lower density in its solid form is due to the way hydrogen bonds are oriented as it freezes: the water molecules are pushed farther apart compared to liquid water.
7.2.356	With most other liquids, solidification when the temperature drops includes the lowering of kinetic energy between molecules, allowing them to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and giving the solid a greater density than the liquid.
7.2.357	The lower density of ice, illustrated and pictured in Figure 2.14, an anomaly, causes it to float at the surface of liquid water, such as in an iceberg or in the ice cubes in a glass of ice water.
7.2.358	In lakes and ponds, ice will form on the surface of the water creating an insulating barrier that protects the animals and plant life in the pond from freezing.
7.2.359	Without this layer of insulating ice, plants and animals living in the pond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive.
7.2.360	The detrimental effect of freezing on living organisms is caused by the expansion of ice relative to liquid water.
7.2.361	The ice crystals that form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes essential for the function of living cells, irreversibly damaging them.
7.2.362	Cells can only survive freezing if the water in them is temporarily replaced by another liquid like glycerol.
7.2.363	Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water.
7.2.364	The (a) lattice structure of ice makes it less dense than the freely flowing molecules of liquid water, enabling it to (b) float on water.
7.2.365	Water’s high heat capacity is a property caused by hydrogen bonding among water molecules.
7.2.366	Water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquids.
7.2.367	Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius.
7.2.368	For water, this amount is one calorie.
7.2.369	It therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool.
7.2.370	In fact, the specific heat capacity of water is about five times more than that of sand.
7.2.371	This explains why the land cools faster than the sea.
7.2.372	Due to its high heat capacity, water is used by warm blooded animals to more evenly disperse heat in their bodies: it acts in a similar manner to a car’s cooling system, transporting heat from warm places to cool places, causing the body to maintain a more even temperature.
7.2.373	Water also has a high heat of vaporization, the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas.
7.2.374	A considerable amount of heat energy (586 cal) is required to accomplish this change in water.
7.2.375	This process occurs on the surface of water.
7.2.376	As liquid water heats up, hydrogen bonding makes it difficult to separate the liquid water molecules from each other, which is required for it to enter its gaseous phase (steam).
7.2.377	As a result, water acts as a heat sink or heat reservoir and requires much more heat to boil than does a liquid such as ethanol (grain alcohol), whose hydrogen bonding with other ethanol molecules is weaker than water’s hydrogen bonding.
7.2.378	Eventually, as water reaches its boiling point of 100Åã Celsius (212Åã Fahrenheit), the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules, and the kinetic energy (motion) between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas.
7.2.379	Even when below its boiling point, water’s individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and vaporize: this process is known as evaporation.
7.2.380	The fact that hydrogen bonds need to be broken for water to evaporate means that a substantial amount of energy is used in the process.
7.2.381	As the water evaporates, energy is taken up by the process, cooling the environment where the evaporation is taking place.
7.2.382	In many living organisms, including in humans, the evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows the organism to cool so that homeostasis of body temperature can be maintained.
7.2.383	Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it.
7.2.384	Therefore, water is referred to as a solvent, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds.
7.2.385	The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle with water molecules.
7.2.386	This is referred to as a sphere of hydration, or a hydration shell, as illustrated in Figure 2.15 and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water.
7.2.387	When ionic compounds are added to water, the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation.
7.2.388	Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions.
7.2.389	Consider table salt (NaCl, or sodium chloride): when NaCl crystals are added to water, the molecules of NaCl dissociate into Na+ and Cl– ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, illustrated in Figure 2.15.
7.2.390	The positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative charge of the water molecule’s oxygen.
7.2.391	The negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the partially positive charge of the hydrogen on the water molecule.
7.2.392	Have you ever filled a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops?
7.2.393	Before it overflows, the water forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass.
7.2.394	This water can stay above the glass because of the property of cohesion.
7.2.395	In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together at the liquid-gas (water-air) interface, although there is no more room in the glass.
7.2.396	Cohesion allows for the development of surface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress.
7.2.397	This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity.
7.2.398	When a small scrap of paper is placed onto the droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet even though paper is denser (heavier) than the water.
7.2.399	Cohesion and surface tension keep the hydrogen bonds of water molecules intact and support the item floating on the top.
7.2.400	It’s even possible to “float” a needle on top of a glass of water if it is placed gently without breaking the surface tension, as shown in Figure 2.16.
7.2.401	These cohesive forces are related to water’s property of adhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules.
7.2.402	This attraction is sometimes stronger than water’s cohesive forces, especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes.
7.2.403	Adhesion is observed when water “climbs” up the tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the tube than in the middle.
7.2.404	This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it.
7.2.405	This type of adhesion is called capillary action, and is illustrated in Figure 2.17.
7.2.406	The weight of the needle is pulling the surface downward; at the same time, the surface tension is pulling it up, suspending it on the surface of the water and keeping it from sinking.
7.2.407	Notice the indentation in the water around the needle.
7.2.408	These cohesive forces are related to water’s property of adhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules.
7.2.409	This attraction is sometimes stronger than water’s cohesive forces, especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes.
7.2.410	Adhesion is observed when water “climbs” up the tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the tube than in the middle.
7.2.411	This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it.
7.2.412	This type of adhesion is called capillary action, and is illustrated in Figure 2.17.
7.2.413	Capillary action in a glass tube is caused by the adhesive forces exerted by the internal surface of the glass exceeding the cohesive forces between the water molecules themselves.  
7.2.414	Why are cohesive and adhesive forces important for life?
7.2.415	Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for the transport of water from the roots to the leaves in plants.
7.2.416	These forces create a “pull” on the water column.
7.2.417	This pull results from the tendency of water molecules being evaporated on the surface of the plant to stay connected to water molecules below them, and so they are pulled along.
7.2.418	Plants use this natural phenomenon to help transport water from their roots to their leaves.
7.2.419	Without these properties of water, plants would be unable to receive the water and the dissolved minerals they require.
7.2.420	In another example, insects such as the water strider, shown in Figure 2.18, use the surface tension of water to stay afloat on the surface layer of water and even mate there.
7.2.421	The pH of a solution indicates its acidity or alkalinity.
7.2.422	litmus or pH paper, filter paper that has been treated with a natural water-soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator, to test how much acid (acidity) or base (alkalinity) exists in a solution.
7.2.423	You might have even used some to test whether the water in a swimming pool is properly treated.
7.2.424	In both cases, the pH test measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in a given solution.
7.2.425	Hydrogen ions are spontaneously generated in pure water by the dissociation (ionization) of a small percentage of water molecules into equal numbers of hydrogen (H+) ions and hydroxide (OH-) ions.
7.2.426	While the hydroxide ions are kept in solution by their hydrogen bonding with other water molecules, the hydrogen ions, consisting of naked protons, are immediately attracted to un-ionized water molecules, forming hydronium ions (H30+).
7.2.427	Still, by convention, scientists refer to hydrogen ions and their concentration as if they were free in this state in liquid water.
7.2.428	The concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1 Å~
7.2.429	10-7 moles H+ ions per liter of water.
7.2.430	Moles (mol) are a way to express the amount of a substance (which can be atoms, molecules, ions, etc), with one mole being equal to 6.02 x 1023 particles of the substance.
7.2.431	Therefore, 1 mole of water is equal to 6.02 x 1023 water molecules.
7.2.432	The pH is calculated as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration.
7.2.433	The log10 of 1 Å~ 10-7 is -7.0, and the negative of this number (indicated by the “p” of “pH”) yields a pH of 7.0, which is also known as neutral pH.
7.2.434	The pH inside of human cells and blood are examples of two areas of the body where near-neutral pH is maintained.
7.2.435	Non-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water.
7.2.436	Using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers, high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH. An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution, usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate.
7.2.437	A base provides either hydroxide ions (OH–) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH.
7.2.438	In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions, these ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules.
7.2.439	The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H+.
7.2.440	For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) completely dissociates into hydrogen and chloride ions and is highly acidic, whereas the acids in tomato juice or vinegar do not completely dissociate and are considered weak acids.
7.2.441	Conversely, strong bases are those substances that readily donate OH– or take up hydrogen ions.
7.2.442	Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and many household cleaners are highly alkaline and give up OH– rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the pH.
7.2.443	An example of a weak basic solution is seawater, which has a pH near 8.0, close enough to neutral pH that marine organisms adapted to this saline environment are able to thrive in it.
7.2.444	The pH scale is, as previously mentioned, an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 (Figure 2.19).
7.2.445	Anything below 7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline.
7.2.446	Extremes in pH in either direction from 7.0 are usually considered inhospitable to life.
7.2.447	The pH inside cells (6.8) and the pH in the blood (7.4) are both very close to neutral.
7.2.448	However, the environment in the stomach is highly acidic, with a pH of 1 to 2.
7.2.449	So how do the cells of the stomach survive in such an acidic environment?
7.2.450	How do they homeostatically maintain the near neutral pH inside them?
7.2.451	The answer is that they cannot do it and are constantly dying.
7.2.452	New stomach cells are constantly produced to replace dead ones, which are digested by the stomach acids.
7.2.453	It is estimated that the lining of the human stomach is completely replaced every seven to ten days.
7.2.454	The pH scale measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution.
7.2.455	So how can organisms whose bodies require a near-neutral pH ingest acidic and basic substances (a human drinking orange juice, for example) and survive?
7.2.456	Buffers are the key.
7.2.457	Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH–, keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival.
7.2.458	Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person’s well-being.
7.2.459	The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid (H2CO3), bicarbonate ion (HCO3 –), and carbon dioxide (CO2).
7.2.460	When bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid, hydrogen ions are removed, moderating pH changes.
7.2.461	Similarly, as shown in Figure 2.20, excess carbonic acid can be converted to carbon dioxide gas and exhaled through the lungs.
7.2.462	This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the blood’s pH. Likewise, if too much OH– is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will combine with it to create bicarbonate, lowering the pH. Without this buffer system, the body’s pH would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy.
7.2.463	This diagram shows the body’s buffering of blood pH levels.
7.2.464	The blue arrows show the process of raising pH as more CO2 is made.
7.2.465	The purple arrows indicate the reverse process: the lowering of pH as more bicarbonate is created.
7.2.466	Other examples of buffers are antacids used to combat excess stomach acid.
7.2.467	Many of these over-the-counter medications work in the same way as blood buffers, usually with at least one ion capable of absorbing hydrogen and moderating pH, bringing relief to those that suffer
7.2.468	“heartburn” after eating.
7.2.469	The unique properties of water that contribute to this capacity to balance pH—as well as water’s other characteristics—are essential to sustaining life on Earth.
7.2.470	Cells are made of many complex molecules called macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), carbohydrates, and lipids.
7.2.471	The macromolecules are a subset of organic molecules (any carbon-containing liquid, solid, or gas) that are especially important for life.
7.2.472	The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon.
7.2.473	The carbon atom has unique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms, making this versatile element ideal to serve as the basic structural component, or “backbone,” of the macromolecules.
7.2.474	Individual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell.
7.2.475	With an atomic number of 6 (six electrons and six protons), the first two electrons fill the inner shell, leaving four in the second shell.
7.2.476	Therefore, carbon atoms can form up to four covalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule.
7.2.477	The methane molecule provides an example: it has the chemical formula CH4.
7.2.478	Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a pair of electrons.
7.2.479	This results in a filled outermost shell.
7.2.480	Hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (CH4) described above.
7.2.481	We often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels—like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter.
7.2.482	The many covalent bonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount of energy, which is released when these molecules are burned (oxidized).
7.2.483	Methane, an excellent fuel, is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, with a central carbon atom bonded to four different hydrogen atoms, as illustrated in Figure 2.21.
7.2.484	The geometry of the methane molecule, where the atoms reside in three dimensions, is determined by the shape of its electron orbitals.
7.2.485	The carbons and the four hydrogen atoms form a shape known as a tetrahedron, with four triangular faces; for this reason, methane is described as having tetrahedral geometry.
7.2.486	Methane has a tetrahedral geometry, with each of the four hydrogen atoms spaced 109.5Åã apart.
7.2.487	As the backbone of the large molecules of living things, hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains, carbon rings, or combinations of both.
7.2.488	Furthermore, individual carbon-to-carbon bonds may be single, double, or triple covalent bonds, and each type of bond affects the geometry of the molecule in a specific way.
7.2.489	This three-dimensional shape or conformation of the large molecules of life (macromolecules) is critical to how they function.
7.2.490	Hydrocarbon chains are formed by successive bonds between carbon atoms and may be branched or unbranched.
7.2.491	Furthermore, the overall geometry of the molecule is altered by the different geometries of single, double, and triple covalent bonds, illustrated in Figure 2.22.
7.2.492	The hydrocarbons ethane, ethene, and ethyne serve as examples of how different carbon-to-carbon bonds affect the geometry of the molecule.
7.2.493	The names of all three molecules start with the prefix “
7.2.494	eth-,
7.2.495	” which is the prefix for two carbon hydrocarbons.
7.2.496	The suffixes “-ane,” “-ene,” and “
7.2.497	-yne
7.2.498	” refer to the presence of single, double, or triple carbon-carbon bonds, respectively.
7.2.499	Thus, propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecules, butane, butane, and butyne for four carbon molecules, and so on.
7.2.500	Double and triple bonds change the geometry of the molecule: single bonds allow rotation along the axis of the bond, whereas double bonds lead to a planar configuration and triple bonds to a linear one.
7.2.501	These geometries have a significant impact on the shape a particular molecule can assume.
7.2.502	When carbon forms single bonds with other atoms, the shape is tetrahedral.
7.2.503	When two carbon atoms form a double bond, the shape is planar, or flat.
7.2.504	Single bonds, like those found in ethane, are able to rotate.
7.2.505	Double bonds, like those found in ethene cannot rotate, so the atoms on either side are locked in place.
7.2.506	So far, the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons, which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms.
7.2.507	Another type of hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbons, consists of closed rings of carbon atoms.
7.2.508	Ring structures are found in hydrocarbons, sometimes with the presence of double bonds, which can be seen by comparing the structure of cyclohexane to benzene in Figure 2.23.
7.2.509	Examples of biological molecules that incorporate the benzene ring include some amino acids and cholesterol and its derivatives, including the hormones estrogen and testosterone.
7.2.510	The benzene ring is also found in the herbicide 2,4-D. Benzene is a natural component of crude oil and has been classified as a carcinogen.
7.2.511	Some hydrocarbons have both aliphatic and aromatic portions; beta-carotene is an example of such a hydrocarbon.
7.2.512	Carbon can form five-and six membered rings.
7.2.513	Single or double bonds may connect the carbons in the ring, and nitrogen may be substituted for carbon.
7.2.514	The three-dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry.
7.2.515	Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement (structure) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers.
7.2.516	Structural isomers (like butane and isobutene shown in Figure 2.24a) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds: both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens (C4H10), but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties.
7.2.517	For example, due to their different chemical properties, butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches, whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans.
7.2.518	Geometric isomers, on the other hand, have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms, especially in carbon-to-carbon double bonds.
7.2.519	In the simple molecule butene (C4H8), the two methyl groups (CH3) can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule, as illustrated in Figure 2.24b.
7.2.520	When the carbons are bound on the same side of the double bond, this is the cis configuration; if they are on opposite sides of the double bond, it is a trans configuration.
7.2.521	In the trans configuration, the carbons form a more or less linear structure, whereas the carbons in the cis configuration make a bend (change in direction) of the carbon backbone.
7.2.522	In triglycerides (fats and oils), long carbon chains known as fatty acids may contain double bonds, which can be in either the cis or trans configuration, illustrated in Figure 2.25.
7.2.523	Fats with at least one double bond between carbon atoms are unsaturated fats.
7.2.524	When some of these bonds are in the cis configuration, the resulting bend in the carbon backbone of the chain means that triglyceride molecules cannot pack tightly, so they remain liquid (oil) at room temperature.
7.2.525	On the other hand, triglycerides with trans double bonds (popularly called trans fats), have relatively linear fatty acids that are able to pack tightly together at room temperature and form solid fats.
7.2.526	In the human diet, trans fats are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, so many food manufacturers have reduced or eliminated their use in recent years.
7.2.527	In contrast to unsaturated fats, triglycerides without double bonds between carbon atoms are called saturated fats, meaning that they contain all the hydrogen atoms available.
7.2.528	Saturated fats are a solid at room temperature and usually of animal origin.
7.2.529	These space-filling models show a cis (oleic acid) and a trans (eliadic acid) fatty acid.
7.2.530	Notice the bend in the molecule cause by the cis configuration.
7.2.531	Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three-dimensional placement of atoms so that they are mirror images.
7.2.532	As shown in Figure 2.26, an amino acid alanine example, the two structures are non-superimposable.
7.2.533	In nature, only the L-forms of amino acids are used to make proteins.
7.2.534	Some D forms of amino acids are seen in the cell walls of bacteria, but never in their proteins.
7.2.535	Similarly, the D-form of glucose is the main product of photosynthesis and the L-form of the molecule is rarely seen in nature.
7.2.536	D-alanine and L-alanine are examples of enantiomers or mirror images.
7.2.537	Only the L-forms of amino acids are used to make proteins.
7.2.538	Functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules.
7.2.539	They are found along the “carbon backbone” of macromolecules.
7.2.540	This carbon backbone is formed by chains and/or rings of carbon atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen.
7.2.541	Molecules with other elements in their carbon backbone are substituted hydrocarbons.
7.2.542	The functional groups in a macromolecule are usually attached to the carbon backbone at one or several different places along its chain and/or ring structure.
7.2.543	Each of the four types of macromolecules—proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids—has its own characteristic set of functional groups that contributes greatly to its differing chemical properties and its function in living organisms.
7.2.544	A functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions.
7.2.545	Some of the important functional groups in biological molecules are shown in Figure 2.27; they include: hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl.
7.2.546	These groups play an important role in the formation of molecules like DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids.
7.2.547	Functional groups are usually classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics.
7.2.548	An example of a hydrophobic group is the non-polar methane molecule.
7.2.549	Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group found in amino acids, some amino acid side chains, and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids.
7.2.550	This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (H+) from the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO- group; this contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever molecule it is found on.
7.2.551	Other functional groups, such as the carbonyl group, have a partially negatively charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, again making the molecule more hydrophilic.
7.2.552	The functional groups shown here are found in many different biological molecules.
7.2.553	Hydrogen bonds between functional groups (within the same molecule or between different molecules) are important to the function of many macromolecules and help them to fold properly into and maintain the appropriate shape for functioning.
7.2.554	Hydrogen bonds are also involved in various recognition processes, such as DNA complementary base pairing and the binding of an enzyme to its substrate, as illustrated in Figure 2.28.
7.2.555	Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass.
7.2.556	It is made up of elements.
7.2.557	All of the 92 elements that occur naturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various ways to create molecules, which in turn combine to form cells, tissues, organ systems, and organisms.
7.2.558	Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest units of an element that retain all of the properties of that element.
7.2.559	Electrons can be transferred, shared, or cause charge disparities between atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals interactions.
7.2.560	Water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life.
7.2.561	It is a polar molecule, allowing for the formation of hydrogen bonds.
7.2.562	Hydrogen bonds allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water.
7.2.563	Therefore, water is an excellent solvent.
7.2.564	The hydrogen bonds between water molecules cause the water to have a high heat capacity, meaning it takes a lot of added heat to raise its temperature.
7.2.565	As the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water continually break and form anew.
7.2.566	This allows for the overall temperature to remain stable, although energy is added to the system.
7.2.567	Water also exhibits a high heat of vaporization, which is key to how organisms cool themselves by the evaporation of sweat.
7.2.568	Water’s cohesive forces allow for the property of surface tension, whereas its adhesive properties are seen as water rises inside capillary tubes.
7.2.569	The pH value is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution and is one of many chemical characteristics that is highly regulated in living organisms through homeostasis.
7.2.570	Acids and bases can change pH values, but buffers tend to moderate the changes they cause.
7.2.571	These properties of water are intimately connected to the biochemical and physical processes performed by living organisms, and life would be very different if these properties were altered, if it could exist at all.
7.2.572	The unique properties of carbon make it a central part of biological molecules.
7.2.573	Carbon binds to oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen covalently to form the many molecules important for cellular function.
7.2.574	Carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell and can form four bonds.
7.2.575	Carbon and hydrogen can form hydrocarbon chains or rings.
7.2.576	Functional groups are groups of atoms that confer specific properties to hydrocarbon (or substituted hydrocarbon) chains or rings that define their overall chemical characteristics and function.
7.3.0	Food provides the body with the nutrients it needs to survive.
7.3.1	Many of these critical nutrients are biological macromolecules, or large molecules, necessary for life.
7.3.2	These macromolecules (polymers) are built from different combinations of smaller organic molecules (monomers).
7.3.3	What specific types of biological macromolecules do living things require?
7.3.4	How are these molecules formed?
7.3.5	What functions do they serve?
7.3.6	In this chapter, these questions will be explored.
7.3.7	As you’ve learned, biological macromolecules are large molecules, necessary for life, that are built from smaller organic molecules.
7.3.8	There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids); each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions.
7.3.9	Combined, these molecules make up the majority of a cell’s dry mass (recall that water makes up the majority of its complete mass).
7.3.10	Biological macromolecules are organic, meaning they contain carbon.
7.3.11	In addition, they may contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor elements.  
7.3.12	Most macromolecules are made from single subunits, or building blocks, called monomers.
7.3.13	The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers.
7.3.14	In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts.
7.3.15	This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while losing water.
7.3.16	”  
7.3.17	In a dehydration synthesis reaction (Figure 3.2), the hydrogen of one monomer combines with the hydroxyl group of another monomer, releasing a molecule of water.
7.3.18	At the same time, the monomers share electrons and form covalent bonds.
7.3.19	As additional monomers join, this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer.
7.3.20	Different types of monomers can combine in many configurations, giving rise to a diverse group of macromolecules.
7.3.21	Even one kind of monomer can combine in a variety of ways to form several different polymers: for example, glucose monomers are the constituents of starch, glycogen, and cellulose.  
7.3.22	Polymers are broken down into monomers in a process known as hydrolysis, which means “to split water,” a reaction in which a water molecule is used during the breakdown (Figure 3.3).
7.3.23	During these reactions, the polymer is broken into two components: one part gains a hydrogen atom (H+) and the other gains a hydroxyl molecule (OH–) from a split water molecule.  
7.3.24	Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed, or “sped up,” by specific enzymes; dehydration reactions involve the formation of new bonds, requiring energy, while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy.
7.3.25	These reactions are similar for most macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class.
7.3.26	For example, in our bodies, food is hydrolyzed, or broken down, into smaller molecules by catalytic enzymes in the digestive system.
7.3.27	This allows for easy absorption of nutrients by cells in the intestine.
7.3.28	Each macromolecule is broken down by a specific enzyme.
7.3.29	For instance, carbohydrates are broken down by amylase, sucrase, lactase, or maltase.
7.3.30	Proteins are broken down by the enzymes pepsin and peptidase, and by hydrochloric acid.
7.3.31	Lipids are broken down by lipases.
7.3.32	Breakdown of these macromolecules provides energy for cellular activities.  
7.3.33	Most people are familiar with carbohydrates, one type of macromolecule, especially when it comes to what we eat.
7.3.34	To lose weight, some individuals adhere to “low-carb” diets.
7.3.35	Athletes, in contrast, often “carb-load” before important competitions to ensure that they have enough energy to compete at a high level.
7.3.36	Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our diet; grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates.
7.3.37	Carbohydrates provide energy to the body, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar that is a component of starch and an ingredient in many staple foods.
7.3.38	Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans, animals, and plants.  
7.3.39	Carbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula (CH2O)n, where n is the number of carbons in the molecule.
7.3.40	In other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules.
7.3.41	This formula also explains the origin of the term
7.3.42	“carbohydrate”:
7.3.43	the components are carbon (“carbo”) and the components of water (hence, “hydrate”).
7.3.44	Carbohydrates are classified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.  
7.3.45	Monosaccharides (mono-
7.3.46	= “one”; sacchar- =
7.3.47	“sweet”) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose.
7.3.48	In monosaccharides, the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven.
7.3.49	Most monosaccharide names end with the suffix -ose.
7.3.50	If the sugar has an aldehyde group (the functional group with the structure R-CHO), it is known as an aldose, and if it has a ketone group (the functional group with the structure RC(=O)R'), it is known as a ketose.
7.3.51	Depending on the number of carbons in the sugar, they also may be known as trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and or hexoses (six carbons).
7.3.52	See Figure 3.4 for an illustration of the monosaccharides.  
7.3.53	The chemical formula for glucose is C6H12O6.
7.3.54	In humans, glucose is an important source of energy.
7.3.55	During cellular respiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
7.3.56	Plants synthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water, and glucose in turn is used for energy requirements for the plant.
7.3.57	Excess glucose is often stored as starch that is catabolized (the breakdown of larger molecules by cells) by humans and other animals that feed on plants.  
7.3.58	Galactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in sucrose, in fruit) are other common monosaccharides.
7.3.59	Although glucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (C6H12O6), they differ structurally and chemically (and are known as isomers) because of the different arrangement of functional groups around the asymmetric carbon; all of these monosaccharides have more than one asymmetric carbon (Figure 3.5).  
7.3.60	Monosaccharides can exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules; in aqueous solutions they are usually found in ring forms (Figure 3.6).
7.3.61	Glucose in a ring form can have two different arrangements of the hydroxyl group (OH) around the anomeric carbon (carbon 1 that becomes asymmetric in the process of ring formation).
7.3.62	If the hydroxyl group is below carbon number 1 in the sugar, it is said to be in the alpha (α) position, and if it is above the plane, it is said to be in the beta (β) position.  
7.3.63	Disaccharides (di- =
7.3.64	“two”) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (also known as a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis).
7.3.65	During this process, the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combines with the hydrogen of another monosaccharide, releasing a molecule of water and forming a covalent bond.
7.3.66	A covalent bond formed between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule (in this case, between two monosaccharides) is known as a glycosidic bond (Figure 3.7).
7.3.67	Glycosidic bonds (also called glycosidic linkages) can be of the alpha or the beta type.  
7.3.68	Common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose (Figure 3.8).
7.3.69	Lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the monomers glucose and galactose.
7.3.70	It is found naturally in milk.
7.3.71	Maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed by a dehydration reaction between two glucose molecules.
7.3.72	The most common disaccharide is sucrose, or table sugar, which is composed of the monomers glucose and fructose.  
7.3.73	A long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide (poly-
7.3.74	= “many”).
7.3.75	The chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides.
7.3.76	The molecular weight may be 100,000 daltons or more depending on the number of monomers joined.
7.3.77	Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are primary examples of polysaccharides.  
7.3.78	Starch is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of a mixture of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose).
7.3.79	Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose, beyond the plant’s immediate energy needs, is stored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds.
7.3.80	The starch in the seeds provides food for the embryo as it germinates and can also act as a source of food for humans and animals.
7.3.81	The starch that is consumed by humans is broken down by enzymes, such as salivary amylases, into smaller molecules, such as maltose and glucose.
7.3.82	The cells can then absorb the glucose.  
7.3.83	Starch is made up of glucose monomers that are joined by α 1-4 or α 1-6 glycosidic bonds.
7.3.84	The numbers 1-4 and 1-6 refer to the carbon number of the two residues that have joined to form the bond.
7.3.85	As illustrated in Figure 3.9, amylose is starch formed by unbranched chains of glucose monomers (only α 1-4 linkages), whereas amylopectin is a branched polysaccharide (α 1-6 linkages at the branch points).  
7.3.86	Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is made up of monomers of glucose.
7.3.87	Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells.
7.3.88	Whenever blood glucose levels decrease, glycogen is broken down to release glucose in a process known as glycogenolysis.  
7.3.89	Cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer.
7.3.90	The cell wall of plants is mostly made of cellulose; this provides structural support to the cell.
7.3.91	Wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature.
7.3.92	Cellulose is made up of glucose monomers that are linked by β 1-4 glycosidic bonds (Figure 3.10).  
7.3.93	As shown in Figure 3.10, every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over, and the monomers are packed tightly as extended long chains.
7.3.94	This gives cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strength—which is so important to plant cells.
7.3.95	While the β 1-4 linkage cannot be broken down by human digestive enzymes, herbivores such as cows, koalas, buffalos, and horses are able, with the help of the specialized flora in their stomach, to digest plant material that is rich in cellulose and use it as a food source.
7.3.96	In these animals, certain species of bacteria and protists reside in the rumen (part of the digestive system of herbivores) and secrete the enzyme cellulase.
7.3.97	The appendix of grazing animals also contains bacteria that digest cellulose, giving it an important role in the digestive systems of ruminants.
7.3.98	Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that can be used as an energy source by the animal.
7.3.99	Termites are also able to break down cellulose because of the presence of other organisms in their bodies that secrete cellulases.  
7.3.100	Carbohydrates serve various functions in different animals.
7.3.101	Arthropods (insects, crustaceans, and others) have an outer skeleton, called the exoskeleton, which protects their internal body parts (as seen in the bee in Figure 3.11).
7.3.102	This exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin, which is a polysaccharide-containing nitrogen.
7.3.103	It is made of repeating units of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine, a modified sugar.
7.3.104	Chitin is also a major component of fungal cell walls; fungi are neither animals nor plants and form a kingdom of their own in the domain Eukarya.  
7.3.105	Are carbohydrates good for you?
7.3.106	People who wish to lose weight are often told that carbohydrates are bad for them and should be avoided.
7.3.107	Some diets completely forbid carbohydrate consumption, claiming that a low-carbohydrate diet helps people to lose weight faster.
7.3.108	However, carbohydrates have been an important part of the human diet for thousands of years; artifacts from ancient civilizations show the presence of wheat, rice, and corn in our ancestors’ storage areas.  
7.3.109	Carbohydrates should be supplemented with proteins, vitamins, and fats to be parts of a well-balanced diet.
7.3.110	Calorie-wise, a gram of carbohydrate provides 4.3 Kcal.
7.3.111	For comparison, fats provide 9 Kcal/g, a less desirable ratio.
7.3.112	Carbohydrates contain soluble and insoluble elements; the insoluble part is known as fiber, which is mostly cellulose.
7.3.113	Fiber has many uses; it promotes regular bowel movement by adding bulk, and it regulates the rate of consumption of blood glucose.
7.3.114	Fiber also helps to remove excess cholesterol from the body: fiber binds to the cholesterol in the small intestine, then attaches to the cholesterol and prevents the cholesterol particles from entering the bloodstream, and then cholesterol exits the body via the feces.
7.3.115	Fiber-rich diets also have a protective role in reducing the occurrence of colon cancer.
7.3.116	In addition, a meal containing whole grains and vegetables gives a feeling of fullness.
7.3.117	As an immediate source of energy, glucose is broken down during the process of cellular respiration, which produces ATP, the energy currency of the cell.
7.3.118	Without the consumption of carbohydrates, the availability of “instant energy” would be reduced.
7.3.119	Eliminating carbohydrates from the diet is not the best way to lose weight.
7.3.120	A low-calorie diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean meat, together with plenty of exercise and plenty of water, is the more sensible way to lose weight.  
7.3.121	Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature.
7.3.122	This is because they are hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carbon–carbon or carbon–hydrogen bonds.
7.3.123	Non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (“water fearing”), or insoluble in water.
7.3.124	Lipids perform many different functions in a cell.
7.3.125	Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of fats.
7.3.126	Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (Figure 3.12).
7.3.127	For example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry when forming a protective layer over fur or feathers because of their water- repellant hydrophobic nature.
7.3.128	Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of all cellular membranes.
7.3.129	Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.  
7.3.130	A fat molecule consists of two main components—glycerol and fatty acids.
7.3.131	Glycerol is an organic compound (alcohol) with three carbons, five hydrogens, and three hydroxyl (OH) groups.
7.3.132	Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which a carboxyl group is attached, hence the name “
7.3.133	fatty acid.
7.3.134	”
7.3.135	The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36; most common are those containing 12–18 carbons.
7.3.136	In a fat molecule, the fatty acids are attached to each of the three carbons of the glycerol molecule with an ester bond through an oxygen atom (Figure 3.13).
7.3.137	During this ester bond formation, three water molecules are released.
7.3.138	The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar.
7.3.139	Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure.
7.3.140	Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin.
7.3.141	For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree.
7.3.142	Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts.  
7.3.143	Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated.
7.3.144	In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated.
7.3.145	Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized.
7.3.146	Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid (Figure 3.14)  Most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are called oils.
7.3.147	If there is one double bond in the molecule, then it is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then it is known as a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).  
7.3.148	When a fatty acid has no double bonds, it is known as a saturated fatty acid because no more hydrogen may be added to the carbon atoms of the chain.
7.3.149	A fat may contain similar or different fatty acids attached to glycerol.
7.3.150	Long straight fatty acids with single bonds tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature.
7.3.151	Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic acid
7.3.152	(common in meat) and the fat with butyric acid (common in butter) are examples of saturated fats.
7.3.153	Mammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell’s volume.
7.3.154	In plants, fat or oil is stored in many seeds and is used as a source of energy during seedling development.
7.3.155	Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain cis unsaturated fatty acids.
7.3.156	Cis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond.
7.3.157	If hydrogens are present in the same plane, it is referred to as a cis fat; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes, it is referred to as a trans fat.
7.3.158	The cis double bond causes a bend or a “kink
7.3.159	” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature (Figure 3.16).
7.3.160	Olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats.
7.3.161	Unsaturated fats help to lower blood cholesterol levels whereas saturated fats contribute to plaque formation in the arteries.  
7.3.162	In the food industry, oils are artificially hydrogenated to make them semi-solid and of a consistency desirable for many processed food products.
7.3.163	Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them.
7.3.164	During this hydrogenation process, double bonds of the cis- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double bonds in the trans- conformation.  
7.3.165	Margarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans fats.
7.3.166	Recent studies have shown that an increase in trans fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease.
7.3.167	Many fast food restaurants have recently banned the use of trans fats, and food labels are required to display the trans fat content.  
7.3.168	Essential fatty acids are fatty acids required but not synthesized by the human body.
7.3.169	Consequently, they have to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet.
7.3.170	Omega-3 fatty acids (like that shown in Figure 3.17) fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans
7.3.171	(the other being omega-6 fatty acid).
7.3.172	These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are called omega-3 because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon by a double bond.  
7.3.173	The farthest carbon away from the carboxyl group is numbered as the omega (ω) carbon, and if the double bond is between the third and fourth carbon from that end, it is known as an omega-3 fatty acid.
7.3.174	Nutritionally important because the body does not make them, omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all of which are polyunsaturated.
7.3.175	Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
7.3.176	Research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attacks, reduce triglycerides in the blood, lower blood pressure, and prevent thrombosis by inhibiting blood clotting.
7.3.177	They also reduce inflammation, and may help reduce the risk of some cancers in animals.  
7.3.178	Like carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity.
7.3.179	It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other “fatty” foods leads to weight gain.
7.3.180	However, fats do have important functions.
7.3.181	Many vitamins are fat soluble, and fats serve as a long-term storage form of fatty acids: a source of energy.
7.3.182	They also provide insulation for the body.
7.3.183	Therefore, “healthy” fats in moderate amounts should be consumed on a regular basis.  
7.3.184	Wax covers the feathers of some aquatic birds and the leaf surfaces of some plants.
7.3.185	Because of the hydrophobic nature of waxes, they prevent water from sticking on the surface (Figure 3.18).
7.3.186	Waxes are made up of long fatty acid chains esterified to long-chain alcohols.  
7.3.187	Phospholipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane, the outermost layer of animal cells.
7.3.188	Like fats, they are composed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone.
7.3.189	Instead of three fatty acids attached as in triglycerides, however, there are two fatty acids forming diacylglycerol, and the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is  occupied by a modified phosphate group (Figure 3.19).
7.3.190	A phosphate group alone attached to a diaglycerol does not qualify as a phospholipid; it is phosphatidate (diacylglycerol 3-phosphate), the precursor of phospholipids.
7.3.191	The phosphate group is modified by an alcohol.
7.3.192	Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine are two important phospholipids that are found in plasma membranes.  
7.3.193	A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part.
7.3.194	The fatty acid chains are hydrophobic and cannot interact with water, whereas the phosphate-containing group is hydrophilic and interacts with water  
7.3.195	The head is the hydrophilic part, and the tail contains the hydrophobic fatty acids.
7.3.196	In a membrane, a bilayer of phospholipids forms the matrix of the structure, the fatty acid tails of phospholipids face inside, away from water, whereas the phosphate group faces the outside, aqueous side (Figure 3.20).  
7.3.197	Phospholipids are responsible for the dynamic nature of the plasma membrane.
7.3.198	If a drop of phospholipids is placed in water, it spontaneously forms a structure known as a micelle, where the hydrophilic phosphate heads face the outside and the fatty acids face the interior of this structure.  
7.3.199	Unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier, steroids have a fused ring structure.
7.3.200	Although they do not resemble the other lipids, they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobicand insoluble in water.
7.3.201	All steroids have four linked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail (Figure 3.21).
7.3.202	Many steroids also have the –OH functional group, which puts them in the alcohol classification (sterols).  
7.3.203	Cholesterol is the most common steroid.
7.3.204	Cholesterol is mainly synthesized in the liver and is the precursor to many steroid hormones such as testosterone and estradiol, which are secreted by the gonads and endocrine glands.
7.3.205	It is also the precursor to Vitamin D. Cholesterol is also the precursor of bile salts, which help in the emulsification of fats and their subsequent absorption by cells.
7.3.206	Although cholesterol is often spoken of in negative terms by lay people, it is necessary for proper functioning of the body.
7.3.207	It is a component of the plasma membrane of animal cells and is found within the phospholipid bilayer.
7.3.208	Being the outermost structure in animal cells, the plasma membrane is responsible for the transport of materials and cellular recognition and it is involved in cell-to-cell communication.  
7.3.209	Proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all macromolecules.
7.3.210	Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes.
7.3.211	Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of proteins, each with a unique function.
7.3.212	Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly.
7.3.213	They are all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence.  
7.3.214	Enzymes, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins.
7.3.215	Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on.
7.3.216	The enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions.
7.3.217	Enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic enzymes, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are called catalytic enzymes.
7.3.218	It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction and, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts.
7.3.219	An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch.  
7.3.220	Hormones are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction.
7.3.221	For example, insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level.
7.3.222	The primary types and functions of proteins are listed in Table 3.1.  
7.3.223	Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in nature.
7.3.224	For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein.
7.3.225	Protein shape is critical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds.
7.3.226	Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as denaturation.
7.3.227	All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids.  
7.3.228	Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins.
7.3.229	Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists of a central carbon atom, also known as the alpha (α) carbon, bonded to an amino group (NH2), a carboxyl group (COOH), and to a hydrogen atom.
7.3.230	Every amino acid also has another atom or group of atoms bonded to the central atom known as the R group (Figure 3.22).  
7.3.231	The name "amino acid" is derived from the fact that they contain both amino group and carboxyl-acid-group in their basic structure.
7.3.232	As mentioned, there are 20 amino acids present in proteins.
7.3.233	Ten of these are considered essential amino acids in humans because the human body cannot produce them and they are obtained from the diet.
7.3.234	For each amino acid, the R group (or side chain) is different (Figure 3.23).  
7.3.235	The chemical nature of the side chain determines the nature of the amino acid (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar).
7.3.236	For example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group.
7.3.237	Amino acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic side chains.
7.3.238	The side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also known as basic amino acids.
7.3.239	Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring- like structure.
7.3.240	Proline is an exception to the standard structure of an animo acid since its amino group is not separate from the side chain (Figure 3.23).  
7.3.241	Amino acids are represented by a single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation.
7.3.242	For example, valine is known by the letter V or the three-letter symbol val.
7.3.243	Just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet, some amino acids are necessary as well.
7.3.244	They are known as essential amino acids, and in humans they include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine.
7.3.245	Essential amino acids refer to those necessary for construction of proteins in the body, although not produced by the body; which amino acids are essential varies from organism to organism.  
7.3.246	The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein's shape, size, and function.
7.3.247	Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a dehydration reaction.
7.3.248	The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine, releasing a molecule of water.
7.3.249	The resulting bond is the peptide bond (Figure 3.24).  
7.3.250	The products formed by such linkages are called peptides.
7.3.251	As more amino acids join to this growing chain, the resulting chain is known as a polypeptide.
7.3.252	Each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end.
7.3.253	This end is called the N terminal, or the amino terminal, and the other end has a free carboxyl group, also known as the C or carboxyl terminal.
7.3.254	While the terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, often have bound non- peptide prosthetic groups, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function.
7.3.255	After protein synthesis (translation), most proteins are modified.
7.3.256	These are known as post-translational modifications.
7.3.257	They may undergo cleavage, phosphorylation, or may require the addition of other chemical groups.
7.3.258	Only after these modifications is the protein completely functional.  
7.3.259	As discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function.
7.3.260	For example, an enzyme can bind to a specific substrate at a site known as the active site.
7.3.261	If this active site is altered because of local changes or changes in overall protein structure, the enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate.
7.3.262	To understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.  
7.3.263	The unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure.
7.3.264	For example, the pancreatic hormone insulin has two polypeptide chains, A and B, and they are linked together by disulfide bonds.
7.3.265	The N terminal amino acid of the A chain is glycine, whereas the C terminal amino acid is asparagine (Figure 3.25).
7.3.266	The sequences of amino acids in the A and B chains are unique to insulin.  
7.3.267	The unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene encoding the protein.
7.3.268	A change in nucleotide sequence of the gene’s coding region may lead to a different amino acid being added to the growing polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein structure and function.
7.3.269	In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin β chain (a small portion of which is shown in Figure 3.26) has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in protein structure and function.
7.3.270	Specifically, the amino acid glutamic acid is substituted by valine in the β chain.
7.3.271	What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids.
7.3.272	The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids.
7.3.273	The structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule—which dramatically decreases life expectancy—is a single amino acid of the 600.
7.3.274	What is even more remarkable is that those 600 amino acids are encoded by three nucleotides each, and the mutation is caused by a single base change (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases.  
7.3.275	Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, hemoglobin molecules form long fibers that distort the biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood cells and assume a crescent or “sickle” shape, which clogs arteries (Figure 3.27).
7.3.276	This can lead to myriad serious health problems such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those affected by this disease.  
7.3.277	The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein.
7.3.278	The most common are the α-helix and β-pleated sheet structures (Figure 3.28).
7.3.279	Both structures are the α-helix structure—
7.3.280	the helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds.
7.3.281	The hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group in one amino acid and another amino acid that is four amino acids farther along the chain.  
7.3.282	Every helical turn in an alpha helix has 3.6 amino acid residues.
7.3.283	The R groups (the variant groups) of the polypeptide protrude out from the α-helix chain.
7.3.284	In the β-pleated sheet, the “pleats” are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the polypeptide chain.
7.3.285	The R groups are attached to the carbons and extend above and below the folds of the pleat.
7.3.286	The pleated segments align parallel or antiparallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the partially positive nitrogen atom in the amino group and the partially negative oxygen atom in the carbonyl group of the peptide backbone.
7.3.287	The α-helix and β-pleated sheet structures are found in most globular and fibrous proteins and they play an important structural role.  
7.3.288	The unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its tertiary structure (Figure 3.29).
7.3.289	This structure is in part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain.
7.3.290	Primarily, the interactions among R groups creates the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein.
7.3.291	The nature of the R groups found in the amino acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures.
7.3.292	For example, R groups with like charges are repelled by each other and those with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds).
7.3.293	When protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids lay in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups lay on the outside.
7.3.294	The former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions.
7.3.295	Interaction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the presence of oxygen, the only covalent bond forming during protein folding.  
7.3.296	All of these interactions, weak and strong, determine the final three-dimensional shape of the protein.
7.3.297	When a protein loses its three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional.  
7.3.298	In nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure.
7.3.299	Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure.
7.3.300	For example, insulin (a globular protein) has a combination of hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds that cause it to be mostly clumped into a ball shape.
7.3.301	Insulin starts out as a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the presence of post-translational modification after the formation of the disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains together.
7.3.302	Silk (a fibrous protein), however, has a β-pleated sheet structure that is the result of hydrogen bonding between different chains.  
7.3.303	The four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) are illustrated in Figure 3.30.  
7.3.304	Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape that are held together by chemical interactions.
7.3.305	If the protein is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation.
7.3.306	Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function.
7.3.307	Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function.
7.3.308	One example of irreversible protein denaturation is when an egg is fried.
7.3.309	The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan.
7.3.310	Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling.
7.3.311	The stomach is also very acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions.  
7.3.312	Protein folding is critical to its function.
7.3.313	It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process.
7.3.314	Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process.
7.3.315	They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded.  
7.3.316	Nucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life.
7.3.317	They carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and carry instructions for the functioning of the cell.  
7.3.318	The two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).
7.3.319	DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals.
7.3.320	It is found in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the organelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria.
7.3.321	In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a membranous envelope.  
7.3.322	The entire genetic content of a cell is known as its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics.
7.3.323	In eukaryotic cells but not in prokaryotes, DNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes.
7.3.324	A chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes.
7.3.325	Many genes contain the information to make protein products; other genes code for RNA products.
7.3.326	DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes “on” or “off.
7.3.327	”  
7.3.328	The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis.
7.3.329	The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell.
7.3.330	This intermediary is the messenger RNA (mRNA).
7.3.331	Other types of RNA—like rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA—are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.  
7.3.332	DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides.
7.3.333	The nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide, DNA or RNA.
7.3.334	Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five- carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group (Figure 3.31).
7.3.335	Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to one or more phosphate groups.  
7.3.336	The nitrogenous bases, important components of nucleotides, are organic molecules and are so named because they contain carbon and nitrogen.
7.3.337	They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra hydrogen, and thus, decreases the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment, making it more basic.
7.3.338	Each nucleotide in DNA contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) cytosine (C), and thymine (T).  
7.3.339	Adenine and guanine are classified as purines.
7.3.340	The primary structure of a purine is two carbon-nitrogen rings.
7.3.341	Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are classified as pyrimidines which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring as their primary structure (Figure 3.31).
7.3.342	Each of these basic carbon-nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it.
7.3.343	In molecular biology shorthand, the nitrogenous bases are simply known by their symbols A, T, G, C, and U. DNA contains A, T, G, and C
7.3.344	whereas RNA contains A, U, G, and C.  The pentose sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, and in RNA, the sugar is ribose (Figure 3.31).
7.3.345	The difference between the sugars is the presence of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the ribose and hydrogen on the second carbon of the deoxyribose.
7.3.346	The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′, and 5′ (1′ is read as “one prime”).
7.3.347	The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3′ carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, which forms a 5′–3′ phosphodiester linkage.
7.3.348	The phosphodiester linkage is not formed  by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules: its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups.
7.3.349	A polynucleotide may have thousands of such phosphodiester linkages.  
7.3.350	DNA has a double-helix structure (Figure 3.32).
7.3.351	The sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix, forming the backbone of the DNA.
7.3.352	The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a staircase, in pairs; the pairs are bound to each other by hydrogen bonds.
7.3.353	Every base pair in the double helivx is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm.
7.3.354	The two strands of the helix run in opposite directions, meaning that the 5′ carbon end of one strand will face the 3′ carbon end of its matching strand.
7.3.355	(This is referred to as antiparallel orientation and is important to DNA replication and in many nucleic acid interactions.)  
7.3.356	Only certain types of base pairing are allowed.
7.3.357	For example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine.
7.3.358	This means A can pair with T, and G can pair with C, as shown in Figure 3.33.
7.3.359	This is known as the base complementary rule.
7.3.360	In other words, the DNA strands are complementary to each other.
7.3.361	If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the complementary strand would have the sequence TTAACCGG.
7.3.362	During DNA replication, each strand is copied, resulting in a daughter DNA double helix containing one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand.  
7.3.363	Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is mainly involved in the process of protein synthesis under the direction of DNA.
7.3.364	RNA is usually single-stranded and is made of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds.
7.3.365	A ribonucleotide in the RNA chain contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A, U, G, and C), and the phosphate group.  
7.3.366	There are four major types of RNA:
7.3.367	messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and microRNA (miRNA).
7.3.368	The first, mRNA, carries the message from DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell.
7.3.369	If a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is turned “on” and the messenger RNA is synthesized in the nucleus.
7.3.370	The RNA base sequence is complementary to the coding sequence of the DNA from which it has been copied.
7.3.371	However, in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead.
7.3.372	If the DNA strand has a sequence AATTGCGC, the sequence of the complementary RNA is UUAACGCG.
7.3.373	In the cytoplasm, the mRNA interacts with ribosomes and other cellular machinery (Figure 3.34).  
7.3.374	The mRNA is read in sets of three bases known as codons.
7.3.375	Each codon codes for a single amino acid.
7.3.376	In this way, the mRNA is read and the protein product is made.
7.3.377	Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds.
7.3.378	The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome  also has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids.
7.3.379	Transfer RNA (tRNA) is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA, usually 70–90 nucleotides long.
7.3.380	It carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis.
7.3.381	It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain.
7.3.382	microRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their role involves the regulation of gene expression by interfering with the expression of certain mRNA messages.
7.3.383	Table 3.2 summarizes features of DNA and RNA.  
7.3.384	Even though the RNA is single stranded, most RNA types show extensive intramolecular base pairing between complementary sequences, creating a predictable three-dimensional structure essential for their function.  
7.3.385	As you have learned, information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein.
7.3.386	DNA dictates the structure of mRNA in a process known as transcription, and RNA dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation.
7.3.387	This is known as the Central Dogma of Life, which holds true for all organisms; however, exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections.  
7.3.388	Proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and lipids are the four major classes of biological macromolecules
7.3.389	—large molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules.
7.3.390	Macromolecules are made up of single units known as monomers that are joined by covalent bonds to form larger polymers.
7.3.391	The polymer is more than the sum of its parts: it acquires new characteristics, and leads to an osmotic pressure that is much lower than that formed by its ingredients; this is an important advantage in the maintenance of cellular osmotic conditions.
7.3.392	A monomer joins with another monomer with the release of a water molecule, leading to the formation of a covalent bond.
7.3.393	These types of reactions are known as dehydration or condensation reactions.
7.3.394	When polymers are broken down into smaller units (monomers), a molecule of water is used for each bond broken by these reactions; such reactions are known as hydrolysis reactions.
7.3.395	Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are similar for all macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific to its class.
7.3.396	Dehydration reactions typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation, while hydrolysis reactions typically release energy by breaking bonds.  
7.3.397	Carbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell and provide structural support to plant cells, fungi, and all of the arthropods that include lobsters, crabs, shrimp, insects, and spiders.
7.3.398	Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides depending on the number of monomers in the molecule.
7.3.399	Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds that are formed as a result of dehydration reactions, forming disaccharides and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond formed.
7.3.400	Glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose.
7.3.401	Starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively.
7.3.402	The long polysaccharide chains may be branched or unbranched.
7.3.403	Cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide, whereas amylopectin, a constituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule.
7.3.404	Storage of glucose, in the form of polymers like starch of glycogen, makes it slightly less accessible for metabolism; however, this prevents it from leaking out of the cell or creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by the cell.  
7.3.405	Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature.
7.3.406	Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.
7.3.407	Fats are a stored form of energy and are also known as triacylglycerols or triglycerides.
7.3.408	Fats are made up of fatty acids and either glycerol or sphingosine.
7.3.409	Fatty acids may be unsaturated or saturated, depending on the presence or absence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain.
7.3.410	If only single bonds are present, they are known as saturated fatty acids.
7.3.411	Unsaturated fatty acids may have one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain.
7.3.412	Phospholipids make up the matrix of membranes.
7.3.413	They have a glycerol or sphingosine backbone to which two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group are attached.
7.3.414	Steroids are another class of lipids.
7.3.415	Their basic structure has four fused carbon rings.
7.3.416	Cholesterol is a type of steroid and is an important constituent of the plasma membrane, where it helps to maintain the fluid nature of the membrane.
7.3.417	It is also the precursor of steroid hormones such as testosterone.  
7.3.418	Proteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of functions for the cell.
7.3.419	They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers, or hormones.
7.3.420	The building blocks of proteins (monomers) are amino acids.
7.3.421	Each amino acid has a central carbon that is linked to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and an R group or side chain.
7.3.422	There are 20 commonly occurring amino acids, each of which differs in the R group.
7.3.423	Each amino acid is linked to its neighbors by a peptide bond.
7.3.424	A long chain of amino acids is known as a polypeptide.  
7.3.425	Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and (optional) quaternary.
7.3.426	The primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids.
7.3.427	The local folding of the polypeptide to form structures such as the α helix and β-pleated sheet constitutes the secondary structure.
7.3.428	The overall three-dimensional structure is the tertiary structure.
7.3.429	When two or more polypeptides combine to form the complete protein structure, the configuration is known as the quaternary structure of a protein.
7.3.430	Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature or pH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function.  
7.3.431	Nucleic acids are molecules made up of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell division and protein synthesis.
7.3.432	Each nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group.
7.3.433	There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA.
7.3.434	DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring  
7.3.435	(in the form of chromosomes).
7.3.436	It has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions, connected by hydrogen bonds, and complementary to each other.
7.3.437	RNA is single-stranded and is made of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group.
7.3.438	RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.
7.3.439	Messenger RNA (mRNA) is copied from the DNA, is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and contains information for the construction of proteins.
7.3.440	Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a part of the ribosomes at the site of protein synthesis, whereas transfer RNA (tRNA) carries the amino acid to the site of protein synthesis.
7.3.441	microRNA regulates the use of mRNA for protein synthesis.  
7.3.442	Figure 3.2
7.3.443	In the dehydration synthesis reaction depicted above, two molecules of glucose are linked together to form the disaccharide maltose.
7.3.444	In the process, a water molecule is formed.
7.3.445	Figure 3.3
7.3.446	In the hydrolysis reaction shown here, the disaccharide maltose is broken down to form two glucose monomers with the addition of a water molecule.
7.3.447	Note that this reaction is the reverse of the synthesis reaction shown in Figure 3.2.
7.3.448	Figure 3.4 Monosaccharides are classified based on the position of their carbonyl group and the number of carbons in the backbone.
7.3.449	Aldoses have a carbonyl group (indicated in green) at the end of the carbon chain, and ketoses have a carbonyl group in the middle of the carbon chain.
7.3.450	Trioses, pentoses, and hexoses have three, five, and six carbon backbones, respectively.
7.3.451	Figure 3.6 Five and six carbon monosaccharides exist in equilibrium between linear and ring forms.
7.3.452	When the ring forms, the side chain it closes on is locked into an α or β position.
7.3.453	Fructose and ribose also form rings, although they form five-membered rings as opposed to the six-membered ring of glucose.
7.3.454	Figure 3.7 Sucrose is formed when a monomer of glucose and a monomer of fructose are joined in a dehydration reaction to form a glycosidic bond.
7.3.455	In the process, a water molecule is lost.
7.3.456	By convention, the carbon atoms in a monosaccharide are numbered from the terminal carbon closest to the carbonyl group.
7.3.457	In sucrose, a glycosidic linkage is formed between carbon 1 in glucose and carbon 2 in fructose.
7.3.458	Figure 3.8
7.3.459	Common disaccharides include maltose (grain sugar), lactose (milk sugar), and sucrose (table sugar).
7.3.460	Figure 3.9 Amylose and amylopectin are two different forms of starch.
7.3.461	Amylose is composed of unbranched chains of glucose monomers connected by α 1,4 glycosidic linkages.
7.3.462	Amylopectin is composed of branched chains of glucose monomers connected by α 1,4 and α 1,6 glycosidic linkages.
7.3.463	Because of the way the subunits are joined, the glucose chains have a helical structure.
7.3.464	Glycogen (not shown) is similar in structure to amylopectin but more highly branched.
7.3.465	Figure 3.10
7.3.466	In cellulose, glucose monomers are linked in unbranched chains by β 1-4 glycosidic linkages.
7.3.467	Because of the way the glucose subunits are joined, every glucose monomer is flipped relative to the next one resulting in a linear, fibrous structure.
7.3.468	Figure 3.11 Insects have a hard outer exoskeleton made of chitin, a type of polysaccharide.

7.3.470	Obesity is a worldwide health concern, and many diseases such as diabetes and heart disease are becoming more prevalent because of obesity.
7.3.471	This is one of the reasons why registered dietitians are increasingly sought after for advice.
7.3.472	Registered dietitians help plan nutrition programs for individuals in various settings.
7.3.473	They often work with patients in health care facilities, designing nutrition plans to treat and prevent diseases.
7.3.474	For example, dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood sugar levels by eating the correct types and amounts of carbohydrates.
7.3.475	Dietitians may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices.
7.3.476	To become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor’s degree in dietetics, nutrition, food technology, or a related field.
7.3.477	In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and pass a national exam.
7.3.478	Those who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human physiology.
7.3.479	Dietitians must become experts in the chemistry and physiology (biological functions) of food (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).

7.3.486	Figure 3.16 Saturated fatty acids have hydrocarbon chains connected by single bonds only.
7.3.487	Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double bonds.
7.3.488	Each double bond may be in a cis or trans configuration.
7.3.489	In the cis configuration, both hydrogens are on the same side of the hydrocarbon chain.
7.3.490	In the trans configuration, the hydrogens are on opposite sides.
7.3.491	A cis double bond causes a kink in the chain.

7.3.499	A phospholipid is a molecule with two fatty acids and a modified phosphate group attached to a glycerol backbone.
7.3.500	The phosphate may be modified by the addition of charged or polar chemical groups.
7.3.501	Two chemical groups that may modify the phosphate, choline and serine, are shown here.
7.3.502	Both choline and serine attach to the phosphate group at the position labeled R via the hydroxyl group indicated in green.

7.3.509	Amino acids have a central asymmetric carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain (R group) are attached.

7.3.511	The carboxyl group of one amino acid is linked to the amino group of the incoming amino acid.
7.3.512	In the process, a molecule of water is released.
7.3.513	Cytochrome c is an important component of the electron transport chain, a part of cellular respiration, and it is normally found in the cellular organelle, the mitochondrion.
7.3.514	This protein has a heme prosthetic group, and the central ion of the heme gets alternately reduced and oxidized during electron transfer.
7.3.515	Because this essential protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years.
7.3.516	Protein sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of cytochrome c amino acid sequence homology among different species; in other words, evolutionary kinship can be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among various species’ DNA or protein sequences.
7.3.517	Scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids.
7.3.518	For each cytochrome c molecule from different organisms that has been sequenced to date, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same position in all samples of cytochrome c.
7.3.519	This indicates that there may have been a common ancestor.
7.3.520	On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found.
7.3.521	When human and rhesus monkey sequences were compared, the single difference found was in one amino acid.
7.3.522	In another comparison, human to yeast sequencing shows a difference in the 44th position.

7.3.526	The amino acid cysteine (cys) has a sulfhydryl (SH) group as a side chain.
7.3.527	Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of oxygen to form a disulfide (S-S) bond.

7.3.537	The α-helix and β-pleated sheet are secondary structures of proteins that form because of hydrogen bonding between carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone.

7.3.546	A nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups.
7.3.547	Carbon residues in the pentose are numbered 1′ through 5′ (the prime distinguishes these residues from those in the base, which are numbered without using a prime notation).
7.3.548	The base is attached to the 1′ position of the ribose, and the phosphate is attached to the 5′ position.
7.3.549	When a polynucleotide is formed, the 5′ phosphate of the incoming nucleotide attaches to the 3′ hydroxyl group at the end of the growing chain.
7.3.550	Two types of pentose are found in nucleotides, deoxyribose (found in DNA) and ribose (found in RNA).
7.3.551	Deoxyribose is similar in structure to ribose, but it has an H instead of an OH at the 2′ position.
7.3.552	Bases can be divided into two categories: purines and pyrimidines.
7.3.553	Purines have a double ring structure, and pyrimidines have a single ring.

7.4.0	Close your eyes and picture a brick wall.
7.4.1	What is the basic building block of that wall?
7.4.2	A single brick, of course.
7.4.3	Like a brick wall, your body is composed of basic building blocks, and the building blocks of your body are cells.
7.4.4	Your body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for a specific purpose.
7.4.5	Just as a home is made from a variety of building materials, the human body is constructed from many cell types.
7.4.6	For example, epithelial cells protect the surface of the body and cover the organs and body cavities within.
7.4.7	Bone cells help to support and protect the body.
7.4.8	Cells of the immune system fight invading bacteria.
7.4.9	Additionally, blood and blood cells carry nutrients and oxygen throughout the body while removing carbon dioxide.
7.4.10	Each of these cell types plays a vital role during the growth, development, and day-to-day maintenance of the body.
7.4.11	In spite of their enormous variety, however, cells from all organisms—even ones as diverse as bacteria, onion, and human—share certain fundamental characteristics.
7.4.12	A cell is the smallest unit of a living thing.
7.4.13	A living thing, whether made of one cell (like bacteria) or many cells (like a human), is called an organism.
7.4.14	Thus, cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms.
7.4.15	Several cells of one kind that interconnect with each other and perform a shared function form tissues, several tissues combine to form an organ (your stomach, heart, or brain), and several organs make up an organ system (such as the digestive system, circulatory system, or nervous system).
7.4.16	Several systems that function together form an organism (like a human being).
7.4.17	Here, we will examine the structure and function of cells.
7.4.18	There are many types of cells, all grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.
7.4.19	For example, both animal and plant cells are classified as eukaryotic cells, whereas bacterial cells are classified as prokaryotic.
7.4.20	Before discussing the criteria for determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, let’s first examine how biologists study cells.
7.4.21	Microscopy Cells vary in size.
7.4.22	With few exceptions, individual cells cannot be seen with the naked eye, so scientists use microscopes (micro- = “small”; -scope =
7.4.23	“to look at”) to study them.
7.4.24	A microscope is an instrument that magnifies an object.
7.4.25	Most photographs of cells are taken with a microscope, and these images can also be called micrographs.
7.4.26	The optics of a microscope’s lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees.
7.4.27	A specimen that is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing left when viewed through a microscope, and vice versa.
7.4.28	Similarly, if the slide is moved left while looking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and if moved down, it will seem to move up.
7.4.29	This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image.
7.4.30	Because of the manner by which light travels through the lenses, this system of two lenses produces an inverted image (binocular, or dissecting microscopes, work in a similar manner, but include an additional magnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright).
7.4.31	Light Microscopes
7.4.32	To give you a sense of cell size, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers (
7.4.33	abbreviated as eight μm) in diameter; the head of a pin of is about two thousandths of a meter (two mm) in diameter.
7.4.34	That means about 250 red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin.
7.4.35	Most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes (Figure 4.2a).
7.4.36	Visible light passes and is bent through the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen.
7.4.37	Light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains.
7.4.38	Staining, however, usually kills the cells.
7.4.39	Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times.
7.4.40	Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power.
7.4.41	Magnification is the process of enlarging an object in appearance.
7.4.42	Resolving power is the ability of a microscope to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate: the higher the resolution, the better the clarity and detail of the image.
7.4.43	When oil immersion lenses are used for the study of small objects, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times.
7.4.44	In order to gain a better understanding of cellular structure and function, scientists typically use electron microscopes.
7.4.45	Most light microscopes used in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times and have a resolution of about 200 nanometers.
7.4.46	(b) Electron microscopes provide a much higher magnification, 100,000x, and a have a resolution of 50 picometers.
7.4.47	Electron Microscopes
7.4.48	In contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes (Figure 4.2b) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light.
7.4.49	Not only does this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 4.3), it also provides higher resolving power.
7.4.50	The method used to prepare the specimen for viewing with an electron microscope kills the specimen.
7.4.51	Electrons have short wavelengths (shorter than photons) that move best in a vacuum, so living cells cannot be viewed with an electron microscope.
7.4.52	In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell’s surface, creating details of cell surface characteristics.
7.4.53	In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam penetrates the cell and provides details of a cell’s internal structures.
7.4.54	As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than light microscopes.
7.4.55	These Salmonella bacteria appear as tiny purple dots when viewed with a light microscope.
7.4.56	(b)
7.4.57	This scanning electron microscope micrograph shows Salmonella bacteria (in red) invading human cells (yellow).
7.4.58	Even though subfigure (b) shows a different Salmonella specimen than subfigure (a), you can still observe the comparative increase in magnification and detail.
7.4.59	Cell Theory
7.4.60	The microscopes we use today are far more complex than those used in the 1600s by Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch shopkeeper who had great skill in crafting lenses.
7.4.61	Despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of protista (a type of single-celled organism) and sperm, which he collectively termed “animalcules.
7.4.62	”
7.4.63	In a 1665 publication called Micrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens.
7.4.64	In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa.
7.4.65	Later advances in lenses, microscope construction, and staining techniques enabled other scientists to see some components inside cells.
7.4.66	By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified cell theory, which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells.
7.4.67	Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory.
7.4.68	Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.
7.4.69	Only the predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro-
7.4.70	= “before”; -kary- =
7.4.71	“nucleus”).
7.4.72	Cells of animals, plants, fungi, and protists are all eukaryotes (ceu- = “true”) and are made up of eukaryotic cells.
7.4.73	Components of Prokaryotic Cells
7.4.74	All cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell
7.4.75	’s interior from its surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like cytosol within the cell in which other cellular components are found; 3) DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and 4) ribosomes, which synthesize proteins.
7.4.76	However, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways.
7.4.77	A prokaryote is a simple, mostly single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle.
7.4.78	We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes.
7.4.79	Prokaryotic DNA is found in a central part of the cell: the nucleoid.
7.4.80	This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell.
7.4.81	All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA localized in a nucleoid, ribosomes, a cell membrane, and a cell wall.
7.4.82	The other structures shown are present in some, but not all, bacteria.
7.4.83	Most prokaryotes have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 4.5).
7.4.84	The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration.
7.4.85	The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment.
7.4.86	Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae.
7.4.87	Flagella are used for locomotion.
7.4.88	Pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation.
7.4.89	Fimbriae are used by bacteria to attach to a host cell.
7.4.90	Cell Size
7.4.91	At 0.1 to 5.0 μm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging from 10 to 100 μm (Figure 4.6).
7.4.92	The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly diffuse to other parts of the cell.
7.4.93	Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse out.
7.4.94	This is not the case in eukaryotic cells, which have developed different structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport.
7.4.95	This figure shows relative sizes of microbes on a logarithmic scale (recall that each unit of increase in a logarithmic scale represents a 10-fold increase in the quantity being measured).
7.4.96	Small size, in general, is necessary for all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic.
7.4.97	Let’s examine why that is so.
7.4.98	First, we’ll consider the area and volume of a typical cell.
7.4.99	Not all cells are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a sphere.
7.4.100	You may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4πr2, while the formula for its volume is 4πr3/3.
7.4.101	Thus, as the radius of a cell increases, its surface area increases as the square of its radius, but its volume increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly).
7.4.102	Therefore, as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases.
7.4.103	This same principle would apply if the cell had the shape of a cube (Figure 4.7).
7.4.104	If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume.
7.4.105	In other words, as a cell grows, it becomes less efficient.
7.4.106	One way to become more efficient is to divide; another way is to develop organelles that perform specific tasks.
7.4.107	These adaptations lead to the development of more sophisticated cells called eukaryotic cells.
7.4.108	Have you ever heard the phrase “form follows function?
7.4.109	”
7.4.110	It’s a philosophy practiced in many industries.
7.4.111	In architecture, this means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out inside them.
7.4.112	For example, a skyscraper should be built with several elevator banks; a hospital should be built so that its emergency room is easily accessible.
7.4.113	Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology, and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells ( Figure 4.8).
7.4.114	Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have: 1) a membrane-bound nucleus; 2) numerous membrane-bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, chloroplasts, mitochondria, and others; and 3) several, rod-shaped chromosomes.
7.4.115	Because a eukaryotic cell’s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane, it is often said to have a “true nucleus.
7.4.116	”
7.4.117	The word “organelle” means “little organ,” and, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have specialized functions.
7.4.118	At this point, it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells.
7.4.119	Organelles allow different functions to be compartmentalized in different areas of the cell.
7.4.120	Before turning to organelles, let’s first examine two important components of the cell: the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.
7.4.121	The Plasma Membrane Like prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane ( Figure 4.9), a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins that separates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment.
7.4.122	A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group.
7.4.123	The plasma membrane controls the passage of organic molecules, ions, water, and oxygen into and out of the cell.
7.4.124	Wastes (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia) also leave the cell by passing through the plasma membrane.
7.4.125	The eukaryotic plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with proteins and cholesterol embedded in it.
7.4.126	The plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption are folded into fingerlike projections called microvilli (singular = microvillus); ( Figure 4.10).
7.4.127	Such cells are typically found lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food.
7.4.128	This is an excellent example of form following function.
7.4.129	People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.
7.4.130	The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients.
7.4.131	This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea.
7.4.132	Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.
7.4.133	Microvilli, shown here as they appear on cells lining the small intestine, increase the surface area available for absorption.
7.4.134	These microvilli are only found on the area of the plasma membrane that faces the cavity from which substances will be absorbed.
7.4.135	The Cytoplasm
7.4.136	The cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a structure to be discussed shortly).
7.4.137	It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel-like cytosol, the cytoskeleton, and various chemicals ( Figure 4.8).
7.4.138	Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-solid consistency, which comes from the proteins within it.
7.4.139	However, proteins are not the only organic molecules found in the cytoplasm.
7.4.140	Glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol are found there, too.
7.4.141	Ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other elements are also dissolved in the cytoplasm.
7.4.142	Many metabolic reactions, including protein synthesis, take place in the cytoplasm.
7.4.143	The Nucleus Typically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell ( Figure 4.8).
7.4.144	The nucleus (plural = nuclei) houses the cell’s DNA and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins.
7.4.145	Let’s look at it in more detail ( Figure 4.11).
7.4.146	The nucleus stores chromatin (DNA plus proteins) in a gel-like substance called the nucleoplasm.
7.4.147	The nucleolus is a condensed region of chromatin where ribosome synthesis occurs.
7.4.148	The boundary of the nucleus is called the nuclear envelope.
7.4.149	It consists of two phospholipid bilayers: an outer membrane and an inner membrane.
7.4.150	The nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum.
7.4.151	Nuclear pores allow substances to enter and exit the nucleus.
7.4.152	The Nuclear Envelope
7.4.153	The nuclear envelope is a double-membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus ( Figure 4.11).
7.4.154	Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers.
7.4.155	The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm.
7.4.156	The nucleoplasm is the semi-solid fluid inside the nucleus, where we find the chromatin and the nucleolus.
7.4.157	Chromatin and Chromosomes To understand chromatin, it is helpful to first consider chromosomes.
7.4.158	Chromosomes are structures within the nucleus that are made up of DNA, the hereditary material.
7.4.159	You may remember that in prokaryotes, DNA is organized into a single circular chromosome.
7.4.160	In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures.
7.4.161	Every eukaryotic species has a specific number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its body’s cells.
7.4.162	For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, while in fruit flies, it is eight.
7.4.163	Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide.
7.4.164	When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, proteins are attached to chromosomes, and they resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch of threads.
7.4.165	These unwound protein-chromosome complexes are called chromatin ( Figure 4.12); chromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed.
7.4.166	This image shows various levels of the organization of chromatin (DNA and protein).
7.4.167	(b)
7.4.168	This image shows paired chromosomes.
7.4.169	The Nucleolus
7.4.170	We already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this?
7.4.171	Some chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA.
7.4.172	A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus (plural = nucleoli) aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm.
7.4.173	Ribosomes Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis.
7.4.174	When viewed through an electron microscope, ribosomes appear either as clusters (polyribosomes) or single, tiny dots that float freely in the cytoplasm.
7.4.175	They may be attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope ( Figure 4.8).
7.4.176	Electron microscopy has shown us that ribosomes, which are large complexes of protein and RNA, consist of two subunits, aptly called large and small ( Figure 4.13).
7.4.177	Ribosomes receive their “orders” for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA).
7.4.178	The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids in a protein.
7.4.179	Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
7.4.180	Ribosomes are made up of a large subunit (top) and a small subunit (bottom).
7.4.181	During protein synthesis, ribosomes assemble amino acids into proteins.
7.4.182	Because proteins synthesis is an essential function of all cells (including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, pigments, structural components, and surface receptors), ribosomes are found in practically every cell.
7.4.183	Ribosomes are particularly abundant in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein.
7.4.184	For example, the pancreas is responsible for creating several digestive enzymes and the cells that produce these enzymes contain many ribosomes.
7.4.185	Thus, we see another example of form following function.
7.4.186	Mitochondria Mitochondria (singular = mitochondrion) are often called the “powerhouses” or “energy factories” of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule.
7.4.187	ATP represents the short-term stored energy of the cell.
7.4.188	Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy found in glucose and other nutrients.
7.4.189	In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product.
7.4.190	In fact, the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct.
7.4.191	In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP.
7.4.192	Your muscle cells need a lot of energy to keep your body moving.
7.4.193	When your cells don’t get enough oxygen, they do not make a lot of ATP.
7.4.194	Instead, the small amount of ATP they make in the absence of oxygen is accompanied by the production of lactic acid.
7.4.195	Mitochondria are oval-shaped, double membrane organelles ( Figure 4.14) that have their own ribosomes and DNA.
7.4.196	Each membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins.
7.4.197	The inner layer has folds called cristae.
7.4.198	The area surrounded by the folds is called the mitochondrial matrix.
7.4.199	The cristae and the matrix have different roles in cellular respiration.
7.4.200	This electron micrograph shows a mitochondrion as viewed with a transmission electron microscope.
7.4.201	This organelle has an outer membrane and an inner membrane.
7.4.202	The inner membrane contains folds, called cristae, which increase its surface area.
7.4.203	The space between the two membranes is called the intermembrane space, and the space inside the inner membrane is called the mitochondrial matrix.
7.4.204	ATP synthesis takes place on the inner membrane.
7.4.205	(credit: modification of work by Matthew Britton; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.4.206	Peroxisomes Peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes.
7.4.207	They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids.
7.4.208	They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body.
7.4.209	(Many of these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water.)
7.4.210	For example, alcohol is detoxified by peroxisomes in liver cells.
7.4.211	Glyoxysomes, which are specialized peroxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars.
7.4.212	Vesicles and Vacuoles Vesicles and vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport.
7.4.213	Other than the fact that vacuoles are somewhat larger than vesicles, there is a very subtle distinction between them: The membranes of vesicles can fuse with either the plasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell.
7.4.214	Additionally, some agents such as enzymes within plant vacuoles break down macromolecules.
7.4.215	The membrane of a vacuole does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular components.
7.4.216	Animal Cells versus Plant Cells
7.4.217	At this point, you know that each eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, a nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and in some, vacuoles, but there are some striking differences between animal and plant cells.
7.4.218	While both animal and plant cells have microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), animal cells also have centrioles associated with the MTOC: a complex called the centrosome.
7.4.219	Animal cells each have a centrosome and lysosomes, whereas plant cells do not.
7.4.220	Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts and other specialized plastids, and a large central vacuole, whereas animal cells do not.
7.4.221	The Centrosome
7.4.222	The centrosome is a microtubule-organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells.
7.4.223	It contains a pair of centrioles, two structures that lie perpendicular to each other ( Figure 4.15).
7.4.224	Each centriole is a cylinder of nine triplets of microtubules.
7.4.225	The centrosome consists of two centrioles that lie at right angles to each other.
7.4.226	Each centriole is a cylinder made up of nine triplets of microtubules.
7.4.227	Nontubulin proteins (indicated by the green lines) hold the microtubule triplets together.
7.4.228	The centrosome (the organelle where all microtubules originate) replicates itself before a cell divides, and the centrioles appear to have some role in pulling the duplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell.
7.4.229	However, the exact function of the centrioles in cell division isn’t clear, because cells that have had the centrosome removed can still divide, and plant cells, which lack centrosomes, are capable of cell division.
7.4.230	Lysosomes Animal cells have another set of organelles not found in plant cells: lysosomes.
7.4.231	The lysosomes are the cell’s “garbage disposal.
7.4.232	”
7.4.233	In plant cells, the digestive processes take place in vacuoles.
7.4.234	Enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles.
7.4.235	These enzymes are active at a much lower pH than that of the cytoplasm.
7.4.236	Therefore, the pH within lysosomes is more acidic than the pH of the cytoplasm.
7.4.237	Many reactions that take place in the cytoplasm could not occur at a low pH, so again, the advantage of compartmentalizing the eukaryotic cell into organelles is apparent.
7.4.238	The Cell Wall If you examine Figure 4.8b, the diagram of a plant cell, you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane called the cell wall.
7.4.239	The cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell.
7.4.240	Fungal and protistan cells also have cell walls.
7.4.241	While the chief component of prokaryotic cell walls is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant cell wall is cellulose ( Figure 4.16), a polysaccharide made up of glucose units.
7.4.242	Have you ever noticed that when you bite into a raw vegetable, like celery, it crunches?
7.4.243	That’s because you are tearing the rigid cell walls of the celery cells with your teeth.
7.4.244	Cellulose is a long chain of β-glucose molecules connected by a 1-4 linkage.
7.4.245	The dashed lines at each end of the figure indicate a series of many more glucose units.
7.4.246	The size of the page makes it impossible to portray an entire cellulose molecule.
7.4.247	Chloroplasts Like the mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes, but chloroplasts have an entirely different function.
7.4.248	Chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis.
7.4.249	Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon dioxide, water, and light energy to make glucose and oxygen.
7.4.250	This is a major difference between plants and animals; plants (autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like sugars, while animals (heterotrophs) must ingest their food.
7.4.251	Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplast’s inner membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked fluid-filled membrane sacs called thylakoids ( Figure 4.17).
7.4.252	Each stack of thylakoids is called a granum (plural = grana).
7.4.253	The fluid enclosed by the inner membrane that surrounds the grana is called the stroma.
7.4.254	The chloroplast has an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and membrane structures called thylakoids that are stacked into grana.
7.4.255	The space inside the thylakoid membranes is called the thylakoid space.
7.4.256	The light harvesting reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes, and the synthesis of sugar takes place in the fluid inside the inner membrane, which is called the stroma.
7.4.257	Chloroplasts also have their own genome, which is contained on a single circular chromosome.
7.4.258	The chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of photosynthesis.
7.4.259	Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts.
7.4.260	Some bacteria perform photosynthesis, but their chlorophyll is not relegated to an organelle.
7.4.261	Previously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells.
7.4.262	If you look at Figure 4.8b, you will see that plant cells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the area of the cell.
7.4.263	The central vacuole plays a key role in regulating the cell’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions.
7.4.264	Have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days, it wilts?
7.4.265	That’s because as the water concentration in the soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and cytoplasm.
7.4.266	As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported.
7.4.267	This loss of support to the cell walls of plant cells results in the wilted appearance of the plant.
7.4.268	The central vacuole also supports the expansion of the cell.
7.4.269	When the central vacuole holds more water, the cell gets larger without having to invest a lot of energy in synthesizing new cytoplasm.
7.4.270	The endomembrane system (endo = “within”) is a group of membranes and organelles (Figure 4.18) in eukaryotic cells that works together to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins.
7.4.271	It includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, and vesicles, which we’ve already mentioned, and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly.
7.4.272	Although not technically within the cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will see, it interacts with the other endomembranous organelles.
7.4.273	The endomembrane system does not include the membranes of either mitochondria or chloroplasts.
7.4.274	The Endoplasmic Reticulum
7.4.275	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 4.18) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids.
7.4.276	However, these two functions are performed in separate areas of the ER: the rough ER and the smooth ER, respectively.
7.4.277	The hollow portion of the ER tubules is called the lumen or cisternal space.
7.4.278	The membrane of the ER, which is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins, is continuous with the nuclear envelope.
7.4.279	Rough ER
7.4.280	The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface give it a studded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope.
7.4.281	This transmission electron micrograph shows the rough endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles in a pancreatic cell.
7.4.282	Ribosomes transfer their newly synthesized proteins into the lumen of the RER where they undergo structural modifications, such as folding or the acquisition of side chains.
7.4.283	These modified proteins will be incorporated into cellular membranes—the membrane of the ER or those of other organelles—or secreted from the cell (such as protein hormones, enzymes).
7.4.284	The RER also makes phospholipids for cellular membranes.
7.4.285	If the phospholipids or modified proteins are not destined to stay in the RER, they will reach their destinations via transport vesicles that bud from the RER’s membrane
7.4.286	(Figure 4.18).
7.4.287	Since the RER is engaged in modifying proteins (such as enzymes, for example) that will be secreted from the cell, you would be correct in assuming that the RER is abundant in cells that secrete proteins.
7.4.288	This is the case with cells of the liver, for example.
7.4.289	Smooth ER
7.4.290	The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface (Figure 4.18).
7.4.291	Functions of the SER include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, and steroid hormones; detoxification of medications and poisons; and storage of calcium ions.
7.4.292	In muscle cells, a specialized SER called the sarcoplasmic reticulum is responsible for storage of the calcium ions that are needed to trigger the coordinated contractions of the muscle cells.
7.4.293	The Golgi Apparatus We have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER and transport their contents elsewhere, but where do the vesicles go?
7.4.294	Before reaching their final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be sorted, packaged, and tagged so that they wind up in the right place.
7.4.295	Sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins takes place in the Golgi apparatus (also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranes.
7.4.296	The Golgi apparatus in this white blood cell is visible as a stack of semicircular, flattened rings in the lower portion of the image.
7.4.297	Several vesicles can be seen near the Golgi apparatus.
7.4.298	(credit: modification of work by Louisa Howard)
7.4.299	The receiving side of the Golgi apparatus is called the cis face.
7.4.300	The opposite side is called the trans face.
7.4.301	The transport vesicles that formed from the ER travel to the cis face, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus.
7.4.302	As the proteins and lipids travel through the Golgi, they undergo further modifications that allow them to be sorted.
7.4.303	The most frequent modification is the addition of short chains of sugar molecules.
7.4.304	These newly modified proteins and lipids are then tagged with phosphate groups or other small molecules so that they can be routed to their proper destinations.
7.4.305	Finally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into secretory vesicles that bud from the trans face of the Golgi.
7.4.306	While some of these vesicles deposit their contents into other parts of the cell where they will be used, other secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell.
7.4.307	In another example of form following function, cells that engage in a great deal of secretory activity (such as cells of the salivary glands that secrete digestive enzymes or cells of the immune system that secrete antibodies) have an abundance of Golgi.
7.4.308	In plant cells, the Golgi apparatus has the additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated into the cell wall and some of which are used in other parts of the cell.
7.4.309	Lysosomes
7.4.310	In addition to their role as the digestive component and organelle-recycling facility of animal cells, lysosomes are considered to be parts of the endomembrane system.
7.4.311	Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy pathogens (disease-causing organisms) that might enter the cell.
7.4.312	A good example of this occurs in a group of white blood cells called macrophages, which are part of your body’s immune system.
7.4.313	In a process known as phagocytosis or endocytosis, a section of the plasma membrane of the macrophage invaginates (folds in) and engulfs a pathogen.
7.4.314	The invaginated section, with the pathogen inside, then pinches itself off from the plasma membrane and becomes a vesicle.
7.4.315	The vesicle fuses with a lysosome.
7.4.316	The lysosome’s hydrolytic enzymes then destroy the pathogen.
7.4.317	A macrophage has engulfed (phagocytized) a potentially pathogenic bacterium and then fuses with a lysosomes within the cell to destroy the pathogen.
7.4.318	Other organelles are present in the cell but for simplicity are not shown.
7.4.319	If you were to remove all the organelles from a cell, would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be the only components left?
7.4.320	No.
7.4.321	Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the shape of the cell, secure some organelles in specific positions, allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move.
7.4.322	Collectively, this network of protein fibers is known as the cytoskeleton.
7.4.323	There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 4.22).
7.4.324	Here, we will examine each.
7.4.325	Microfilaments thicken the cortex around the inner edge of a cell; like rubber bands, they resist tension.
7.4.326	Microtubules are found in the interior of the cell where they maintain cell shape by resisting compressive forces.
7.4.327	Intermediate filaments are found throughout the cell and hold organelles in place.
7.4.328	Microfilaments Of the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton, microfilaments are the narrowest.
7.4.329	They function in cellular movement, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin (Figure 4.23).
7.4.330	For this reason, microfilaments are also known as actin filaments.
7.4.331	Actin is powered by ATP to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein called myosin.
7.4.332	This enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in animal cells and cytoplasmic streaming, which is the circular movement of the cell cytoplasm in plant cells.
7.4.333	Actin and myosin are plentiful in muscle cells.
7.4.334	When your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract.
7.4.335	Microfilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell.
7.4.336	They can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly, thus enabling a cell to change its shape and move.
7.4.337	White blood cells (your body’s infection-fighting cells) make good use of this ability.
7.4.338	They can move to the site of an infection and phagocytize the pathogen.
7.4.339	Intermediate Filaments Intermediate filaments are made of several strands of fibrous proteins that are wound together (Figure 4.24).
7.4.340	These elements of the cytoskeleton get their name from the fact that their diameter, 8 to 10 nm, is between those of microfilaments and microtubules.
7.4.341	Intermediate filaments consist of several intertwined strands of fibrous proteins.
7.4.342	Intermediate filaments have no role in cell movement.
7.4.343	Their function is purely structural.
7.4.344	They bear tension, thus maintaining the shape of the cell, and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place.
7.4.345	Figure 4.22 shows how intermediate filaments create a supportive scaffolding inside the cell.
7.4.346	The intermediate filaments are the most diverse group of cytoskeletal elements.
7.4.347	Several types of fibrous proteins are found in the intermediate filaments.
7.4.348	You are probably most familiar with keratin, the fibrous protein that strengthens your hair, nails, and the epidermis of the skin.
7.4.349	Microtubules
7.4.350	As their name implies, microtubules are small hollow tubes.
7.4.351	The walls of the microtubule are made of polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin, two globular proteins (Figure 4.25).
7.4.352	With a diameter of about 25 nm, microtubules are the widest components of the cytoskeleton.
7.4.353	They help the cell resist compression, provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell.
7.4.354	Like microfilaments, microtubules can dissolve and reform quickly.
7.4.355	Microtubules are hollow.
7.4.356	Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin (right image).
7.4.357	The left image shows the molecular structure of the tube.
7.4.358	Microtubules are also the structural elements of flagella, cilia, and centrioles (the latter are the two perpendicular bodies of the centrosome).
7.4.359	In fact, in animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center.
7.4.360	In eukaryotic cells, flagella and cilia are quite different structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as discussed below.
7.4.361	Flagella and Cilia
7.4.362	To refresh your memory, flagella (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell (for example, sperm, Euglena).
7.4.363	When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella.
7.4.364	When cilia (singular = cilium) are present, however, many of them extend along the entire surface of the plasma membrane.
7.4.365	They are short, hair-like structures that are used to move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along the outer surface of the cell (for example, the cilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.)
7.4.366	Despite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules called a “9 + 2 array.
7.4.367	”
7.4.368	This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule doublets, surrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center (Figure 4.26).
7.4.369	You already know that a group of similar cells working together is called a tissue.
7.4.370	As you might expect, if cells are to work together, they must communicate with each other, just as you need to communicate with others if you work on a group project.
7.4.371	Let’s take a look at how cells communicate with each other.
7.4.372	Extracellular Matrix of Animal Cells Most animal cells release materials into the extracellular space.
7.4.373	The primary components of these materials are proteins, and the most abundant protein is collagen.
7.4.374	Collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate-containing protein molecules called proteoglycans.
7.4.375	Collectively, these materials are called the extracellular matrix (Figure 4.27).
7.4.376	Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other.
7.4.377	How can this happen?
7.4.378	The extracellular matrix consists of a network of proteins and carbohydrates.
7.4.379	Cells have protein receptors on the extracellular surfaces of their plasma membranes.
7.4.380	When a molecule within the matrix binds to the receptor, it changes the molecular structure of the receptor.
7.4.381	The receptor, in turn, changes the conformation of the microfilaments positioned just inside the plasma membrane.
7.4.382	These conformational changes induce chemical signals inside the cell that reach the nucleus and turn “on” or “off” the transcription of specific sections of DNA, which affects the production of associated proteins, thus changing the activities within the cell.
7.4.383	Blood clotting provides an example of the role of the extracellular matrix in cell communication.
7.4.384	When the cells lining a blood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor.
7.4.385	When tissue factor binds with another factor in the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel, stimulates the adjacent smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and initiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors.
7.4.386	Intercellular Junctions Cells can also communicate with each other via direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions.
7.4.387	There are some differences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this.
7.4.388	Plasmodesmata are junctions between plant cells, whereas animal cell contacts include tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.
7.4.389	Plasmodesmata
7.4.390	In general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because they are separated by the cell wall that surrounds each cell (Figure 4.8b).
7.4.391	How then, can a plant transfer water and other soil nutrients from its roots, through its stems, and to its leaves?
7.4.392	Such transport uses the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) primarily.
7.4.393	There also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata (singular = plasmodesma), numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connect their cytoplasm, and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell, and thus throughout the plant.
7.4.394	A plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent plant cells.
7.4.395	Plasmodesmata allow materials to pass from the cytoplasm of one plant cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell.
7.4.396	Tight Junctions
7.4.397	A tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells (Figure 4.29).
7.4.398	The cells are held tightly against each other by proteins (predominantly two proteins called claudins and occludins).
7.4.399	Tight junctions form watertight connections between adjacent animal cells.
7.4.400	Proteins create tight junction adherence.
7.4.401	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.4.402	This tight adherence prevents materials from leaking between the cells; tight junctions are typically found in epithelial tissues that line internal organs and cavities, and comprise most of the skin.
7.4.403	For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells lining your urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking out into the extracellular space.
7.4.404	Desmosomes Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (Figure 4.30).
7.4.405	Short proteins called cadherins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes.
7.4.406	The cadherins join two adjacent cells together and maintain the cells in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and muscles.
7.4.407	A desmosome forms a very strong spot weld between cells.
7.4.408	It is created by the linkage of cadherins and intermediate filaments.
7.4.409	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal) Gap Junctions Gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate (Figure 4.31).
7.4.410	Structurally, however, gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ.
7.4.411	A gap junction is a protein-lined pore that allows water and small molecules to pass between adjacent animal cells.
7.4.412	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.4.413	Gap junctions develop when a set of six proteins (called connexins) in the plasma membrane arrange themselves in an elongated donut-like configuration called a connexon.
7.4.414	When the pores (“doughnut holes”) of connexons in adjacent animal cells align, a channel between the two cells forms.
7.4.415	Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle: The electrical signal for the muscle to contract is passed efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in tandem.
7.5.0	Introduction
7.5.1	The plasma membrane, which is also called the cell membrane, has many functions, but the most basic one is to define the borders of the cell and keep the cell functional.
7.5.2	The plasma membrane is selectively permeable.
7.5.3	This means that the membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell, while other materials cannot move freely, but require the use of a specialized structure, and occasionally, even energy investment for crossing.
7.5.4	A cell’s plasma membrane defines the cell, outlines its borders, and determines the nature of its interaction with its environment (see Table 5.1 for a summary).
7.5.5	Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities.
7.5.6	The plasma membrane must be very flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries.
7.5.7	These are the more obvious functions of a plasma membrane.
7.5.8	In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital for tissue and organ formation during early development, and which later plays a role in the “self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response.
7.5.9	Among the most sophisticated functions of the plasma membrane is the ability to transmit signals by means of complex, integral proteins known as receptors.
7.5.10	These proteins act both as receivers of extracellular inputs and as activators of intracellular processes.
7.5.11	These membrane receptors provide extracellular attachment sites for effectors like hormones and growth factors, and they activate intracellular response cascades when their effectors are bound.
7.5.12	Occasionally, receptors are hijacked by viruses (HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, is one example) that use them to gain entry into cells, and at times, the genes encoding receptors become mutated, causing the process of signal transduction to malfunction with disastrous consequences.
7.5.13	Fluid Mosaic Model
7.5.14	The existence of the plasma membrane was identified in the 1890s, and its chemical components were identified in 1915.
7.5.15	The principal components identified at that time were lipids and proteins.
7.5.16	The first widely accepted model of the plasma membrane’s structure was proposed in 1935 by Hugh Davson and James Danielli; it was based on the “railroad track” appearance of the plasma membrane in early electron micrographs.
7.5.17	They theorized that the structure of the plasma membrane resembles a sandwich, with protein being analogous to the bread, and lipids being analogous to the filling.
7.5.18	In the 1950s, advances in microscopy, notably transmission electron microscopy (TEM), allowed researchers to see that the core of the plasma membrane consisted of a double, rather than a single, layer.
7.5.19	A new model that better explains both the microscopic observations and the function of that plasma membrane was proposed by S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson in 1972.
7.5.20	The explanation proposed by Singer and Nicolson is called the fluid mosaic model.
7.5.21	The model has evolved somewhat over time, but it still best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them.
7.5.22	The fluid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates—that gives the membrane a fluid character.
7.5.23	Plasma membranes range from 5 to 10 nm in thickness.
7.5.24	For comparison, human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 μm wide, or approximately 1,000 times wider than a plasma membrane.
7.5.25	The membrane does look a bit like a sandwich.
7.5.26	The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination of phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins.
7.5.27	Carbohydrates attached to lipids (glycolipids) and to proteins (glycoproteins) extend from the outward-facing surface of the membrane.
7.5.28	The principal components of a plasma membrane are lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), proteins, and carbohydrates attached to some of the lipids and some of the proteins.
7.5.29	A phospholipid is a molecule consisting of glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate-linked head group.
7.5.30	Cholesterol, another lipid composed of four fused carbon rings, is found alongside the phospholipids in the core of the membrane.
7.5.31	The proportions of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in the plasma membrane vary with cell type, but for a typical human cell, protein accounts for about 50 percent of the composition by mass, lipids (of all types) account for about 40 percent of the composition by mass, with the remaining 10 percent of the composition by mass being carbohydrates.
7.5.32	However, the concentration of proteins and lipids varies with different cell membranes.
7.5.33	For example, myelin, an outgrowth of the membrane of specialized cells that insulates the axons of the peripheral nerves, contains only 18 percent protein and 76 percent lipid.
7.5.34	The mitochondrial inner membrane contains 76 percent protein and only 24 percent lipid.
7.5.35	The plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid.
7.5.36	Carbohydrates are present only on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane and are attached to proteins, forming glycoproteins, or attached to lipids, forming glycolipids.
7.5.37	Phospholipids
7.5.38	The main fabric of the membrane is composed of amphiphilic, phospholipid molecules.
7.5.39	The hydrophilic or “water-loving” areas of these molecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model)
7.5.40	(Figure 5.2) are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell.
7.5.41	Hydrophobic, or water-hating molecules, tend to be non-polar.
7.5.42	They interact with other non-polar molecules in chemical reactions, but generally do not interact with polar molecules.
7.5.43	When placed in water, hydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster.
7.5.44	The hydrophilic regions of the phospholipids tend to form hydrogen bonds with water and other polar molecules on both the exterior and interior of the cell.
7.5.45	Thus, the membrane surfaces that face the interior and exterior of the cell are hydrophilic.
7.5.46	In contrast, the interior of the cell membrane is hydrophobic and will not interact with water.
7.5.47	Therefore, phospholipids form an excellent two-layer cell membrane that separates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside of the cell.
7.5.48	A phospholipid molecule (Figure 5.3) consists of a three-carbon glycerol backbone with two fatty acid molecules attached to carbons 1 and 2, and a phosphate-containing group attached to the third carbon.
7.5.49	This arrangement gives the overall molecule an area described as its head (the phosphate-containing group), which has a polar character or negative charge, and an area called the tail (the fatty acids), which has no charge.
7.5.50	The head can form hydrogen bonds, but the tail cannot.
7.5.51	A molecule with this arrangement of a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged, or non-polar, area is referred to as amphiphilic or “dual-loving.
7.5.52	”
7.5.53	This phospholipid molecule is composed of a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails.
7.5.54	The hydrophilic head group consists of a phosphate-containing group attached to a glycerol molecule.
7.5.55	The hydrophobic tails, each containing either a saturated or an unsaturated fatty acid, are long hydrocarbon chains.
7.5.56	This characteristic is vital to the structure of a plasma membrane because, in water, phospholipids tend to become arranged with their hydrophobic tails facing each other and their hydrophilic heads facing out.
7.5.57	In this way, they form a lipid bilayer—a barrier composed of a double layer of phospholipids that separates the water and other materials on one side of the barrier from the water and other materials on the other side.
7.5.58	In fact, phospholipids heated in an aqueous solution tend to spontaneously form small spheres or droplets (called micelles or liposomes), with their hydrophilic heads forming the exterior and their hydrophobic tails on the inside.
7.5.59	In an aqueous solution, phospholipids tend to arrange themselves with their polar heads facing outward and their hydrophobic tails facing inward.
7.5.60	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal) Proteins Proteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes.
7.5.61	Integral proteins (some specialized types are called integrins) are, as their name suggests, integrated completely into the membrane structure, and their hydrophobic membranespanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the the phospholipid bilayer (Figure 5.2).
7.5.62	Single-pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 20–25 amino acids.
7.5.63	Some span only part of the membrane—associating with a single layer—while others stretch from one side of the membrane to the other, and are exposed on either side.
7.5.64	Some complex proteins are composed of up to 12 segments of a single protein, which are extensively folded and embedded in the membrane (Figure 5.5).
7.5.65	This type of protein has a hydrophilic region or regions, and one or several mildly hydrophobic regions.
7.5.66	This arrangement of regions of the protein tends to orient the protein alongside the phospholipids, with the hydrophobic region of the protein adjacent to the tails of the phospholipids and the hydrophilic region or regions of the protein protruding from the membrane and in contact with the cytosol or extracellular fluid.
7.5.67	Integral membranes proteins may have one or more alpha-helices that span the membrane (examples 1 and 2), or they may have beta-sheets that span the membrane (example 3).
7.5.68	(credit: “Foobar”/Wikimedia Commons)
7.5.69	Chapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes 139 Peripheral proteins are found on the exterior and interior surfaces of membranes, attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipids.
7.5.70	Peripheral proteins, along with integral proteins, may serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for the fibers of the cytoskeleton, or as part of the cell’s recognition sites.
7.5.71	These are sometimes referred to as “cell-specific” proteins.
7.5.72	The body recognizes its own proteins and attacks foreign proteins associated with invasive pathogens.
7.5.73	Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes.
7.5.74	They are always found on the exterior surface of cells and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids)
7.5.75	(Figure 5.2).
7.5.76	These carbohydrate chains may consist of 2–60 monosaccharide units and can be either straight or branched.
7.5.77	Along with peripheral proteins, carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other.
7.5.78	These sites have unique patterns that allow the cell to be recognized, much the way that the facial features unique to each person allow him or her to be recognized.
7.5.79	This recognition function is very important to cells, as it allows the immune system to differentiate between body cells (called “self”) and foreign cells or tissues (called “non-self”).
7.5.80	Similar types of glycoproteins and glycolipids are found on the surfaces of viruses and may change frequently, preventing immune cells from recognizing and attacking them.
7.5.81	These carbohydrates on the exterior surface of the cell—the carbohydrate components of both glycoproteins and glycolipids—are collectively referred to as the glycocalyx (meaning “sugar coating”).
7.5.82	The glycocalyx is highly hydrophilic and attracts large amounts of water to the surface of the cell.
7.5.83	This aids in the interaction of the cell with its watery environment and in the cell’s ability to obtain substances dissolved in the water.
7.5.84	As discussed above, the glycocalyx is also important for cell identification, self/non-self determination, and embryonic development, and is used in cell-cell attachments to form tissues.
7.5.85	Membrane Fluidity
7.5.86	The mosaic characteristic of the membrane, described in the fluid mosaic model, helps to illustrate its nature.
7.5.87	The integral proteins and lipids exist in the membrane as separate but loosely attached molecules.
7.5.88	These resemble the separate, multicolored tiles of a mosaic picture, and they float, moving somewhat with respect to one another.
7.5.89	The membrane is not like a balloon, however, that can expand and contract; rather, it is fairly rigid and can burst if penetrated or if a cell takes in too much water.
7.5.90	However, because of its mosaic nature, a very fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma membrane without causing it to burst, and the membrane will flow and self-seal when the needle is extracted.
7.5.91	The mosaic characteristics of the membrane explain some but not all of its fluidity.
7.5.92	There are two other factors that help maintain this fluid characteristic.
7.5.93	One factor is the nature of the phospholipids themselves.
7.5.94	In their saturated form, the fatty acids in phospholipid tails are saturated with bound hydrogen atoms.
7.5.95	There are no double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms.
7.5.96	This results in tails that are relatively straight.
7.5.97	In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids do not contain a maximal number of hydrogen atoms, but they do contain some double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms; a double bond results in a bend in the string of carbons of approximately 30 degrees (Figure 5.3).
7.5.98	Thus, if saturated fatty acids, with their straight tails, are compressed by decreasing temperatures, they press in on each other, making a dense and fairly rigid membrane.
7.5.99	If unsaturated fatty acids are compressed, the “kinks” in their tails elbow adjacent phospholipid molecules away, maintaining some space between the phospholipid molecules.
7.5.100	This “elbow room” helps to maintain fluidity in the membrane at temperatures at which membranes with saturated fatty acid tails in their phospholipids would “freeze” or solidify.
7.5.101	The relative fluidity of the membrane is particularly important in a cold environment.
7.5.102	A cold environment tends to compress membranes composed largely of saturated fatty acids, making them less fluid and more susceptible to rupturing.
7.5.103	Many organisms (fish are one example) are capable of adapting to cold environments by changing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes in response to the lowering of the temperature.
7.5.104	Animals have an additional membrane constituent that assists in maintaining fluidity.
7.5.105	Cholesterol, which lies alongside the phospholipids in the membrane, tends to dampen the effects of temperature on the membrane.
7.5.106	Thus, this lipid functions as a buffer, preventing lower temperatures from inhibiting fluidity and preventing increased temperatures from increasing fluidity too much.
7.5.107	Thus, cholesterol extends, in both directions, the range of temperature in which the membrane is appropriately fluid and consequently functional.
7.5.108	Cholesterol also serves other functions, such as organizing clusters of transmembrane proteins into lipid rafts.
7.5.109	Plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell, and prevent some harmful materials from entering and some essential materials from leaving.
7.5.110	In other words, plasma membranes are selectively permeable—they allow some substances to pass through, but not others.
7.5.111	If they were to lose this selectivity, the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself, and it would be destroyed.
7.5.112	Some cells require larger amounts of specific substances than do other cells; they must have a way of obtaining these materials from extracellular fluids.
7.5.113	This may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may have special mechanisms that facilitate transport.
7.5.114	Some materials are so important to a cell that it spends some of its energy, hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to obtain these materials.
7.5.115	Red blood cells use some of their energy doing just that.
7.5.116	All cells spend the majority of their energy to maintain an imbalance of sodium and potassium ions between the interior and exterior of the cell.
7.5.117	The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive.
7.5.118	Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement.
7.5.119	In passive transport, substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
7.5.120	A physical space in which there is a range of concentrations of a single substance is said to have a concentration gradient.
7.5.121	Selective Permeability Plasma membranes are asymmetric: the interior of the membrane is not identical to the exterior of the membrane.
7.5.122	In fact, there is a considerable difference between the array of phospholipids and proteins between the two leaflets that form a membrane.
7.5.123	On the interior of the membrane, some proteins serve to anchor the membrane to fibers of the cytoskeleton.
7.5.124	There are peripheral proteins on the exterior of the membrane that bind elements of the extracellular matrix.
7.5.125	Carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also found on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane.
7.5.126	These carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind substances that the cell needs in the extracellular fluid.
7.5.127	This adds considerably to the selective nature of plasma membranes.
7.5.128	The exterior surface of the plasma membrane is not identical to the interior surface of the same membrane.
7.5.129	Recall that plasma membranes are amphiphilic
7.5.130	: They have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.
7.5.131	This characteristic helps the movement of some materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others.
7.5.132	Lipid-soluble material with a low molecular weight can easily slip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane.
7.5.133	Substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins
7.5.134	A, D, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues.
7.5.135	Fat-soluble drugs and hormones also gain easy entry into cells and are readily transported into the body’s tissues and organs.
7.5.136	Molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide have no charge and so pass through membranes by simple diffusion.
7.5.137	Polar substances present problems for the membrane.
7.5.138	While some polar molecules connect easily with the outside of a cell, they cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the plasma membrane.
7.5.139	Additionally, while small ions could easily slip through the spaces in the mosaic of the membrane, their charge prevents them from doing so.
7.5.140	Ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride must have special means of penetrating plasma membranes.
7.5.141	Simple sugars and amino acids also need help with transport across plasma membranes, achieved by various transmembrane proteins (channels).
7.5.142	Diffusion Diffusion is a passive process of transport.
7.5.143	A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space.
7.5.144	You are familiar with diffusion of substances through the air.
7.5.145	For example, think about someone opening a bottle of ammonia in a room filled with people.
7.5.146	The ammonia gas is at its highest concentration in the bottle; its lowest concentration is at the edges of the room.
7.5.147	The ammonia vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the ammonia as it spreads.
7.5.148	Materials move within the cell’s cytosol by diffusion, and certain materials move through the plasma membrane by diffusion (Figure 5.8).
7.5.149	Diffusion expends no energy.
7.5.150	On the contrary, concentration gradients are a form of potential energy, dissipated as the gradient is eliminated.
7.5.151	Diffusion through a permeable membrane moves a substance from an area of high concentration (extracellular fluid, in this case) down its concentration gradient (into the cytoplasm).
7.5.152	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.5.153	Each separate substance in a medium, such as the extracellular fluid, has its own concentration gradient, independent of the concentration gradients of other materials.
7.5.154	In addition, each substance will diffuse according to that gradient.
7.5.155	Within a system, there will be different rates of diffusion of the different substances in the medium.
7.5.156	Factors That Affect Diffusion Molecules move constantly in a random manner, at a rate that depends on their mass, their environment, and the amount of thermal energy they possess, which in turn is a function of temperature.
7.5.157	This movement accounts for the diffusion of molecules through whatever medium in which they are localized.
7.5.158	A substance will tend to move into any space available to it until it is evenly distributed throughout it.
7.5.159	After a substance has diffused completely through a space, removing its concentration gradient, molecules will still move around in the space, but there will be no net movement of the number of molecules from one area to another.
7.5.160	This lack of a concentration gradient in which there is no net movement of a substance is known as dynamic equilibrium.
7.5.161	While diffusion will go forward in the presence of a concentration gradient of a substance, several factors affect the rate of diffusion.
7.5.162	•
7.5.163	Extent of the concentration gradient: The greater the difference in concentration, the more rapid the diffusion.
7.5.164	The closer the distribution of the material gets to equilibrium, the slower the rate of diffusion becomes.
7.5.165	•
7.5.166	Mass of the molecules diffusing
7.5.167	: Heavier molecules move more slowly; therefore, they diffuse more slowly.
7.5.168	The reverse is true for lighter molecules.
7.5.169	•
7.5.170	Temperature: Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the movement of the molecules, increasing the rate of diffusion.
7.5.171	Lower temperatures decrease the energy of the molecules, thus decreasing the rate of diffusion.
7.5.172	• Solvent density: As the density of a solvent increases, the rate of diffusion decreases.
7.5.173	The molecules slow down because they have a more difficult time getting through the denser medium.
7.5.174	If the medium is less dense, diffusion increases.
7.5.175	Because cells primarily use diffusion to move materials within the cytoplasm, any increase in the cytoplasm’s density will inhibit the movement of the materials.
7.5.176	An example of this is a person experiencing dehydration.
7.5.177	As the body’s cells lose water, the rate of diffusion decreases in the cytoplasm, and the cells’ functions deteriorate.
7.5.178	Neurons tend to be very sensitive to this effect.
7.5.179	Dehydration frequently leads to unconsciousness and possibly coma because of the decrease in diffusion rate within the cells.
7.5.180	•
7.5.181	Solubility: As discussed earlier, nonpolar or lipid-soluble materials pass through plasma membranes more easily than polar materials, allowing a faster rate of diffusion.
7.5.182	•
7.5.183	Surface area and thickness of the plasma membrane: Increased surface area increases the rate of diffusion, whereas a thicker membrane reduces it.
7.5.184	•
7.5.185	Distance travelled: The greater the distance that a substance must travel, the slower the rate of diffusion.
7.5.186	This places an upper limitation on cell size.
7.5.187	A large, spherical cell will die because nutrients or waste cannot reach or leave the center of the cell, respectively.
7.5.188	Therefore, cells must either be small in size, as in the case of many prokaryotes, or be flattened, as with many single-celled eukaryotes.
7.5.189	A variation of diffusion is the process of filtration.
7.5.190	In filtration, material moves according to its concentration gradient through a membrane; sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure, causing the substances to filter more rapidly.
7.5.191	This occurs in the kidney, where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances, or solutes, out of the blood and into the renal tubules.
7.5.192	The rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure.
7.5.193	One of the effects of high blood pressure is the appearance of protein in the urine, which is “squeezed through” by the abnormally high pressure.
7.5.194	Facilitated transport
7.5.195	In facilitated transport, also called facilitated diffusion, materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane proteins.
7.5.196	A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without expending cellular energy.
7.5.197	However, these materials are ions are polar molecules that are repelled by the hydrophobic parts of the cell membrane.
7.5.198	Facilitated transport proteins shield these materials from the repulsive force of the membrane, allowing them to diffuse into the cell.
7.5.199	The material being transported is first attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane.
7.5.200	This allows the material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular fluid.
7.5.201	The substances are then passed to specific integral proteins that facilitate their passage.
7.5.202	Some of these integral proteins are collections of beta pleated sheets that form a pore or channel through the phospholipid bilayer.
7.5.203	Others are carrier proteins which bind with the substance and aid its diffusion through the membrane.
7.5.204	Channels
7.5.205	The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins, and they function as either channels for the material or carriers.
7.5.206	In both cases, they are transmembrane proteins.
7.5.207	Channels are specific for the substance that is being transported.
7.5.208	Channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids; they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers (Figure 5.9).
7.5.209	Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell.
7.5.210	Aquaporins are channel proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very high rate.
7.5.211	Facilitated transport moves substances down their concentration gradients.
7.5.212	They may cross the plasma membrane with the aid of channel proteins.
7.5.213	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.5.214	Channel proteins are either open at all times or they are “gated,” which controls the opening of the channel.
7.5.215	The attachment of a particular ion to the channel protein may control the opening, or other mechanisms or substances may be involved.
7.5.216	In some tissues, sodium and chloride ions pass freely through open channels, whereas in other tissues a gate must be opened to allow passage.
7.5.217	An example of this occurs in the kidney, where both forms of channels are found in different parts of the renal tubules.
7.5.218	Cells involved in the transmission of electrical impulses, such as nerve and muscle cells, have gated channels for sodium, potassium, and calcium in their membranes.
7.5.219	Opening and closing of these channels changes the relative concentrations on opposing sides of the membrane of these ions, resulting in the facilitation of electrical transmission along membranes (in the case of nerve cells) or in muscle contraction (in the case of muscle cells).
7.5.220	Carrier Proteins Another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein.
7.5.221	This aptly named protein binds a substance and, in doing so, triggers a change of its own shape, moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior (Figure 5.10); depending on the gradient, the material may move in the opposite direction.
7.5.222	Carrier proteins are typically specific for a single substance.
7.5.223	This selectivity adds to the overall selectivity of the plasma membrane.
7.5.224	The exact mechanism for the change of shape is poorly understood.
7.5.225	Proteins can change shape when their hydrogen bonds are affected, but this may not fully explain this mechanism.
7.5.226	Each carrier protein is specific to one substance, and there are a finite number of these proteins in any membrane.
7.5.227	This can cause problems in transporting enough of the material for the cell to function properly.
7.5.228	When all of the proteins are bound to their ligands, they are saturated and the rate of transport is at its maximum.
7.5.229	Increasing the concentration gradient at this point will not result in an increased rate of transport.
7.5.230	Some substances are able to move down their concentration gradient across the plasma membrane with the aid of carrier proteins.
7.5.231	Carrier proteins change shape as they move molecules across the membrane.
7.5.232	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.5.233	An example of this process occurs in the kidney.
7.5.234	Glucose, water, salts, ions, and amino acids needed by the body are filtered in one part of the kidney.
7.5.235	This filtrate, which includes glucose, is then reabsorbed in another part of the kidney.
7.5.236	Because there are only a finite number of carrier proteins for glucose, if more glucose is present than the proteins can handle, the excess is not transported and it is excreted from the body in the urine.
7.5.237	In a diabetic individual, this is described as “spilling glucose into the urine.
7.5.238	”
7.5.239	A different group of carrier proteins called glucose transport proteins, or GLUTs, are involved in transporting glucose and other hexose sugars through plasma membranes within the body.
7.5.240	Channel and carrier proteins transport material at different rates.
7.5.241	Channel proteins transport much more quickly than do carrier proteins.
7.5.242	Channel proteins facilitate diffusion at a rate of tens of millions of molecules per second, whereas carrier proteins work at a rate of a thousand to a million molecules per second.
7.5.243	Osmosis Osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes.
7.5.244	While diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells, osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water.
7.5.245	Not surprisingly, the aquaporins that facilitate water movement play a large role in osmosis, most prominently in red blood cells and the membranes of kidney tubules.
7.5.246	Mechanism Osmosis is a special case of diffusion.
7.5.247	Water, like other substances, moves from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration.
7.5.248	An obvious question is what makes water move at all?
7.5.249	Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane separating the two sides or halves (Figure 5.11).
7.5.250	On both sides of the membrane the water level is the same, but there are different concentrations of a dissolved substance, or solute, that cannot cross the membrane (otherwise the concentrations on each side would be balanced by the solute crossing the membrane).
7.5.251	If the volume of the solution on both sides of the membrane is the same, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are different amounts of water, the solvent, on either side of the membrane.
7.5.252	In osmosis, water always moves from an area of higher water concentration to one of lower concentration.
7.5.253	In the diagram shown, the solute cannot pass through the selectively permeable membrane, but the water can.
7.5.254	To illustrate this, imagine two full glasses of water.
7.5.255	One has a single teaspoon of sugar in it, whereas the second one contains one-quarter cup of sugar.
7.5.256	If the total volume of the solutions in both cups is the same, which cup contains more water?
7.5.257	Because the large amount of sugar in the second cup takes up much more space than the teaspoon of sugar in the first cup, the first cup has more water in it.
7.5.258	Returning to the beaker example, recall that it has a mixture of solutes on either side of the membrane.
7.5.259	A principle of diffusion is that the molecules move around and will spread evenly throughout the medium if they can.
7.5.260	However, only the material capable of getting through the membrane will diffuse through it.
7.5.261	In this example, the solute cannot diffuse through the membrane, but the water can.
7.5.262	Water has a concentration gradient in this system.
7.5.263	Thus, water will diffuse down its concentration gradient, crossing the membrane to the side where it is less concentrated.
7.5.264	This diffusion of water through the membrane—osmosis—will continue until the concentration gradient of water goes to zero or until the hydrostatic pressure of the water balances the osmotic pressure.
7.5.265	Osmosis proceeds constantly in living systems.
7.5.266	Tonicity Tonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis.
7.5.267	A solution's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution.
7.5.268	Osmolarity describes the total solute concentration of the solution.
7.5.269	A solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles; a solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles.
7.5.270	In a situation in which solutions of two different osmolarities are separated by a membrane permeable to water, though not to the solute, water will move from the side of the membrane with lower osmolarity (and more water) to the side with higher osmolarity (and less water).
7.5.271	This effect makes sense if you remember that the solute cannot move across the membrane, and thus the only component in the system that can move—the water—moves along its own concentration gradient.
7.5.272	An important distinction that concerns living systems is that osmolarity measures the number of particles (which may be molecules) in a solution.
7.5.273	Therefore, a solution that is cloudy with cells may have a lower osmolarity than a solution that is clear, if the second solution contains more dissolved molecules than there are cells.
7.5.274	Hypotonic Solutions
7.5.275	Three terms—hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic—are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the cells.
7.5.276	In a hypotonic situation, the extracellular fluid has lower osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell.
7.5.277	(In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the prefix hypo- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than the cell cytoplasm.)
7.5.278	It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water in the solution than does the cell.
7.5.279	In this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell.
7.5.280	Hypertonic Solutions
7.5.281	As for a hypertonic solution, the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell’s cytoplasm; therefore, the fluid contains less water than the cell does.
7.5.282	Because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water, water will leave the cell.
7.5.283	Isotonic Solutions
7.5.284	In an isotonic solution, the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell.
7.5.285	If the osmolarity of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid, there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell, although water will still move in and out.
7.5.286	Blood cells and plant cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic appearances.
7.5.287	Tonicity in Living Systems
7.5.288	In a hypotonic environment, water enters a cell, and the cell swells.
7.5.289	In an isotonic condition, the relative concentrations of solute and solvent are equal on both sides of the membrane.
7.5.290	There is no net water movement; therefore, there is no change in the size of the cell.
7.5.291	In a hypertonic solution, water leaves a cell and the cell shrinks.
7.5.292	If either the hypo- or hyper- condition goes to excess, the cell’s functions become compromised, and the cell may be destroyed.
7.5.293	A red blood cell will burst, or lyse, when it swells beyond the plasma membrane’s capability to expand.
7.5.294	Remember, the membrane resembles a mosaic, with discrete spaces between the molecules composing it.
7.5.295	If the cell swells, and the spaces between the lipids and proteins become too large, the cell will break apart.
7.5.296	In contrast, when excessive amounts of water leave a red blood cell, the cell shrinks, or crenates.
7.5.297	This has the effect of concentrating the solutes left in the cell, making the cytosol denser and interfering with diffusion within the cell.
7.5.298	The cell’s ability to function will be compromised and may also result in the death of the cell.
7.5.299	Various living things have ways of controlling the effects of osmosis—a mechanism called osmoregulation.
7.5.300	Some organisms, such as plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, have cell walls that surround the plasma membrane and prevent cell lysis in a hypotonic solution.
7.5.301	The plasma membrane can only expand to the limit of the cell wall, so the cell will not lyse.
7.5.302	In fact, the cytoplasm in plants is always slightly hypertonic to the cellular environment, and water will always enter a cell if water is available.
7.5.303	This inflow of water produces turgor pressure, which stiffens the cell walls of the plant (Figure 5.13).
7.5.304	In nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports the plant.
7.5.305	Conversly, if the plant is not watered, the extracellular fluid will become hypertonic, causing water to leave the cell.
7.5.306	In this condition, the cell does not shrink because the cell wall is not flexible.
7.5.307	However, the cell membrane detaches from the wall and constricts the cytoplasm.
7.5.308	This is called plasmolysis.
7.5.309	Plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt (Figure 5.14).
7.5.310	The turgor pressure within a plant cell depends on the tonicity of the solution that it is bathed in.
7.5.311	Without adequate water, the plant on the left has lost turgor pressure, visible in its wilting; the turgor pressure is restored by watering it (right).
7.5.312	(credit: Victor M. Vicente Selvas)
7.5.313	Tonicity is a concern for all living things.
7.5.314	For example, paramecia and amoebas, which are protists that lack cell walls, have contractile vacuoles.
7.5.315	This vesicle collects excess water from the cell and pumps it out, keeping the cell from lysing as it takes on water from its environment.
7.5.316	A paramecium’s contractile vacuole, here visualized using bright field light microscopy at 480x magnification, continuously pumps water out of the organism’s body to keep it from bursting in a hypotonic medium.
7.5.317	(credit: modification of work by NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.5.318	Many marine invertebrates have internal salt levels matched to their environments, making them isotonic with the water in which they live.
7.5.319	Fish, however, must spend approximately five percent of their metabolic energy maintaining osmotic homeostasis.
7.5.320	Freshwater fish live in an environment that is hypotonic to their cells.
7.5.321	These fish actively take in salt through their gills and excrete diluted urine to rid themselves of excess water.
7.5.322	Saltwater fish live in the reverse environment, which is hypertonic to their cells, and they secrete salt through their gills and excrete highly concentrated urine.
7.5.323	In vertebrates, the kidneys regulate the amount of water in the body.
7.5.324	Osmoreceptors are specialized cells in the brain that monitor the concentration of solutes in the blood.
7.5.325	If the levels of solutes increase beyond a certain range, a hormone is released that retards water loss through the kidney and dilutes the blood to safer levels.
7.5.326	Animals also have high concentrations of albumin, which is produced by the liver, in their blood.
7.5.327	This protein is too large to pass easily through plasma membranes and is a major factor in controlling the osmotic pressures applied to tissues.
7.5.328	Active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell’s energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
7.5.329	If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient—that is, if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid (and vice versa)—the cell must use energy to move the substance.
7.5.330	Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight materials, such as ions, through the membrane.
7.5.331	Other mechanisms transport much larger molecules.
7.5.332	Electrochemical Gradient
7.5.333	We have discussed simple concentration gradients
7.5.334	—differential concentrations of a substance across a space or a membrane—
7.5.335	but in living systems, gradients are more complex.
7.5.336	Because ions move into and out of cells and because cells contain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an electrical gradient, a difference of charge, across the plasma membrane.
7.5.337	The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K+) and lower concentrations of sodium (Na+) than does the extracellular fluid.
7.5.338	So in a living cell, the concentration gradient of Na+ tends to drive it into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na+ (a positive ion) also tends to drive it inward to the negatively charged interior.
7.5.339	The situation is more complex, however, for other elements such as potassium.
7.5.340	The electrical gradient of K+, a positive ion, also tends to drive it into the cell, but the concentration gradient of K+ tends to drive K+ out of the cell (Figure 5.16).
7.5.341	The combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its electrochemical gradient.
7.5.342	Moving Against a Gradient To move substances against a concentration or electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy.
7.5.343	This energy is harvested from ATP generated through the cell’s metabolism.
7.5.344	Active transport mechanisms, collectively called pumps, work against electrochemical gradients.
7.5.345	Small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes.
7.5.346	Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other substances needed by living cells in the face of these passive movements.
7.5.347	Much of a cell’s supply of metabolic energy may be spent maintaining these processes.
7.5.348	(Most of a red blood cell’s metabolic energy is used to maintain the imbalance between exterior and interior sodium and potassium levels required by the cell.)
7.5.349	Because active transport mechanisms depend on a cell’s metabolism for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the supply of ATP.
7.5.350	Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and small molecules.
7.5.351	Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane, which is directly dependent on ATP.
7.5.352	Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP.
7.5.353	Carrier Proteins for Active Transport
7.5.354	An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement: there are three types of these proteins or transporters (Figure 5.17).
7.5.355	A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule.
7.5.356	A symporter carries two different ions or molecules, both in the same direction.
7.5.357	An antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules, but in different directions.
7.5.358	All of these transporters can also transport small, uncharged organic molecules like glucose.
7.5.359	These three types of carrier proteins are also found in facilitated diffusion, but they do not require ATP to work in that process.
7.5.360	Some examples of pumps for active transport are Na+-K+ ATPase, which carries sodium and potassium ions, and H+-K+ ATPase, which carries hydrogen and potassium ions.
7.5.361	Both of these are antiporter carrier proteins.
7.5.362	Two other carrier proteins are Ca2+ ATPase and H+ ATPase, which carry only calcium and only hydrogen ions, respectively.
7.5.363	Both are pumps.
7.5.364	A uniporter carries one molecule or ion.
7.5.365	A symporter carries two different molecules or ions, both in the same direction.
7.5.366	An antiporter also carries two different molecules or ions, but in different directions.

7.5.368	Primary Active Transport
7.5.369	The primary active transport that functions with the active transport of sodium and potassium allows secondary active transport to occur.
7.5.370	The second transport method is still considered active because it depends on the use of energy as does primary transport (Figure 5.18).
7.5.371	Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient (electrogenic transport).
7.5.372	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.5.373	One of the most important pumps in animals cells is the sodium-potassium pump (Na+-K+ ATPase), which maintains the electrochemical gradient (and the correct concentrations of Na+ and K+) in living cells.
7.5.374	The sodium-potassium pump moves K+ into the cell while moving Na+ out at the same time, at a ratio of three Na+ for every two K+ ions moved in.
7.5.375	The Na+- K+ ATPase exists in two forms, depending on its orientation to the interior or exterior of the cell and its affinity for either sodium or potassium ions.
7.5.376	The process consists of the following six steps.
7.5.377	1.
7.5.378	With the enzyme oriented towards the interior of the cell, the carrier has a high affinity for sodium ions.
7.5.379	Three ions bind to the protein.
7.5.380	2.
7.5.381	ATP is hydrolyzed by the protein carrier and a low-energy phosphate group attaches to it.
7.5.382	3.
7.5.383	As a result, the carrier changes shape and re-orients itself towards the exterior of the membrane.
7.5.384	The protein’s affinity for sodium decreases and the three sodium ions leave the carrier.
7.5.385	4.
7.5.386	The shape change increases the carrier’s affinity for potassium ions, and two such ions attach to the protein.
7.5.387	Subsequently, the low-energy phosphate group detaches from the carrier.
7.5.388	5.
7.5.389	With the phosphate group removed and potassium ions attached, the carrier protein repositions itself towards the interior of the cell.
7.5.390	The carrier protein, in its new configuration, has a decreased affinity for potassium, and the two ions are released into the cytoplasm.
7.5.391	The protein now has a higher affinity for sodium ions, and the process starts again.
7.5.392	Several things have happened as a result of this process.
7.5.393	At this point, there are more sodium ions outside of the cell than inside and more potassium ions inside than out.
7.5.394	For every three ions of sodium that move out, two ions of potassium move in.
7.5.395	This results in the interior being slightly more negative relative to the exterior.
7.5.396	This difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process.
7.5.397	The sodium-potassium pump is, therefore, an electrogenic pump (a pump that creates a charge imbalance), creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential.
7.5.398	Secondary Active Transport (Co-transport)
7.5.399	Secondary active transport brings sodium ions, and possibly other compounds, into the cell.
7.5.400	As sodium ion concentrations build outside of the plasma membrane because of the action of the primary active transport process, an electrochemical gradient is created.
7.5.401	If a channel protein exists and is open, the sodium ions will be pulled through the membrane.
7.5.402	This movement is used to transport other substances that can attach themselves to the transport protein through the membrane (Figure 5.19).
7.5.403	Many amino acids, as well as glucose, enter a cell this way.
7.5.404	This secondary process is also used to store high-energy hydrogen ions in the mitochondria of plant and animal cells for the production of ATP.
7.5.405	The potential energy that accumulates in the stored hydrogen ions is translated into kinetic energy as the ions surge through the channel protein ATP synthase, and that energy is used to convert ADP into ATP.
7.5.406	In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger molecules and particles (see Table 5.2 for examples).
7.5.407	Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms.
7.5.408	You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy.
7.5.409	A large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell.
7.5.410	Endocytosis Endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells, into a cell.
7.5.411	There are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: The plasma membrane of the cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle.
7.5.412	The pocket pinches off, resulting in the particle being contained in a newly created intracellular vesicle formed from the plasma membrane.
7.5.413	Phagocytosis Phagocytosis (the condition of “cell eating”) is the process by which large particles, such as cells or relatively large particles, are taken in by a cell.
7.5.414	For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (Figure 5.20).
7.5.415	In phagocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds the particle and engulfs it.
7.5.416	(credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.5.417	In preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the inward-facing surface of the plasma membrane becomes coated with a protein called clathrin, which stabilizes this section of the membrane.
7.5.418	The coated portion of the membrane then extends from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it.
7.5.419	Once the vesicle containing the particle is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for the breakdown of the material in the newly formed compartment (endosome).
7.5.420	When accessible nutrients from the degradation of the vesicular contents have been extracted, the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid.
7.5.421	The endosomal membrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane.
7.5.422	Pinocytosis A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis.
7.5.423	This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid.
7.5.424	In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules, including water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid.
7.5.425	Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome.
7.5.426	In pinocytosis, the cell membrane invaginates, surrounds a small volume of fluid, and pinches off.
7.5.427	(credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.5.428	A variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis.
7.5.429	This process uses a coating protein, called caveolin, on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which performs a similar function to clathrin.
7.5.430	The cavities in the plasma membrane that form the vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin.
7.5.431	The vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae (singular caveola) are smaller than those in pinocytosis.
7.5.432	Potocytosis is used to bring small molecules into the cell and to transport these molecules through the cell for their release on the other side of the cell, a process called transcytosis.
7.5.433	Receptor-mediated Endocytosis A targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific binding affinity for certain substances.
7.5.434	In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targeted to a single type of substance that binds to the receptor on the external surface of the cell membrane.
7.5.435	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.5.436	In receptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane.
7.5.437	If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood.
7.5.438	Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration.
7.5.439	Some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis.
7.5.440	For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
7.5.441	In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely.
7.5.442	People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear LDL particles from their blood.
7.5.443	Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site.
7.5.444	Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin all have sites that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells.
7.5.445	Exocytosis
7.5.446	The reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis.
7.5.447	Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid.
7.5.448	Waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane.
7.5.449	This fusion opens the membranous envelope on 158 Chapter 5 | Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes
7.5.450	This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11448/1.10 the exterior of the cell, and the waste material is expelled into the extracellular space (Figure 5.23).
7.5.451	Other examples of cells releasing molecules via exocytosis include the secretion of proteins of the extracellular matrix and secretion of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft by synaptic vesicles.
7.6.0	Introduction
7.6.1	Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy.
7.6.2	Energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use a great deal of energy while thinking, and even during sleep.
7.6.3	In fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy.
7.6.4	Nutrients and other molecules are imported, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into new molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and may be distributed to the entire organism.
7.6.5	For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are actively built from smaller molecules.
7.6.6	Complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy.
7.6.7	Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required for both the synthesis and breakdown of molecules.
7.6.8	Additionally, signaling molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters are transported between cells.
7.6.9	Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are ingested and broken down by cells.
7.6.10	Cells must also export waste and toxins to stay healthy, and many cells must swim or move surrounding materials via the beating motion of cellular appendages like cilia and flagella.
7.6.11	The cellular processes listed above require a steady supply of energy.
7.6.12	From where, and in what form, does this energy come?
7.6.13	How do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it?
7.6.14	This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer.
7.6.15	This chapter will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell are performed with great efficiency.
7.6.16	Scientists use the term bioenergetics to discuss the concept of energy flow (Figure 6.2) through living systems, such as cells.
7.6.17	Cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of complex molecules occur through stepwise chemical reactions.
7.6.18	Some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release energy, whereas others require energy to proceed.
7.6.19	Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what has been used, cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy-requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place.
7.6.20	All of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells, including those that use energy and those that release energy, are the cell’s metabolism.
7.6.21	Most life forms on earth get their energy from the sun.
7.6.22	Plants use photosynthesis to capture sunlight, and herbivores eat those plants to obtain energy.
7.6.23	Carnivores eat the herbivores, and decomposers digest plant and animal matter.
7.6.24	During the chemical reactions of photosynthesis, energy is provided in the form of a very high-energy molecule called ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, which is the primary energy currency of all cells.
7.6.25	Just as the dollar is used as currency to buy goods, cells use molecules of ATP as energy currency to perform immediate work.
7.6.26	The sugar (glucose) is stored as starch or glycogen.
7.6.27	Energy-storing polymers like these are broken down into glucose to supply molecules of ATP.
7.6.28	Solar energy is required to synthesize a molecule of glucose during the reactions of photosynthesis.
7.6.29	In photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is initially transformed into chemical energy that is temporally stored in the energy carrier molecules ATP and NADPH
7.6.30	(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).
7.6.31	The stored energy in ATP and NADPH is then used later in photosynthesis to build one molecule of glucose from six molecules of CO2.
7.6.32	This process is analogous to eating breakfast in the morning to acquire energy for your body that can be used later in the day.
7.6.33	Under ideal conditions, energy from 18 molecules of ATP is required to synthesize one molecule of glucose during the reactions of photosynthesis.
7.6.34	Glucose molecules can also be combined with and converted into other types of sugars.
7.6.35	When sugars are consumed, molecules of glucose eventually make their way into each living cell of the organism.
7.6.36	Inside the cell, each sugar molecule is broken down through a complex series of chemical reactions.
7.6.37	The goal of these reactions is to harvest the energy stored inside the sugar molecules.
7.6.38	The harvested energy is used to make high-energy ATP molecules, which can be used to perform work, powering many chemical reactions in the cell.
7.6.39	The amount of energy needed to make one molecule of glucose from six molecules of carbon dioxide is 18 molecules of ATP and 12 molecules of NADPH (each one of which is energetically equivalent to three molecules of ATP), or a total of 54 molecule equivalents required for the synthesis of one molecule of glucose.
7.6.40	This process is a fundamental and efficient way for cells to generate the molecular energy that they require.
7.6.41	Plants, like this oak tree and acorn, use energy from sunlight to make sugar and other organic molecules.
7.6.42	Both plants and animals (like this squirrel) use cellular respiration to derive energy from the organic molecules originally produced by plants.
7.6.43	Metabolic Pathways
7.6.44	The processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two types of metabolic pathways.
7.6.45	A metabolic pathway is a series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule or molecules, step-by-step, through a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product or products.
7.6.46	In the case of sugar metabolism, the first metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down into smaller molecules.
7.6.47	These two opposite processes—the first requiring energy and the second producing energy—are referred to as anabolic (building) and catabolic (breaking down) pathways, respectively.
7.6.48	Consequently, metabolism is composed of building (anabolism) and degradation (catabolism).
7.6.49	There is more to the complexity of metabolism than understanding the metabolic pathways alone.
7.6.50	Metabolic complexity varies from organism to organism.
7.6.51	Photosynthesis is the primary pathway in which photosynthetic organisms like plants (the majority of global synthesis is done by planktonic algae) harvest the sun’s energy and convert it into carbohydrates.
7.6.52	The by-product of photosynthesis is oxygen, required by some cells to carry out cellular respiration.
7.6.53	During cellular respiration, oxygen aids in the catabolic breakdown of carbon compounds, like carbohydrates.
7.6.54	Among the products of this catabolism are CO2 and ATP.
7.6.55	In addition, some eukaryotes perform catabolic processes without oxygen (fermentation); that is, they perform or use anaerobic metabolism.
7.6.56	Organisms probably evolved anaerobic metabolism to survive (living organisms came into existence about 3.8 billion years ago, when the atmosphere lacked oxygen).
7.6.57	Despite the differences between organisms and the complexity of metabolism, researchers have found that all branches of life share some of the same metabolic pathways, suggesting that all organisms evolved from the same ancient common ancestor (Figure 6.4).
7.6.58	Evidence indicates that over time, the pathways diverged, adding specialized enzymes to allow organisms to better adapt to their environment, thus increasing their chance to survive.
7.6.59	However, the underlying principle remains that all organisms must harvest energy from their environment and convert it to ATP to carry out cellular functions.
7.6.60	Anabolic and Catabolic Pathways Anabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones.
7.6.61	Synthesizing sugar from CO2 is one example.
7.6.62	Other examples are the synthesis of large proteins from amino acid building blocks, and the synthesis of new DNA strands from nucleic acid building blocks.
7.6.63	These biosynthetic processes are critical to the life of the cell, take place constantly, and demand energy provided by ATP and other high-energy molecules like NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH (Figure 6.5).
7.6.64	ATP is an important molecule for cells to have in sufficient supply at all times.
7.6.65	The breakdown of sugars illustrates how a single molecule of glucose can store enough energy to make a great deal of ATP, 36 to 38 molecules.
7.6.66	This is a catabolic pathway.
7.6.67	Catabolic pathways involve the degradation (or breakdown) of complex molecules into simpler ones.
7.6.68	Molecular energy stored in the bonds of complex molecules is released in catabolic pathways and harvested in such a way that it can be used to produce ATP.
7.6.69	Other energy-storing molecules, such as fats, are also broken down through similar catabolic reactions to release energy and make ATP (Figure 6.5).
7.6.70	It is important to know that the chemical reactions of metabolic pathways don’t take place spontaneously.
7.6.71	Each reaction step is facilitated, or catalyzed, by a protein called an enzyme.
7.6.72	Enzymes are important for catalyzing all types of biological reactions—those that require energy as well as those that release energy.
7.6.73	Anabolic pathways are those that require energy to synthesize larger molecules.
7.6.74	Catabolic pathways are those that generate energy by breaking down larger molecules.
7.6.75	Both types of pathways are required for maintaining the cell’s energy balance.
7.6.76	Energy is defined as the ability to do work.
7.6.77	As you’ve learned, energy exists in different forms.
7.6.78	For example, electrical energy, light energy, and heat energy are all different types of energy.
7.6.79	While these are all familiar types of energy that one can see or feel, there is another type of energy that is much less tangible.
7.6.80	This energy is associated with something as simple as an object held above the ground.
7.6.81	In order to appreciate the way energy flows into and out of biological systems, it is important to understand more about the different types of energy that exist in the physical world.
7.6.82	Types of Energy
7.6.83	When an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object.
7.6.84	In the example of an airplane in flight, there is a great deal of energy associated with the motion of the airplane.
7.6.85	This is because moving objects are capable of enacting a change, or doing work.
7.6.86	Think of a wrecking ball.
7.6.87	Even a slow-moving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other objects.
7.6.88	However, a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work.
7.6.89	Energy associated with objects in motion is called kinetic energy.
7.6.90	A speeding bullet, a walking person, the rapid movement of molecules in the air (which produces heat), and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy.
7.6.91	Now what if that same motionless wrecking ball is lifted two stories above a car with a crane?
7.6.92	If the suspended wrecking ball is unmoving, is there energy associated with it?
7.6.93	The answer is yes.
7.6.94	The suspended wrecking ball has energy associated with it that is fundamentally different from the kinetic energy of objects in motion.
7.6.95	This form of energy results from the fact that there is the potential for the wrecking ball to do work.
7.6.96	If it is released, indeed it would do work.
7.6.97	Because this type of energy refers to the potential to do work, it is called potential energy.
7.6.98	Objects transfer their energy between kinetic and potential in the following way: As the wrecking ball hangs motionless, it has 0 kinetic and 100 percent potential energy.
7.6.99	Once it is released, its kinetic energy begins to increase because it builds speed due to gravity.
7.6.100	At the same time, as it nears the ground, it loses potential energy.
7.6.101	Somewhere mid-fall it has 50 percent kinetic and 50 percent potential energy.
7.6.102	Just before it hits the ground, the ball has nearly lost its potential energy and has near-maximal kinetic energy.
7.6.103	Other examples of potential energy include the energy of water held behind a dam (Figure 6.6), or a person about to skydive out of an airplane.
7.6.104	Water behind a dam has potential energy.
7.6.105	Moving water, such as in a waterfall or a rapidly flowing river, has kinetic energy.
7.6.106	Potential energy is not only associated with the location of matter (such as a child sitting on a tree branch), but also with the structure of matter.
7.6.107	A spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed; so does a rubber band that is pulled taut.
7.6.108	The very existence of living cells relies heavily on structural potential energy.
7.6.109	On a chemical level, the bonds that hold the atoms of molecules together have potential energy.
7.6.110	Remember that anabolic cellular pathways require energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones, and catabolic pathways release energy when complex molecules are broken down.
7.6.111	The fact that energy can be released by the breakdown of certain chemical bonds implies that those bonds have potential energy.
7.6.112	In fact, there is potential energy stored within the bonds of all the food molecules we eat, which is eventually harnessed for use.
7.6.113	This is because these bonds can release energy when broken.
7.6.114	The type of potential energy that exists within chemical bonds, and is released when those bonds are broken, is called chemical energy (Figure 6.7).
7.6.115	Chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food.
7.6.116	The release of energy is brought about by breaking the molecular bonds within fuel molecules.
7.6.117	The molecules in gasoline (octane, the chemical formula shown) contain chemical energy within the chemical bonds.
7.6.118	This energy is transformed into kinetic energy that allows a car to race on a racetrack.
7.6.119	Free Energy
7.6.120	After learning that chemical reactions release energy when energy-storing bonds are broken, an important next question is how is the energy associated with chemical reactions quantified and expressed?
7.6.121	How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction?
7.6.122	A measurement of free energy is used to quantitate these energy transfers.
7.6.123	Free energy is called Gibbs free energy (abbreviated with the letter G) after Josiah Willard Gibbs, the scientist who developed the measurement.
7.6.124	Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve the loss of some amount of energy in an unusable form such as heat, resulting in entropy.
7.6.125	Gibbs free energy specifically refers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that is available after entropy is accounted for.
7.6.126	In other words, Gibbs free energy is usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.
7.6.127	Every chemical reaction involves a change in free energy, called delta G (ΔG).
7.6.128	The change in free energy can be calculated for any system that undergoes such a change, such as a chemical reaction.
7.6.129	To calculate ΔG, subtract the amount of energy lost to entropy (denoted as ΔS) from the total energy change of the system.
7.6.130	This total energy change in the system is called enthalpy and is denoted as ΔH .
7.6.131	The formula for calculating ΔG is as follows, where the symbol T refers to absolute temperature in Kelvin (degrees Celsius + 273): ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
7.6.132	The standard free energy change of a chemical reaction is expressed as an amount of energy per mole of the reaction product (either in kilojoules or kilocalories, kJ/mol or kcal/mol; 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal) under standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions.
7.6.133	Standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions are generally calculated at pH 7.0 in biological systems, 25 degrees Celsius, and 100 kilopascals (1 atm pressure), respectively.
7.6.134	It is important to note that cellular conditions vary considerably from these standard conditions, and so standard calculated ΔG values for biological reactions will be different inside the cell.
7.6.135	Endergonic Reactions and Exergonic Reactions
7.6.136	If energy is released during a chemical reaction, then the resulting value from the above equation will be a negative number.
7.6.137	In other words, reactions that release energy have a ΔG < 0.
7.6.138	A negative ΔG also means that the products of the reaction have less free energy than the reactants, because they gave off some free energy during the reaction.
7.6.139	Reactions that have a negative ΔG and consequently release free energy are called exergonic reactions.
7.6.140	Think: exergonic means energy is exiting the system.
7.6.141	These reactions are also referred to as spontaneous reactions, because they can occur without the addition of energy into the system.
7.6.142	Understanding which chemical reactions are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful for biologists, because these reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell.
7.6.143	An important distinction must be drawn between the term spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately.
7.6.144	Contrary to the everyday use of the term, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs.
7.6.145	The rusting of iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that occurs slowly, little by little, over time.
7.6.146	If a chemical reaction requires an input of energy rather than releasing energy, then the ΔG for that reaction will be a positive value.
7.6.147	In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants.
7.6.148	Thus, the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy-storing molecules.
7.6.149	These chemical reactions are called endergonic reactions, and they are nonspontaneous.
7.6.150	An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy.
7.6.151	Let’s revisit the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule, glucose.
7.6.152	Remember that the building of complex molecules, such as sugars, from simpler ones is an anabolic process and requires energy.
7.6.153	Therefore, the chemical reactions involved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions.
7.6.154	On the other hand, the catabolic process of breaking sugar down into simpler molecules releases energy in a series of exergonic reactions.
7.6.155	Like the example of rust above, the breakdown of sugar involves spontaneous reactions, but these reactions don’t occur instantaneously.
7.6.156	Figure 6.8 shows some other examples of endergonic and exergonic reactions.
7.6.157	Later sections will provide more information about what else is required to make even spontaneous reactions happen more efficiently.
7.6.158	An important concept in the study of metabolism and energy is that of chemical equilibrium.
7.6.159	Most chemical reactions are reversible.
7.6.160	They can proceed in both directions, releasing energy into their environment in one direction, and absorbing it from the environment in the other direction (Figure 6.9).
7.6.161	The same is true for the chemical reactions involved in cell metabolism, such as the breaking down and building up of proteins into and from individual amino acids, respectively.
7.6.162	Reactants within a closed system will undergo chemical reactions in both directions until a state of equilibrium is reached.
7.6.163	This state of equilibrium is one of the lowest possible free energy and a state of maximal entropy.
7.6.164	Energy must be put into the system to push the reactants and products away from a state of equilibrium.
7.6.165	Either reactants or products must be added, removed, or changed.
7.6.166	If a cell were a closed system, its chemical reactions would reach equilibrium, and it would die because there would be insufficient free energy left to perform the work needed to maintain life.
7.6.167	In a living cell, chemical reactions are constantly moving towards equilibrium, but never reach it.
7.6.168	This is because a living cell is an open system.
7.6.169	Materials pass in and out, the cell recycles the products of certain chemical reactions into other reactions, and chemical equilibrium is never reached.
7.6.170	In this way, living organisms are in a constant energy-requiring, uphill battle against equilibrium and entropy.
7.6.171	This constant supply of energy ultimately comes from sunlight, which is used to produce nutrients in the process of photosynthesis.
7.6.172	Exergonic and endergonic reactions result in changes in Gibbs free energy.
7.6.173	Exergonic reactions release energy; endergonic reactions require energy to proceed.
7.6.174	Activation Energy There is another important concept that must be considered regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions.
7.6.175	Even exergonic reactions require a small amount of energy input to get going before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps.
7.6.176	These reactions have a net release of energy, but still require some energy in the beginning.
7.6.177	This small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the activation energy (or free energy of activation) and is abbreviated EA (Figure 6.10).
7.6.178	Why would an energy-releasing, negative ΔG reaction actually require some energy to proceed?
7.6.179	The reason lies in the steps that take place during a chemical reaction.
7.6.180	During chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds are broken and new ones are formed.
7.6.181	For example, when a glucose molecule is broken down, bonds between the carbon atoms of the molecule are broken.
7.6.182	Since these are energy-storing bonds, they release energy when broken.
7.6.183	However, to get them into a state that allows the bonds to break, the molecule must be somewhat contorted.
7.6.184	A small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state.
7.6.185	This contorted state is called the transition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state.
7.6.186	For this reason, reactant molecules don’t last long in their transition state, but very quickly proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction.
7.6.187	Free energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a given reaction.
7.6.188	Whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic determines whether the products in the diagram will exist at a lower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the products.
7.6.189	However, regardless of this measure, the transition state of the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the reactants, and thus, EA is always positive.
7.6.190	Where does the activation energy required by chemical reactants come from?
7.6.191	The source of the activation energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings.
7.6.192	Heat energy (the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction) speeds up the motion of molecules, increasing the frequency and force with which they collide; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly, helping them reach their transition state.
7.6.193	For this reason, heating up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently.
7.6.194	Increasing the pressure on a system has the same effect.
7.6.195	Once reactants have absorbed enough heat energy from their surroundings to reach the transition state, the reaction will proceed.
7.6.196	The activation energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed.
7.6.197	The higher the activation energy, the slower the chemical reaction will be.
7.6.198	The example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow reaction.
7.6.199	This reaction occurs slowly over time because of its high EA.
7.6.200	Additionally, the burning of many fuels, which is strongly exergonic, will take place at a negligible rate unless their activation energy is overcome by sufficient heat from a spark.
7.6.201	Once they begin to burn, however, the chemical reactions release enough heat to continue the burning process, supplying the activation energy for surrounding fuel molecules.
7.6.202	Like these reactions outside of cells, the activation energy for most cellular reactions is too high for heat energy to overcome at efficient rates.
7.6.203	In other words, in order for important cellular reactions to occur at appreciable rates (number of reactions per unit time), their activation energies must be lowered (Figure 6.10); this is referred to as catalysis.
7.6.204	This is a very good thing as far as living cells are concerned.
7.6.205	Important macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, store considerable energy, and their breakdown is exergonic.
7.6.206	If cellular temperatures alone provided enough heat energy for these exergonic reactions to overcome their activation barriers, the essential components of a cell would disintegrate.
7.6.207	Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter.
7.6.208	The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings.
7.6.209	For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water.
7.6.210	Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water).
7.6.211	There are two types of systems: open and closed.
7.6.212	An open system is one in which energy can be transferred between the system and its surroundings.
7.6.213	The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost into the air.
7.6.214	A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings.
7.6.215	Biological organisms are open systems.
7.6.216	Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energystoring molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work.
7.6.217	Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to the laws of physics.
7.6.218	The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.
7.6.219	The First Law of Thermodynamics
7.6.220	The first law of thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe.
7.6.221	It states that this total amount of energy is constant.
7.6.222	In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe.
7.6.223	Energy exists in many different forms.
7.6.224	According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may be transferred from place to place or transformed into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed.
7.6.225	The transfers and transformations of energy take place around us all the time.
7.6.226	Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light energy.
7.6.227	Gas stoves transform chemical energy from natural gas into heat energy.
7.6.228	Plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy transformations on earth: that of converting the energy of sunlight into the chemical energy stored within organic molecules (Figure 6.2).
7.6.229	Some examples of energy transformations are shown in Figure 6.11.
7.6.230	The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or transform into usable energy to do work.
7.6.231	Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge very well.
7.6.232	Chemical energy stored within organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transformed through a series of cellular chemical reactions into energy within molecules of ATP.
7.6.233	Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work.
7.6.234	Examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the beating motion of cilia or flagella, contracting muscle fibers to create movement, and reproduction.
7.6.235	Shown are two examples of energy being transferred from one system to another and transformed from one form to another.
7.6.236	Humans can convert the chemical energy in food, like this ice cream cone, into kinetic energy (the energy of movement to ride a bicycle).
7.6.237	Plants can convert electromagnetic radiation (light energy) from the sun into chemical energy.
7.6.238	The Second Law of Thermodynamics A living cell’s primary tasks of obtaining, transforming, and using energy to do work may seem simple.
7.6.239	However, the second law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear.
7.6.240	None of the energy transfers we’ve discussed, along with all energy transfers and transformations in the universe, is completely efficient.
7.6.241	In every energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable.
7.6.242	In most cases, this form is heat energy.
7.6.243	Thermodynamically, heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not doing work.
7.6.244	For example, when an airplane flies through the air, some of the energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air.
7.6.245	This friction actually heats the air by temporarily increasing the speed of air molecules.
7.6.246	Likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions.
7.6.247	This is good for warm-blooded creatures like us, because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature.
7.6.248	Strictly speaking, no energy transfer is completely efficient, because some energy is lost in an unusable form.
7.6.249	An important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder (also known as randomness).
7.6.250	The more energy that is lost by a system to its surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is.
7.6.251	Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder within a system as entropy.
7.6.252	High entropy means high disorder and low energy (Figure 6.12).
7.6.253	To better understand entropy, think of a student’s bedroom.
7.6.254	If no energy or work were put into it, the room would quickly become messy.
7.6.255	It would exist in a very disordered state, one of high entropy.
7.6.256	Energy must be put into the system, in the form of the student doing work and putting everything away, in order to bring the room back to a state of cleanliness and order.
7.6.257	This state is one of low entropy.
7.6.258	Similarly, a car or house must be constantly maintained with work in order to keep it in an ordered state.
7.6.259	Left alone, the entropy of the house or car gradually increases through rust and degradation.
7.6.260	Molecules and chemical reactions have varying amounts of entropy as well.
7.6.261	For example, as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium, entropy increases, and as molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out, entropy also increases.
7.6.262	All physical systems can be thought of in this way: Living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to be maintained in a state of low entropy.
7.6.263	As living systems take in energy-storing molecules and transform them through chemical reactions, they lose some amount of usable energy in the process, because no reaction is completely efficient.
7.6.264	They also produce waste and by-products that aren’t useful energy sources.
7.6.265	This process increases the entropy of the system’s surroundings.
7.6.266	Since all energy transfers result in the loss of some usable energy, the second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe.
7.6.267	Even though living things are highly ordered and maintain a state of low entropy, the entropy of the universe in total is constantly increasing due to the loss of usable energy with each energy transfer that occurs.
7.6.268	Essentially, living things are in a continuous uphill battle against this constant increase in universal entropy.
7.6.269	Entropy is a measure of randomness or disorder in a system.
7.6.270	Gases have higher entropy than liquids, and liquids have higher entropy than solids.
7.6.271	Even exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy in order to proceed.
7.6.272	However, consider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input, because their products have more free energy than their reactants.
7.6.273	Within the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from?
7.6.274	The answer lies with an energysupplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.
7.6.275	ATP is a small, relatively simple molecule (Figure 6.13), but within some of its bonds, it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work.
7.6.276	This molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in much the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for things they need.
7.6.277	ATP is used to power the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.
7.6.278	ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell.
7.6.279	It has an adenosine backbone with three phosphate groups attached.
7.6.280	As its name suggests, adenosine triphosphate is comprised of adenosine bound to three phosphate groups (Figure 6.13).
7.6.281	Adenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a five-carbon sugar, ribose.
7.6.282	The three phosphate groups, in order of closest to furthest from the ribose sugar, are labeled alpha, beta, and gamma.
7.6.283	Together, these chemical groups constitute an energy powerhouse.
7.6.284	However, not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high-energy state.
7.6.285	Both bonds that link the phosphates are equally high-energy bonds ( phosphoanhydride bonds) that, when broken, release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes.
7.6.286	These high-energy bonds are the bonds between the second and third (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups.
7.6.287	The reason that these bonds are considered “high-energy” is because the products of such bond breaking—adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group (Pi)—have considerably lower free energy than the reactants:
7.6.288	ATP and a water molecule.
7.6.289	Because this reaction takes place with the use of a water molecule, it is considered a hydrolysis reaction.
7.6.290	In other words, ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP in the following reaction: ATP + H2O
7.6.291	→ ADP +
7.6.292	Pi + free energy Like most chemical reactions, the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is reversible.
7.6.293	The reverse reaction regenerates ATP from ADP + Pi.
7.6.294	Indeed, cells rely on the regeneration of ATP just as people rely on the regeneration of spent money through some sort of income.
7.6.295	Since ATP hydrolysis releases energy, ATP regeneration must require an input of free energy.
7.6.296	The formation of ATP is expressed in this equation: ADP + Pi + free energy
7.6.297	→ ATP + H2O
7.6.298	Two prominent questions remain with regard to the use of ATP as an energy source.
7.6.299	Exactly how much free energy is released with the hydrolysis of ATP, and how is that free energy used to do cellular work?
7.6.300	The calculated ΔG for the hydrolysis of one mole of ATP into ADP and Pi is −7.3 kcal/mole (−30.5 kJ/mol).
7.6.301	Since this calculation is true under standard conditions, it would be expected that a different value exists under cellular conditions.
7.6.302	In fact, the ΔG for the hydrolysis of one mole of ATP in a living cell is almost double the value at standard conditions: 14 kcal/mol (−57 kJ/mol).
7.6.303	ATP is a highly unstable molecule.
7.6.304	Unless quickly used to perform work, ATP spontaneously dissociates into ADP + Pi, and the free energy released during this process is lost as heat.
7.6.305	The second question posed above, that is, how the energy released by ATP hydrolysis is used to perform work inside the cell, depends on a strategy called energy coupling.
7.6.306	Cells couple the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions, allowing them to proceed.
7.6.307	One example of energy coupling using ATP involves a transmembrane ion pump that is extremely important for cellular function.
7.6.308	This sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+ pump) drives sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell (Figure 6.14).
7.6.309	A large percentage of a cell’s ATP is spent powering this pump, because cellular processes bring a great deal of sodium into the cell and potassium out of the cell.
7.6.310	The pump works constantly to stabilize cellular concentrations of sodium and potassium.
7.6.311	In order for the pump to turn one cycle (exporting three Na+ ions and importing two K+ ions), one molecule of ATP must be hydrolyzed.
7.6.312	When ATP is hydrolyzed, its gamma phosphate doesn’t simply float away, but is actually transferred onto the pump protein.
7.6.313	This process of a phosphate group binding to a molecule is called phosphorylation.
7.6.314	As with most cases of ATP hydrolysis, a phosphate from ATP is transferred onto another molecule.
7.6.315	In a phosphorylated state, the Na+/K+ pump has more free energy and is triggered to undergo a conformational change.
7.6.316	This change allows it to release Na+ to the outside of the cell.
7.6.317	It then binds extracellular K+, which, through another conformational change, causes the phosphate to detach from the pump.
7.6.318	This release of phosphate triggers the K+ to be released to the inside of the cell.
7.6.319	Essentially, the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP is coupled with the energy required to power the pump and transport Na+ and K+ ions.
7.6.320	ATP performs cellular work using this basic form of energy coupling through phosphorylation.
7.6.321	Often during cellular metabolic reactions, such as the synthesis and breakdown of nutrients, certain molecules must be altered slightly in their conformation to become substrates for the next step in the reaction series.
7.6.322	One example is during the very first steps of cellular respiration, when a molecule of the sugar glucose is broken down in the process of glycolysis.
7.6.323	In the first step of this process, ATP is required for the phosphorylation of glucose, creating a high-energy but unstable intermediate.
7.6.324	This phosphorylation reaction powers a conformational change that allows the phosphorylated glucose molecule to be converted to the phosphorylated sugar fructose.
7.6.325	Fructose is a necessary intermediate for glycolysis to move forward.
7.6.326	Here, the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled with the endergonic reaction of converting glucose into a phosphorylated intermediate in the pathway.
7.6.327	Once again, the energy released by breaking a phosphate bond within ATP was used for the phosphorylation of another molecule, creating an unstable intermediate and powering an important conformational change.
7.6.328	A substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is a catalyst, and the special molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions are called enzymes.
7.6.329	Almost all enzymes are proteins, made up of chains of amino acids, and they perform the critical task of lowering the activation energies of chemical reactions inside the cell.
7.6.330	Enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules, and holding them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes take place more readily.
7.6.331	It is important to remember that enzymes don’t change the ΔG of a reaction.
7.6.332	In other words, they don’t change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic.
7.6.333	This is because they don’t change the free energy of the reactants or products.
7.6.334	They only reduce the activation energy required to reach the transition state.
7.6.335	Enzyme Active Site and Substrate Specificity
7.6.336	The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme’s substrates.
7.6.337	There may be one or more substrates, depending on the particular chemical reaction.
7.6.338	In some reactions, a single-reactant substrate is broken down into multiple products.
7.6.339	In others, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule.
7.6.340	Two reactants might also enter a reaction, both become modified, and leave the reaction as two products.
7.6.341	The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme’s active site.
7.6.342	The active site is where the “action” happens, so to speak.
7.6.343	Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid residues (also called side chains, or R groups) within the active site.
7.6.344	Each residue is characterized by different properties.
7.6.345	Residues can be large or small, weakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral.
7.6.346	The unique combination of amino acid residues, their positions, sequences, structures, and properties, creates a very specific chemical environment within the active site.
7.6.347	This specific environment is suited to bind, albeit briefly, to a specific chemical substrate (or substrates).
7.6.348	Due to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates (which adapts to find the best fit between the transition state and the active site), enzymes are known for their specificity.
7.6.349	The “best fit” results from the shape and the amino acid functional group’s attraction to the substrate.
7.6.350	There is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction; however, there is flexibility as well.
7.6.351	The fact that active sites are so perfectly suited to provide specific environmental conditions also means that they are subject to influences by the local environment.
7.6.352	It is true that increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction rates, enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise.
7.6.353	However, increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can affect chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well suited to bind substrates.
7.6.354	High temperatures will eventually cause enzymes, like other biological molecules, to denature, a process that changes the natural properties of a substance.
7.6.355	Likewise, the pH of the local environment can also affect enzyme function.
7.6.356	Active site amino acid residues have their own acidic or basic properties that are optimal for catalysis.
7.6.357	These residues are sensitive to changes in pH that can impair the way substrate molecules bind.
7.6.358	Enzymes are suited to function best within a certain pH range, and, as with temperature, extreme pH values (acidic or basic) of the environment can cause enzymes to denature.
7.6.359	Induced Fit and Enzyme Function
7.6.360	For many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple “lock-and-key” fashion.
7.6.361	This model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step.
7.6.362	However, current research supports a more refined view called induced fit (Figure 6.16).
7.6.363	The induced-fit model expands upon the lock-and-key model by describing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate.
7.6.364	As the enzyme and substrate come together, their interaction causes a mild shift in the enzyme’s structure that confirms an ideal binding arrangement between the enzyme and the transition state of the substrate.
7.6.365	This ideal binding maximizes the enzyme’s ability to catalyze its reaction.
7.6.366	When an enzyme binds its substrate, an enzyme-substrate complex is formed.
7.6.367	This complex lowers the activation energy of the reaction and promotes its rapid progression in one of many ways.
7.6.368	On a basic level, enzymes promote chemical reactions that involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation.
7.6.369	The appropriate region (atoms and bonds) of one molecule is juxtaposed to the appropriate region of the other molecule with which it must react.
7.6.370	Another way in which enzymes promote the reaction of their substrates is by creating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur.
7.6.371	Certain chemical reactions might proceed best in a slightly acidic or non-polar environment.
7.6.372	The chemical properties that emerge from the particular arrangement of amino acid residues within an active site create the perfect environment for an enzyme’s specific substrates to react.
7.6.373	You’ve learned that the activation energy required for many reactions includes the energy involved in manipulating or slightly contorting chemical bonds so that they can easily break and allow others to reform.
7.6.374	Enzymatic action can aid this process.
7.6.375	The enzyme-substrate complex can lower the activation energy by contorting substrate molecules in such a way as to facilitate bond-breaking, helping to reach the transition state.
7.6.376	Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical reaction itself.
7.6.377	The amino acid residues can provide certain ions or chemical groups that actually form covalent bonds with substrate molecules as a necessary step of the reaction process.
7.6.378	In these cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will always return to its original state at the completion of the reaction.
7.6.379	One of the hallmark properties of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze.
7.6.380	After an enzyme is done catalyzing a reaction, it releases its product(s).
7.6.381	According to the induced-fit model, both enzyme and substrate undergo dynamic conformational changes upon binding.
7.6.382	The enzyme contorts the substrate into its transition state, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction.
7.6.383	Control of Metabolism
7.6.384	Through Enzyme Regulation
7.6.385	It would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all of the enzymes encoded in an organism’s genome existed in abundant supply and functioned optimally under all cellular conditions, in all cells, at all times.
7.6.386	In reality, this is far from the case.
7.6.387	A variety of mechanisms ensure that this does not happen.
7.6.388	Cellular needs and conditions vary from cell to cell, and change within individual cells over time.
7.6.389	The required enzymes and energetic demands of stomach cells are different from those of fat storage cells, skin cells, blood cells, and nerve cells.
7.6.390	Furthermore, a digestive cell works much harder to process and break down nutrients during the time that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal.
7.6.391	As these cellular demands and conditions vary, so do the amounts and functionality of different enzymes.
7.6.392	Since the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine activation energies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a cell ultimately determine which reactions will proceed and at which rates.
7.6.393	This determination is tightly controlled.
7.6.394	In certain cellular environments, enzyme activity is partly controlled by environmental factors, like pH and temperature.
7.6.395	There are other mechanisms through which cells control the activity of enzymes and determine the rates at which various biochemical reactions will occur.
7.6.396	Regulation of Enzymes by Molecules Enzymes can be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce their activity.
7.6.397	There are many different kinds of molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms exist for doing so.
7.6.398	In some cases of enzyme inhibition, for example, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding.
7.6.399	When this happens, the enzyme is inhibited through competitive inhibition, because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for active site binding (Figure 6.17).
7.6.400	On the other hand, in noncompetitive inhibition, an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than an allosteric site and still manages to block substrate binding to the active site.
7.6.401	Competitive and noncompetitive inhibition affect the rate of reaction differently.
7.6.402	Competitive inhibitors affect the initial rate but do not affect the maximal rate, whereas noncompetitive inhibitors affect the maximal rate.
7.6.403	Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.
7.6.404	This type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition (Figure 6.18).
7.6.405	Most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide, meaning that they have more than one protein subunit.
7.6.406	When an allosteric inhibitor binds to an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits are changed slightly such that they bind their substrates with less efficiency.
7.6.407	There are allosteric activators as well as inhibitors.
7.6.408	Allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from the active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme’s active site(s) for its substrate(s).
7.6.409	Allosteric inhibitors modify the active site of the enzyme so that substrate binding is reduced or prevented.
7.6.410	In contrast, allosteric activators modify the active site of the enzyme so that the affinity for the substrate increases.
7.6.411	Many enzymes don’t work optimally, or even at all, unless bound to other specific non-protein helper molecules, either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds.
7.6.412	Two types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes.
7.6.413	Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective enzymes.
7.6.414	Cofactors are inorganic ions such as iron (Fe++) and magnesium (Mg++).
7.6.415	One example of an enzyme that requires a metal ion as a cofactor is the enzyme that builds DNA molecules, DNA polymerase, which requires bound zinc ion (Zn++) to function.
7.6.416	Coenzymes are organic helper molecules, with a basic atomic structure made up of carbon and hydrogen, which are required for enzyme action.
7.6.417	The most common sources of coenzymes are dietary vitamins (Figure 6.20).
7.6.418	Some vitamins are precursors to coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes.
7.6.419	Vitamin C is a coenzyme for multiple enzymes that take part in building the important connective tissue component, collagen.
7.6.420	An important step in the breakdown of glucose to yield energy is catalysis by a multi-enzyme complex called pyruvate dehydrogenase.
7.6.421	Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a complex of several enzymes that actually requires one cofactor (a magnesium ion) and five different organic coenzymes to catalyze its specific chemical reaction.
7.6.422	Therefore, enzyme function is, in part, regulated by an abundance of various cofactors and coenzymes, which are supplied primarily by the diets of most organisms.
7.6.423	Vitamins are important coenzymes or precursors of coenzymes, and are required for enzymes to function properly.
7.6.424	Multivitamin capsules usually contain mixtures of all the vitamins at different percentages.
7.6.425	Enzyme Compartmentalization
7.6.426	In eukaryotic cells, molecules such as enzymes are usually compartmentalized into different organelles.
7.6.427	This allows for yet another level of regulation of enzyme activity.
7.6.428	Enzymes required only for certain cellular processes can be housed separately along with their substrates, allowing for more efficient chemical reactions.
7.6.429	Examples of this sort of enzyme regulation based on location and proximity include the enzymes involved in the latter stages of cellular respiration, which take place exclusively in the mitochondria, and the enzymes involved in the digestion of cellular debris and foreign materials, located within lysosomes.
7.6.430	Feedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways Molecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways.
7.6.431	A major question remains, however: What are these molecules and where do they come from?
7.6.432	Some are cofactors and coenzymes, ions, and organic molecules, as you’ve learned.
7.6.433	What other molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation, such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and noncompetitive inhibition?
7.6.434	The answer is that a wide variety of molecules can perform these roles.
7.6.435	Some of these molecules include pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical drugs, toxins, and poisons from the environment.
7.6.436	Perhaps the most relevant sources of enzyme regulatory molecules, with respect to cellular metabolism, are the products of the cellular metabolic reactions themselves.
7.6.437	In a most efficient and elegant way, cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity.
7.6.438	Feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production (Figure 6.21).
7.6.439	The cell responds to the abundance of specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions.
7.6.440	Such reaction products may inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the mechanisms described above.
7.6.441	Metabolic pathways are a series of reactions catalyzed by multiple enzymes.
7.6.442	Feedback inhibition, where the end product of the pathway inhibits an upstream step, is an important regulatory mechanism in cells.
7.6.443	The production of both amino acids and nucleotides is controlled through feedback inhibition.
7.6.444	Additionally, ATP is an allosteric regulator of some of the enzymes involved in the catabolic breakdown of sugar, the process that produces ATP.
7.6.445	In this way, when ATP is abundant, the cell can prevent its further production.
7.6.446	Remember that ATP is an unstable molecule that can spontaneously dissociate into ADP.
7.6.447	If too much ATP were present in a cell, much of it would go to waste.
7.6.448	On the other hand, ADP serves as a positive allosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes that are inhibited by ATP.
7.6.449	Thus, when relative levels of ADP are high compared to ATP, the cell is triggered to produce more ATP through the catabolism of sugar.
7.7.0	The electrical energy plant in Figure 7.1 converts energy from one form to another form that can be more easily used.
7.7.1	This type of generating plant starts with underground thermal energy (heat) and transforms it into electrical energy that will be transported to homes and factories.
7.7.2	Like a generating plant, plants and animals also must take in energy from the environment and convert it into a form that their cells can use.
7.7.3	Energy enters an organism’s body in one form and is converted into another form that can fuel the organism’s life functions.
7.7.4	In the process of photosynthesis, plants and other photosynthetic producers take in energy in the form of light (solar energy) and convert it into chemical energy, glucose, which stores this energy in its chemical bonds.
7.7.5	Then, a series of metabolic pathways, collectively called cellular respiration, extracts the energy from the bonds in glucose and converts it into a form that all living things can use—both producers, such as plants, and consumers, such as animals.
7.7.6	Energy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways.
7.7.7	Most of these pathways are combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions.
7.7.8	Oxidation and reduction occur in tandem.
7.7.9	An oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction.
7.7.10	Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are called oxidation reduction reactions, or redox reactions.
7.7.11	Electrons and Energy
7.7.12	The removal of an electron from a molecule, oxidizing it, results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized compound.
7.7.13	The electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom), does not remain unbonded, however, in the cytoplasm of a cell.
7.7.14	Rather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the second compound.
7.7.15	The shift of an electron from one compound to another removes some potential energy from the first compound (the oxidized compound) and increases the potential energy of the second compound (the reduced compound).
7.7.16	The transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most of the energy stored in atoms and used to fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons.
7.7.17	The transfer of energy in the form of electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an incremental fashion—in small packages rather than in a single, destructive burst.
7.7.18	This chapter focuses on the extraction of energy from food; you will see that as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking the path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways.
7.7.19	Electron Carriers
7.7.20	In living systems, a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles: They bind and carry high-energy electrons between compounds in pathways.
7.7.21	The principal electron carriers we will consider are derived from the B vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides.
7.7.22	These compounds can be easily reduced (that is, they accept electrons) or oxidized (they lose electrons).
7.7.23	Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
7.7.24	(Figure 7.2) is derived from vitamin B3, niacin.
7.7.25	NAD+ is the oxidized form of the molecule; NADH is the reduced form of the molecule after it has accepted two electrons and a proton (which together are the equivalent of a hydrogen atom with an extra electron).
7.7.26	NAD+ can accept electrons from an organic molecule according to the general equation: RH Reducing agent + NAD+
7.7.27	Oxidizing agent →
7.7.28	NADH Reduced + R Oxidized
7.7.29	When electrons are added to a compound, they are reduced.
7.7.30	A compound that reduces another is called a reducing agent.
7.7.31	In the above equation, RH is a reducing agent, and NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
7.7.32	When electrons are removed from compound, it oxidized.
7.7.33	A compound that oxidizes another is called an oxidizing agent.
7.7.34	In the above equation, NAD+ is an oxidizing agent, and RH is oxidized to R. Similarly, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD+) is derived from vitamin B2, also called riboflavin.
7.7.35	Its reduced form is FADH2.
7.7.36	A second variation of NAD, NADP, contains an extra phosphate group.
7.7.37	Both NAD+ and FAD+ are extensively used in energy extraction from sugars, and NADP plays an important role in anabolic reactions and photosynthesis.
7.7.38	The oxidized form of the electron carrier (NAD+) is shown on the left and the reduced form (NADH) is shown on the right.
7.7.39	The nitrogenous base in NADH has one more hydrogen ion and two more electrons than in NAD+.
7.7.40	ATP in Living Systems
7.7.41	A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy.
7.7.42	Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell, which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell.
7.7.43	Rather, a cell must be able to handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed.
7.7.44	Living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
7.7.45	ATP is often called the “energy currency” of the cell, and, like currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell.
7.7.46	How?
7.7.47	It functions similarly to a rechargeable battery.
7.7.48	When ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released.
7.7.49	The energy is used to do work by the cell, usually by the released phosphate binding to another molecule, activating it.
7.7.50	For example, in the mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins.
7.7.51	Recall the active transport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes.
7.7.52	ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that functions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium.
7.7.53	In this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions against their electrochemical gradients.
7.7.54	ATP Structure and Function
7.7.55	At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a ribose molecule and to a single phosphate group (Figure 7.3).
7.7.56	Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in RNA, and AMP is one of the nucleotides in RNA.
7.7.57	The addition of a second phosphate group to this core molecule results in the formation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP); the addition of a third phosphate group forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
7.7.58	ATP (adenosine triphosphate) has three phosphate groups that can be removed by hydrolysis to form ADP (adenosine diphosphate) or AMP
7.7.59	(adenosine monophosphate).The negative charges on the phosphate group naturally repel each other, requiring energy to bond them together and releasing energy when these bonds are broken.
7.7.60	The addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires energy.
7.7.61	Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one another when they are arranged in series, as they are in ADP and ATP.
7.7.62	This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable.
7.7.63	The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP, a process called dephosphorylation, releases energy.
7.7.64	Energy from ATP Hydrolysis is the process of breaking complex macromolecules apart.
7.7.65	During hydrolysis, water is split, or lysed, and the resulting hydrogen atom (H+) and a hydroxyl group (OH-) are added to the larger molecule.
7.7.66	The hydrolysis of ATP produces ADP, together with an inorganic phosphate ion (Pi), and the release of free energy.
7.7.67	To carry out life processes, ATP is continuously broken down into ADP, and like a rechargeable battery, ADP is continuously regenerated into ATP by the reattachment of a third phosphate group.
7.7.68	Water, which was broken down into its hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group during ATP hydrolysis, is regenerated when a third phosphate is added to the ADP molecule, reforming ATP.
7.7.69	Obviously, energy must be infused into the system to regenerate ATP.
7.7.70	Where does this energy come from?
7.7.71	In nearly every living thing on earth, the energy comes from the metabolism of glucose.
7.7.72	In this way, ATP is a direct link between the limited set of exergonic pathways of glucose catabolism and the multitude of endergonic pathways that power living cells.
7.7.73	Phosphorylation Recall that, in some chemical reactions, enzymes may bind to several substrates that react with each other on the enzyme, forming an intermediate complex.
7.7.74	An intermediate complex is a temporary structure, and it allows one of the substrates (such as ATP) and reactants to more readily react with each other; in reactions involving ATP, ATP is one of the substrates and ADP is a product.
7.7.75	During an endergonic chemical reaction, ATP forms an intermediate complex with the substrate and enzyme in the reaction.
7.7.76	This intermediate complex allows the ATP to transfer its third phosphate group, with its energy, to the substrate, a process called phosphorylation.
7.7.77	Phosphorylation refers to the addition of the phosphate (~P).
7.7.78	This is illustrated by the following generic reaction:
7.7.79	A + enzyme + ATP →
7.7.80	⎡ ⎣A − enzyme − ∼ P⎤⎦
7.7.81	→ B + enzyme + ADP + phosphate ion
7.7.82	When the intermediate complex breaks apart, the energy is used to modify the substrate and convert it into a product of the reaction.
7.7.83	The ADP molecule and a free phosphate ion are released into the medium and are available for recycling through cell metabolism.
7.7.84	Substrate Phosphorylation ATP is generated through two mechanisms during the breakdown of glucose.
7.7.85	A few ATP molecules are generated (that is, regenerated from ADP) as a direct result of the chemical reactions that occur in the catabolic pathways.
7.7.86	A phosphate group is removed from an intermediate reactant in the pathway, and the free energy of the reaction is used to add the third phosphate to an available ADP molecule, producing ATP (Figure 7.4).
7.7.87	This very direct method of phosphorylation is called substrate-level phosphorylation.
7.7.88	In phosphorylation reactions, the gamma phosphate of ATP is attached to a protein.
7.7.89	Oxidative Phosphorylation Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism, however, is derived from a much more complex process, chemiosmosis, which takes place in mitochondria (Figure 7.5) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell.
7.7.90	Chemiosmosis, a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism, is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight.
7.7.91	The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process.
7.7.92	In eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation takes place in mitochondria.
7.7.93	In prokaryotes, this process takes place in the plasma membrane.
7.7.94	You have read that nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar, glucose.
7.7.95	Glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism.
7.7.96	Nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism.
7.7.97	The process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic.
7.7.98	Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
7.7.99	Glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two ways.
7.7.100	One method is through secondary active transport in which the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient.
7.7.101	The other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called GLUT proteins, also known as glucose transporter proteins.
7.7.102	These transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose.
7.7.103	Glycolysis begins with the six carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate.
7.7.104	Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases.
7.7.105	The first part of the glycolysis pathway traps the glucose molecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into the two three-carbon molecules.
7.7.106	The second part of glycolysis extracts energy from the molecules and stores it in the form of ATP and NADH, the reduced form of NAD.
7.7.107	First Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Requiring Steps)
7.7.108	Step 1.
7.7.109	The first step in glycolysis (Figure 7.6) is catalyzed by hexokinase, an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes the phosphorylation of six-carbon sugars.
7.7.110	Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as the source of the phosphate, producing glucose-6-phosphate, a more reactive form of glucose.
7.7.111	This reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose molecule from continuing to interact with the GLUT proteins, and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively charged phosphate will not allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane.
7.7.112	Step 2.
7.7.113	In the second step of glycolysis, an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers, fructose-6-phosphate.
7.7.114	An isomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers.
7.7.115	(This change from phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules.).
7.7.116	Step 3.
7.7.117	The third step is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase.
7.7.118	A second ATP molecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
7.7.119	In this pathway, phosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme.
7.7.120	It is active when the concentration of ADP is high; it is less active when ADP levels are low and the concentration of ATP is high.
7.7.121	Thus, if there is “sufficient” ATP in the system, the pathway slows down.
7.7.122	This is a type of end product inhibition, since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism.
7.7.123	Step 4.
7.7.124	The newly added high-energy phosphates further destabilize fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
7.7.125	The fourth step in glycolysis employs an enzyme, aldolase, to cleave 1,6-bisphosphate into two three-carbon isomers: dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
7.7.126	Step 5.
7.7.127	In the fifth step, an isomerase transforms the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate into its isomer, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
7.7.128	Thus, the pathway will continue with two molecules of a single isomer.
7.7.129	At this point in the pathway, there is a net investment of energy from two ATP molecules in the breakdown of one glucose molecule.
7.7.130	The first half of glycolysis uses two ATP molecules in the phosphorylation of glucose, which is then split into two three-carbon molecules.
7.7.131	Second Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Releasing Steps)
7.7.132	So far, glycolysis has cost the cell two ATP molecules and produced two small, three-carbon sugar molecules.
7.7.133	Both of these molecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway, and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two ATP molecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of two additional ATP molecules and two even higher-energy NADH molecules.
7.7.134	Step 6.
7.7.135	The sixth step in glycolysis (Figure 7.7) oxidizes the sugar (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), extracting high-energy electrons, which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD+, producing NADH.
7.7.136	The sugar is then phosphorylated by the addition of a second phosphate group, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.
7.7.137	Note that the second phosphate group does not require another ATP molecule.
7.7.138	The second half of glycolysis involves phosphorylation without ATP investment (step 6) and produces two NADH and four ATP molecules per glucose.
7.7.139	Here again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway.
7.7.140	The continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of the oxidized form of the electron carrier, NAD+.
7.7.141	Thus, NADH must be continuously oxidized back into NAD+ in order to keep this step going.
7.7.142	If NAD+ is not available, the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops.
7.7.143	If oxygen is available in the system, the NADH will be oxidized readily, though indirectly, and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released in this process will be used to produce ATP.
7.7.144	In an environment without oxygen, an alternate pathway (fermentation) can provide the oxidation of NADH to NAD+.
7.7.145	Step 7.
7.7.146	In the seventh step, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase (an enzyme named for the reverse reaction), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a high-energy phosphate to ADP, forming one molecule of ATP.
7.7.147	(This is an example of substrate-level phosphorylation.)
7.7.148	A carbonyl group on the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is oxidized to a carboxyl group, and 3-phosphoglycerate is formed.
7.7.149	Step 8.
7.7.150	In the eighth step, the remaining phosphate group in 3-phosphoglycerate moves from the third carbon to the second carbon, producing 2-phosphoglycerate (an isomer of 3-phosphoglycerate).
7.7.151	The enzyme catalyzing this step is a mutase (isomerase).
7.7.152	Step 9.
7.7.153	Enolase catalyzes the ninth step.
7.7.154	This enzyme causes 2-phosphoglycerate to lose water from its structure; this is a dehydration reaction, resulting in the formation of a double bond that increases the potential energy in the remaining phosphate bond and produces phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).
7.7.155	Step 10.
7.7.156	The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase (the enzyme in this case is named for the reverse reaction of pyruvate’s conversion into PEP) and results in the production of a second ATP molecule by substratelevel phosphorylation and the compound pyruvic acid (or its salt form, pyruvate).
7.7.157	Many enzymes in enzymatic pathways are named for the reverse reactions, since the enzyme can catalyze both forward and reverse reactions (these may have been described initially by the reverse reaction that takes place in vitro, under non-physiological conditions).
7.7.158	Outcomes of Glycolysis Glycolysis starts with glucose and ends with two pyruvate molecules, a total of four ATP molecules and two molecules of NADH.
7.7.159	Two ATP molecules were used in the first half of the pathway to prepare the six-carbon ring for cleavage, so the cell has a net gain of two ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules for its use.
7.7.160	If the cell cannot catabolize the pyruvate molecules further, it will harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose.
7.7.161	Mature mammalian red blood cells are not capable of aerobic respiration—the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen—and glycolysis is their sole source of ATP.
7.7.162	If glycolysis is interrupted, these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium-potassium pumps, and eventually, they die.
7.7.163	The last step in glycolysis will not occur if pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of pyruvate, is not available in sufficient quantities.
7.7.164	In this situation, the entire glycolysis pathway will proceed, but only two ATP molecules will be made in the second half.
7.7.165	Thus, pyruvate kinase is a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis.
7.7.166	If oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward.
7.7.167	In eukaryotic cells, the pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolysis are transported into mitochondria, which are the sites of cellular respiration.
7.7.168	There, pyruvate will be transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA).
7.7.169	The resulting compound is called acetyl CoA. CoA is made from vitamin B5, pantothenic acid.
7.7.170	Acetyl CoA can be used in a variety of ways by the cell, but its major function is to deliver the acetyl group derived from pyruvate to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism.
7.7.171	Breakdown of Pyruvate
7.7.172	In order for pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, to enter the next pathway, it must undergo several changes.
7.7.173	The conversion is a three-step process (Figure 7.8).
7.7.174	Step 1.
7.7.175	A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide into the surrounding medium.
7.7.176	The result of this step is a two-carbon hydroxyethyl group bound to the enzyme (pyruvate dehydrogenase).
7.7.177	This is the first of the six carbons from the original glucose molecule to be removed.
7.7.178	This step proceeds twice (remember: there are two pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolsis) for every molecule of glucose metabolized; thus, two of the six carbons will have been removed at the end of both steps.
7.7.179	Step 2.
7.7.180	The hydroxyethyl group is oxidized to an acetyl group, and the electrons are picked up by NAD+, forming NADH.
7.7.181	The high-energy electrons from NADH will be used later to generate ATP.
7.7.182	Step 3.
7.7.183	The enzyme-bound acetyl group is transferred to CoA, producing a molecule of acetyl CoA. Upon entering the mitochondrial matrix, a multi-enzyme complex converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA.
7.7.184	In the process, carbon dioxide is released and one molecule of NADH is formed.
7.7.185	Note that during the second stage of glucose metabolism, whenever a carbon atom is removed, it is bound to two oxygen atoms, producing carbon dioxide, one of the major end products of cellular respiration.
7.7.186	Acetyl CoA to CO2
7.7.187	In the presence of oxygen, acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl group to a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form citrate, a six-carbon molecule with three carboxyl groups; this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from what began as a glucose molecule.
7.7.188	This single pathway is called by different names: the citric acid cycle (for the first intermediate formed—citric acid, or citrate—when acetate joins to the oxaloacetate), the TCA cycle (since citric acid or citrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic acids), and the Krebs cycle, after Hans Krebs, who first identified the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles.
7.7.189	Citric Acid Cycle Like the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the citric acid cycle takes place in the matrix of mitochondria.
7.7.190	Almost all of the enzymes of the citric acid cycle are soluble, with the single exception of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.
7.7.191	Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop: The last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step.
7.7.192	The eight steps of the cycle are a series of redox, dehydration, hydration, and decarboxylation reactions that produce two carbon dioxide molecules, one GTP/ATP, and reduced forms of NADH and FADH2
7.7.193	(Figure 7.9).
7.7.194	This is considered an aerobic pathway because the NADH and FADH2 produced must transfer their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen.
7.7.195	If this transfer does not occur, the oxidation steps of the citric acid cycle also do not occur.
7.7.196	Note that the citric acid cycle produces very little ATP directly and does not directly consume oxygen.
7.7.197	In the citric acid cycle, the acetyl group from acetyl CoA is attached to a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon citrate molecule.
7.7.198	Through a series of steps, citrate is oxidized, releasing two carbon dioxide molecules for each acetyl group fed into the cycle.
7.7.199	In the process, three NAD+ molecules are reduced to NADH, one FAD molecule is reduced to FADH2, and one ATP or GTP (depending on the cell type) is produced (by substrate-level phosphorylation).
7.7.200	Because the final product of the citric acid cycle is also the first reactant, the cycle runs continuously in the presence of sufficient reactants.
7.7.201	(credit: modification of work by “Yikrazuul”/Wikimedia Commons) Steps in the Citric Acid Cycle Step 1.
7.7.202	Prior to the start of the first step, a transitional phase occurs during which pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA.
7.7.203	Then, the first step of the cycle begins: This is a condensation step, combining the two-carbon acetyl group with a fourcarbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon molecule of citrate.
7.7.204	CoA is bound to a sulfhydryl group (-SH) and diffuses away to eventually combine with another acetyl group.
7.7.205	This step is irreversible because it is highly exergonic.
7.7.206	The rate of this reaction is controlled by negative feedback and the amount of ATP available.
7.7.207	If ATP levels increase, the rate of this reaction decreases.
7.7.208	If ATP is in short supply, the rate increases.
7.7.209	Step 2.
7.7.210	In step two, citrate loses one water molecule and gains another as citrate is converted into its isomer, isocitrate.
7.7.211	Step 3.
7.7.212	In step three, isocitrate is oxidized, producing a five-carbon molecule, α-ketoglutarate, together with a molecule of CO2 and two electrons, which reduce NAD+ to NADH.
7.7.213	This step is also regulated by negative feedback from ATP and NADH, and a positive effect of ADP.
7.7.214	Steps 3 and 4.
7.7.215	Steps three and four are both oxidation and decarboxylation steps, which release electrons that reduce NAD+ to NADH and release carboxyl groups that form CO2 molecules.
7.7.216	α-Ketoglutarate is the product of step three, and a succinyl group is the product of step four.
7.7.217	CoA binds the succinyl group to form succinyl CoA.
7.7.218	The enzyme that catalyzes step four is regulated by feedback inhibition of ATP, succinyl CoA, and NADH.
7.7.219	Step 5.
7.7.220	In step five, a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme A, and a high-energy bond is formed.
7.7.221	This energy is used in substrate-level phosphorylation (during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate) to form either guanine triphosphate (GTP) or ATP.
7.7.222	There are two forms of the enzyme, called isoenzymes, for this step, depending upon the type of animal tissue in which they are found.
7.7.223	One form is found in tissues that use large amounts of ATP, such as heart and skeletal muscle.
7.7.224	This form produces ATP.
7.7.225	The second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic pathways, such as liver.
7.7.226	This form produces GTP.
7.7.227	GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP; however, its use is more restricted.
7.7.228	In particular, protein synthesis primarily uses GTP.
7.7.229	Step 6.
7.7.230	Step six is a dehydration process that converts succinate into fumarate.
7.7.231	Two hydrogen atoms are transferred to FAD, producing FADH2.
7.7.232	The energy contained in the electrons of these atoms is insufficient to reduce NAD+ but adequate to reduce FAD.
7.7.233	Unlike NADH, this carrier remains attached to the enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron transport chain directly.
7.7.234	This process is made possible by the localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.
7.7.235	Step 7.
7.7.236	Water is added to fumarate during step seven, and malate is produced.
7.7.237	The last step in the citric acid cycle regenerates oxaloacetate by oxidizing malate.
7.7.238	Another molecule of NADH is produced in the process.
7.7.239	Products of the Citric Acid Cycle
7.7.240	Two carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group, representing four out of the six carbons of one glucose molecule.
7.7.241	Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not necessarily contain the most recently added carbon atoms.
7.7.242	The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the cycle; thus, all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide.
7.7.243	Each turn of the cycle forms three NADH molecules and one FADH2 molecule.
7.7.244	These carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration to produce ATP molecules.
7.7.245	One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle.
7.7.246	Several of the intermediate compounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing non-essential amino acids; therefore, the cycle is amphibolic (both catabolic and anabolic).
7.7.247	You have just read about two pathways in glucose catabolism—glycolysis and the citric acid cycle—that generate ATP.
7.7.248	Most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from these pathways.
7.7.249	Rather, it is derived from a process that begins with moving electrons through a series of electron transporters that undergo redox reactions.
7.7.250	This causes hydrogen ions to accumulate within the matrix space.
7.7.251	Therefore, a concentration gradient forms in which hydrogen ions diffuse out of the matrix space by passing through ATP synthase.
7.7.252	The current of hydrogen ions powers the catalytic action of ATP synthase, which phosphorylates ADP, producing ATP.
7.7.253	Electron Transport Chain
7.7.254	The electron transport chain (Figure 7.10) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of glucose metabolism that uses atmospheric oxygen.
7.7.255	Oxygen continuously diffuses into plants; in animals, it enters the body through the respiratory system.
7.7.256	Electron transport is a series of redox reactions that resemble a relay race or bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next, to the endpoint of the chain where the electrons reduce molecular oxygen, producing water.
7.7.257	There are four complexes composed of proteins, labeled I through IV in Figure 7.10, and the aggregation of these four complexes, together with associated mobile, accessory electron carriers, is called the electron transport chain.
7.7.258	The electron transport chain is present in multiple copies in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes.
7.7.259	The electron transport chain is a series of electron transporters embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane that shuttles electrons from NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen.
7.7.260	In the process, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, and oxygen is reduced to form water.
7.7.261	Complex I
7.7.262	To start, two electrons are carried to the first complex aboard NADH.
7.7.263	This complex, labeled I, is composed of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and an iron-sulfur (Fe-S)-containing protein.
7.7.264	FMN, which is derived from vitamin B2, also called riboflavin, is one of several prosthetic groups or co-factors in the electron transport chain.
7.7.265	A prosthetic group is a nonprotein molecule required for the activity of a protein.
7.7.266	Prosthetic groups are organic or inorganic, non-peptide molecules bound to a protein that facilitate its function; prosthetic groups include co-enzymes, which are the prosthetic groups of enzymes.
7.7.267	The enzyme in complex
7.7.268	I is NADH dehydrogenase and is a very large protein, containing 45 amino acid chains.
7.7.269	Complex I can pump four hydrogen ions across the membrane from the matrix into the intermembrane space, and it is in this way that the hydrogen ion gradient is established and maintained between the two compartments separated by the inner mitochondrial membrane.
7.7.270	Q and Complex II Complex II directly receives FADH2, which does not pass through
7.7.271	complex I. The compound connecting the first and second complexes to the third is ubiquinone (Q).
7.7.272	The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic core of the membrane.
7.7.273	Once it is reduced, (QH2), ubiquinone delivers its electrons to the next complex in the electron transport chain.
7.7.274	Q receives the electrons derived from NADH from complex I and the electrons derived from FADH2 from complex II, including succinate dehydrogenase.
7.7.275	This enzyme and FADH2 form a small complex that delivers electrons directly to the electron transport chain, bypassing the first complex.
7.7.276	Since these electrons bypass and thus do not energize the proton pump in the first complex, fewer ATP molecules are made from the FADH2 electrons.
7.7.277	The number of ATP molecules ultimately obtained is directly proportional to the number of protons pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
7.7.278	Complex III
7.7.279	The third complex is composed of cytochrome b, another Fe-S protein, Rieske center (2Fe-2S center), and cytochrome c proteins; this complex is also called cytochrome oxidoreductase.
7.7.280	Cytochrome proteins have a prosthetic group of heme.
7.7.281	The heme molecule is similar to the heme in hemoglobin, but it carries electrons, not oxygen.
7.7.282	As a result, the iron ion at its core is reduced and oxidized as it passes the electrons, fluctuating between different oxidation states: Fe++ (reduced) and Fe+++ (oxidized).
7.7.283	The heme molecules in the cytochromes have slightly different characteristics due to the effects of the different proteins binding them, giving slightly different characteristics to each complex.
7.7.284	Complex III pumps protons through the membrane and passes its electrons to cytochrome c for transport to the fourth complex of proteins and enzymes (cytochrome c is the acceptor of electrons from Q; however, whereas Q carries pairs of electrons, cytochrome c can accept only one at a time).
7.7.285	Complex IV
7.7.286	The fourth complex is composed of cytochrome proteins c, a, and a3.
7.7.287	This complex contains two heme groups (one in each of the two cytochromes, a, and a3) and three copper ions (a pair of CuA and one CuB in cytochrome a3).
7.7.288	The cytochromes hold an oxygen molecule very tightly between the iron and copper ions until the oxygen is completely reduced.
7.7.289	The reduced oxygen then picks up two hydrogen ions from the surrounding medium to make water (H2O).
7.7.290	The removal of the hydrogen ions from the system contributes to the ion gradient used in the process of chemiosmosis.
7.7.291	Chemiosmosis
7.7.292	In chemiosmosis, the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions (protons) across the membrane.
7.7.293	The uneven distribution of H+ ions across the membrane establishes both concentration and electrical gradients (thus, an electrochemical gradient), owing to the hydrogen ions’ positive charge and their aggregation on one side of the membrane.
7.7.294	If the membrane were open to diffusion by the hydrogen ions, the ions would tend to diffuse back across into the matrix, driven by their electrochemical gradient.
7.7.295	Recall that many ions cannot diffuse through the nonpolar regions of phospholipid membranes without the aid of ion channels.
7.7.296	Similarly, hydrogen ions in the matrix space can only pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane through an integral membrane protein called ATP synthase (Figure 7.11).
7.7.297	This complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down their electrochemical gradient.
7.7.298	The turning of parts of this molecular machine facilitates the addition of a phosphate to ADP, forming ATP, using the potential energy of the hydrogen ion gradient.
7.7.299	Chemiosmosis (Figure 7.12) is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during aerobic glucose catabolism; it is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight in the process of photophosphorylation.
7.7.300	Recall that the production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis in mitochondria is called oxidative phosphorylation.
7.7.301	The overall result of these reactions is the production of ATP from the energy of the electrons removed from hydrogen atoms.
7.7.302	These atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule.
7.7.303	At the end of the pathway, the electrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions.
7.7.304	The extra electrons on the oxygen attract hydrogen ions (protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is formed.
7.7.305	ATP Yield
7.7.306	The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies.
7.7.307	For example, the number of hydrogen ions that the electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between species.
7.7.308	Another source of variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the membranes of the mitochondria.
7.7.309	(The NADH generated from glycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria.)
7.7.310	Thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of mitochondria by either NAD+ or FAD+.
7.7.311	As you have learned earlier, these FAD+ molecules can transport fewer ions; consequently, fewer ATP molecules are generated when FAD+ acts as a carrier.
7.7.312	NAD+ is used as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD+ acts in the brain.
7.7.313	Another factor that affects the yield of ATP molecules generated from glucose is the fact that intermediate compounds in these pathways are used for other purposes.
7.7.314	Glucose catabolism connects with the pathways that build or break down all other biochemical compounds in cells, and the result is somewhat messier than the ideal situations described thus far.
7.7.315	For example, sugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway for energy extraction.
7.7.316	Moreover, the five-carbon sugars that form nucleic acids are made from intermediates in glycolysis.
7.7.317	Certain nonessential amino acids can be made from intermediates of both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
7.7.318	Lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, are also made from intermediates in these pathways, and both amino acids and triglycerides are broken down for energy through these pathways.
7.7.319	Overall, in living systems, these pathways of glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained in glucose.
7.7.320	In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, O2.
7.7.321	If aerobic respiration occurs, then ATP will be produced using the energy of high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH2 to the electron transport chain.
7.7.322	If aerobic respiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+ for reuse as an electron carrier for the glycolytic pathway to continue.
7.7.323	How is this done?
7.7.324	Some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor.
7.7.325	Processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate NAD+ from NADH are collectively referred to as fermentation.
7.7.326	In contrast, some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor.
7.7.327	Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen.
7.7.328	Anaerobic Cellular Respiration Certain prokaryotes, including some species of bacteria and Archaea, use anaerobic respiration.
7.7.329	For example, the group of Archaea called methanogens reduces carbon dioxide to methane to oxidize NADH.
7.7.330	These microorganisms are found in soil and in the digestive tracts of ruminants, such as cows and sheep.
7.7.331	Similarly, sulfate-reducing bacteria and Archaea, most of which are anaerobic ( Figure 7.13), reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide to regenerate NAD+ from NADH.
7.7.332	The green color seen in these coastal waters is from an eruption of hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria.
7.7.333	These anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria release hydrogen sulfide gas as they decompose algae in the water.
7.7.334	The enzyme used in this reaction is lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
7.7.335	The reaction can proceed in either direction, but the reaction from left to right is inhibited by acidic conditions.
7.7.336	Such lactic acid accumulation was once believed to cause muscle stiffness, fatigue, and soreness, although more recent research disputes this hypothesis.
7.7.337	Once the lactic acid has been removed from the muscle and circulated to the liver, it can be reconverted into pyruvic acid and further catabolized for energy.
7.7.338	Alcohol Fermentation
7.7.339	Another familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation ( Figure 7.15) that produces ethanol, an alcohol.
7.7.340	The first chemical reaction of alcohol fermentation is the following (CO2 does not participate in the second reaction):
7.7.341	Pyruvic acid
7.7.342	→ CO2 + acetaldehyde
7.7.343	+ NADH
7.7.344	→ ethanol
7.7.345	+
7.7.346	NAD+ The first reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, with a coenzyme of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP, derived from vitamin B1 and also called thiamine).
7.7.347	A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvic acid, releasing carbon dioxide as a gas.
7.7.348	The loss of carbon dioxide reduces the size of the molecule by one carbon, making acetaldehyde.
7.7.349	The second reaction is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase to oxidize NADH to NAD+ and reduce acetaldehyde to ethanol.
7.7.350	The fermentation of pyruvic acid by yeast produces the ethanol found in alcoholic beverages.
7.7.351	Ethanol tolerance of yeast is variable, ranging from about 5 percent to 21 percent, depending on the yeast strain and environmental conditions.
7.7.352	Fermentation of grape juice into wine produces CO2 as a byproduct.
7.7.353	Fermentation tanks have valves so that the pressure inside the tanks created by the carbon dioxide produced can be released.
7.7.354	Other Types of Fermentation
7.7.355	Other fermentation methods occur in bacteria.
7.7.356	Many prokaryotes are facultatively anaerobic.
7.7.357	This means that they can switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of oxygen.
7.7.358	Certain prokaryotes, like Clostridia, are obligate anaerobes.
7.7.359	Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen.
7.7.360	Oxygen is a poison to these microorganisms and kills them on exposure.
7.7.361	It should be noted that all forms of fermentation, except lactic acid fermentation, produce gas.
7.7.362	The production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the fermentation of specific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria.
7.7.363	Various methods of fermentation are used by assorted organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD+ for the sixth step in glycolysis.
7.7.364	Without these pathways, that step would not occur and no ATP would be harvested from the breakdown of glucose.
7.7.365	You have learned about the catabolism of glucose, which provides energy to living cells.
7.7.366	But living things consume more than glucose for food.
7.7.367	How does a turkey sandwich end up as ATP in your cells?
7.7.368	This happens because all of the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids eventually connect into glycolysis and the citric acid cycle pathways (see Figure 7.17).
7.7.369	Metabolic pathways should be thought of as porous—that is, substances enter from other pathways, and intermediates leave for other pathways.
7.7.370	These pathways are not closed systems.
7.7.371	Many of the substrates, intermediates, and products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways.
7.7.372	Connections of Other Sugars to Glucose Metabolism Glycogen, a polymer of glucose, is an energy storage molecule in animals.
7.7.373	When there is adequate ATP present, excess glucose is shunted into glycogen for storage.
7.7.374	Glycogen is made and stored in both liver and muscle.
7.7.375	The glycogen will be hydrolyzed into glucose monomers (G-1-P) if blood sugar levels drop.
7.7.376	The presence of glycogen as a source of glucose allows ATP to be produced for a longer period of time during exercise.
7.7.377	Glycogen is broken down into G-1-P and converted into G-6-P in both muscle and liver cells, and this product enters the glycolytic pathway.
7.7.378	Sucrose is a disaccharide with a molecule of glucose and a molecule of fructose bonded together with a glycosidic linkage.
7.7.379	Fructose is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose (which is part of the milk sugar, the disaccharide lactose), which are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion.
7.7.380	The catabolism of both fructose and galactose produces the same number of ATP molecules as glucose.
7.7.381	Connections of Proteins to Glucose Metabolism Proteins are hydrolyzed by a variety of enzymes in cells.
7.7.382	Most of the time, the amino acids are recycled into the synthesis of new proteins.
7.7.383	If there are excess amino acids, however, or if the body is in a state of starvation, some amino acids will be shunted into the pathways of glucose catabolism (Figure 7.16).
7.7.384	Each amino acid must have its amino group removed prior to entry into these pathways.
7.7.385	The amino group is converted into ammonia.
7.7.386	In mammals, the liver synthesizes urea from two ammonia molecules and a carbon dioxide molecule.
7.7.387	Thus, urea is the principal waste product in mammals produced from the nitrogen originating in amino acids, and it leaves the body in urine.
7.7.388	The carbon skeletons of certain amino acids (indicated in boxes) derived from proteins can feed into the citric acid cycle.
7.7.389	Connections of Lipid and Glucose Metabolisms
7.7.390	The lipids that are connected to the glucose pathways are cholesterol and triglycerides.
7.7.391	Cholesterol is a lipid that contributes to cell membrane flexibility and is a precursor of steroid hormones.
7.7.392	The synthesis of cholesterol starts with acetyl groups and proceeds in only one direction.
7.7.393	The process cannot be reversed.
7.7.394	Triglycerides are a form of long-term energy storage in animals.
7.7.395	Triglycerides are made of glycerol and three fatty acids.
7.7.396	Animals can make most of the fatty acids they need.
7.7.397	Triglycerides can be both made and broken down through parts of the glucose catabolism pathways.
7.7.398	Glycerol can be phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate, which continues through glycolysis.
7.7.399	Fatty acids are catabolized in a process called beta-oxidation that takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria and converts their fatty acid chains into two carbon units of acetyl groups.
7.7.400	The acetyl groups are picked up by CoA to form acetyl CoA that proceeds into the citric acid cycle.
7.7.401	Glycogen from the liver and muscles, hydrolyzed into glucose-1-phosphate, together with fats and proteins, can feed into the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates.
7.7.402	Cellular respiration must be regulated in order to provide balanced amounts of energy in the form of ATP.
7.7.403	The cell also must generate a number of intermediate compounds that are used in the anabolism and catabolism of macromolecules.
7.7.404	Without controls, metabolic reactions would quickly come to a stand still as the forward and backward reactions reached a state of equilibrium.
7.7.405	Resources would be used inappropriately.
7.7.406	A cell does not need the maximum amount of ATP that it can make all the time: At times, the cell needs to shunt some of the intermediates to pathways for amino acid, protein, glycogen, lipid, and nucleic acid production.
7.7.407	In short, the cell needs to control its metabolism.
7.7.408	Regulatory Mechanisms
7.7.409	A variety of mechanisms is used to control cellular respiration.
7.7.410	Some type of control exists at each stage of glucose metabolism.
7.7.411	Access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the GLUT proteins that transport glucose (Figure 7.18).
7.7.412	Different forms of the GLUT protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues.
7.7.413	GLUT4 is a glucose transporter that is stored in vesicles.
7.7.414	A cascade of events that occurs upon insulin binding to a receptor in the plasma membrane causes GLUT4-containing vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane so that glucose may be transported into the cell.
7.7.415	Some reactions are controlled by having two different enzymes—one each for the two directions of a reversible reaction.
7.7.416	Reactions that are catalyzed by only one enzyme can go to equilibrium, stalling the reaction.
7.7.417	In contrast, if two different enzymes (each specific for a given direction) are necessary for a reversible reaction, the opportunity to control the rate of the reaction increases, and equilibrium is not reached.
7.7.418	A number of enzymes involved in each of the pathways—in particular, the enzyme catalyzing the first committed reaction of the pathway—are controlled by attachment of a molecule to an allosteric site on the protein.
7.7.419	The molecules most commonly used in this capacity are the nucleotides ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, and NADH.
7.7.420	These regulators, allosteric effectors, may increase or decrease enzyme activity, depending on the prevailing conditions.
7.7.421	The allosteric effector alters the steric structure of the enzyme, usually affecting the configuration of the active site.
7.7.422	This alteration of the protein’s (the enzyme’s) structure either increases or decreases its affinity for its substrate, with the effect of increasing or decreasing the rate of the reaction.
7.7.423	The attachment signals to the enzyme.
7.7.424	This binding can increase or decrease the enzyme’s activity, providing feedback.
7.7.425	This feedback type of control is effective as long as the chemical affecting it is attached to the enzyme.
7.7.426	Once the overall concentration of the chemical decreases, it will diffuse away from the protein, and the control is relaxed.
7.7.427	Control of Catabolic Pathways Enzymes, proteins, electron carriers, and pumps that play roles in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain tend to catalyze non-reversible reactions.
7.7.428	In other words, if the initial reaction takes place, the pathway is committed to proceeding with the remaining reactions.
7.7.429	Whether a particular enzyme activity is released depends upon the energy needs of the cell (as reflected by the levels of ATP, ADP, and AMP).
7.7.430	Glycolysis
7.7.431	The control of glycolysis begins with the first enzyme in the pathway, hexokinase (Figure 7.19).
7.7.432	This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, which helps to prepare the compound for cleavage in a later step.
7.7.433	The presence of the negatively charged phosphate in the molecule also prevents the sugar from leaving the cell.
7.7.434	When hexokinase is inhibited, glucose diffuses out of the cell and does not become a substrate for the respiration pathways in that tissue.
7.7.435	The product of the hexokinase reaction is glucose-6-phosphate, which accumulates when a later enzyme, phosphofructokinase, is inhibited.
7.7.436	The glycolysis pathway is primarily regulated at the three key enzymatic steps (1, 2, and 7) as indicated.
7.7.437	Note that the first two steps that are regulated occur early in the pathway and involve hydrolysis of ATP.
7.7.438	Phosphofructokinase is the main enzyme controlled in glycolysis.
7.7.439	High levels of ATP, citrate, or a lower, more acidic pH decrease the enzyme’s activity.
7.7.440	An increase in citrate concentration can occur because of a blockage in the citric acid cycle.
7.7.441	Fermentation, with its production of organic acids like lactic acid, frequently accounts for the increased acidity in a cell; however, the products of fermentation do not typically accumulate in cells.
7.7.442	The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase.
7.7.443	The pyruvate produced can proceed to be catabolized or converted into the amino acid alanine.
7.7.444	If no more energy is needed and alanine is in adequate supply, the enzyme is inhibited.
7.7.445	The enzyme’s activity is increased when fructose-1,6-bisphosphate levels increase.
7.7.446	(Recall that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an intermediate in the first half of glycolysis.)
7.7.447	The regulation of pyruvate kinase involves phosphorylation by a kinase (pyruvate kinase kinase), resulting in a less-active enzyme.
7.7.448	Dephosphorylation by a phosphatase reactivates it.
7.7.449	Pyruvate kinase is also regulated by ATP (a negative allosteric effect).
7.7.450	If more energy is needed, more pyruvate will be converted into acetyl CoA through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase.
7.7.451	If either acetyl groups or NADH accumulate, there is less need for the reaction and the rate decreases.
7.7.452	Pyruvate dehydrogenase is also regulated by phosphorylation: A kinase phosphorylates it to form an inactive enzyme, and a phosphatase reactivates it.
7.7.453	The kinase and the phosphatase are also regulated.
7.7.454	Citric Acid Cycle
7.7.455	The citric acid cycle is controlled through the enzymes that catalyze the reactions that make the first two molecules of NADH (Figure 7.9).
7.7.456	These enzymes are isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.
7.7.457	When adequate ATP and NADH levels are available, the rates of these reactions decrease.
7.7.458	When more ATP is needed, as reflected in rising ADP levels, the rate increases.
7.7.459	α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase will also be affected by the levels of succinyl CoA—a subsequent intermediate in the cycle—causing a decrease in activity.
7.7.460	A decrease in the rate of operation of the pathway at this point is not necessarily negative, as the increased levels of the α-ketoglutarate not used by the citric acid cycle can be used by the cell for amino acid (glutamate) synthesis.
7.7.461	Electron Transport Chain Specific enzymes of the electron transport chain are unaffected by feedback inhibition, but the rate of electron transport through the pathway is affected by the levels of ADP and ATP.
7.7.462	Greater ATP consumption by a cell is indicated by a buildup of ADP.
7.7.463	As ATP usage decreases, the concentration of ADP decreases, and now, ATP begins to build up in the cell.
7.7.464	This change is the relative concentration of ADP to ATP triggers the cell to slow down the electron transport chain.
7.8.0	This world map shows Earth’s distribution of photosynthesis as seen via chlorophyll a concentrations.
7.8.1	On land, this is evident via terrestrial plants, and in oceanic zones, via phytoplankton.
7.8.2	The processes in all organisms—from bacteria to humans—require energy.
7.8.3	To get this energy, many organisms access stored energy by eating, that is, by ingesting other organisms.
7.8.4	But where does the stored energy in food originate?
7.8.5	All of this energy can be traced back to photosynthesis.
7.8.6	Photosynthesis is essential to all life on earth; both plants and animals depend on it.
7.8.7	It is the only biological process that can capture energy that originates in outer space (sunlight) and convert it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every organism uses to power its metabolism.
7.8.8	In brief, the energy of sunlight is captured and used to energize electrons, which are then stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules.
7.8.9	How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds?
7.8.10	The energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis almost 200 million years ago.
7.8.11	Plants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis (Figure 8.2).
7.8.12	Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called photoautotrophs (literally, “self-feeders using light”).
7.8.13	Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most other bacteria, are termed heterotrophs (“other feeders”), because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs.
7.8.14	A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars, not by using sunlight’s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds; hence, they are referred to as chemoautotrophs.
7.8.15	Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds via photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source.
7.8.16	Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous areas in water, at times completely covering the surface.
7.8.17	In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these (e) thermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds.
7.8.18	The ecosystem surrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopi that derive energy from the bacteria.
7.8.19	The importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlight’s energy.
7.8.20	A lizard sunning itself on a cold day can use the sun’s energy to warm up.
7.8.21	Photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy in solar radiation (the “photo-” part) as high-energy electrons in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the “-synthesis” part).
7.8.22	Those carbohydrates are the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration.
7.8.23	Therefore, photosynthesis powers 99 percent of Earth’s ecosystems.
7.8.24	When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (Figure 8.3), the wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer, and finally to wolf.
7.8.25	The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain.
7.8.26	The predator that eats these deer receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the deer consumed.

7.8.28	Main Structures and Summary of Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (which is low in energy), and water as substrates (Figure 8.4).
7.8.29	After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P), simple carbohydrate molecules (which are high in energy) that can subsequently be converted into glucose, sucrose, or any of dozens of other sugar molecules.
7.8.30	These sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon that all living things need to survive.
7.8.31	Photosynthesis uses solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce energy-storing carbohydrates.
7.8.32	Oxygen is generated as a waste product of photosynthesis.
7.8.33	Photosynthesis uses solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce energy-storing carbohydrates.
7.8.34	Oxygen is generated as a waste product of photosynthesis.
7.8.35	The basic equation for photosynthesis is deceptively simple.
7.8.36	In reality, the process takes place in many steps involving intermediate reactants and products.
7.8.37	Glucose, the primary energy source in cells, is made from two three-carbon GA3Ps.
7.8.38	Although the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex.
7.8.39	Before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures involved.
7.8.40	In plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells.
7.8.41	The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll.
7.8.42	The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance.
7.8.43	The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss.
7.8.44	Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes.
7.8.45	In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast.
7.8.46	For plants, chloroplastcontaining cells exist in the mesophyll.
7.8.47	Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane).
7.8.48	Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids.
7.8.49	Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain.
7.8.50	The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen.
7.8.51	As shown in Figure 8.6, a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “bed
7.8.52	” (not to be confused with stoma or “mouth,” an opening on the leaf epidermis).
7.8.53	The Two Parts of Photosynthesis Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light independent-reactions.
7.8.54	In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy.
7.8.55	In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drive the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide.
7.8.56	Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use light as a reactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function.
7.8.57	In addition, several enzymes of the light-independent reactions are activated by light.
7.8.58	The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store the energy: These are referred to as energy carriers.
7.8.59	The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to light-independent reactions can be thought of as “full” because they are rich in energy.
7.8.60	After the energy is released, the “empty” energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy.
7.8.61	Figure 8.7 illustrates the components inside the chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place.
7.8.62	Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: light dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.
7.8.63	Light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membrane, use light energy to make ATP and NADPH.
7.8.64	The Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, uses energy derived from these compounds to make GA3P from CO2.
7.8.65	How can light be used to make food?
7.8.66	When a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy.
7.8.67	Like all other forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work.
7.8.68	In the case of photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use to build carbohydrate molecules (Figure 8.9).
7.8.69	However, autotrophs only use a few specific components of sunlight.
7.8.70	What Is Light Energy?
7.8.71	The sun emits an enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation (solar energy).
7.8.72	Humans can see only a fraction of this energy, which portion is therefore referred to as “visible light.
7.8.73	”
7.8.74	The manner in which solar energy travels is described as waves.
7.8.75	Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength, the distance between consecutive points of a wave.
7.8.76	A single wave is measured from two consecutive points, such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough.
7.8.77	The wavelength of a single wave is the distance between two consecutive points of similar position (two crests or two troughs) along the wave.
7.8.78	Visible light constitutes only one of many types of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun and other stars.
7.8.79	Scientists differentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum.
7.8.80	The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of radiation (Figure 8.11).
7.8.81	The difference between wavelengths relates to the amount of energy carried by them.
7.8.82	The sun emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.
7.8.83	This radiation exists at different wavelengths, each of which has its own characteristic energy.
7.8.84	All electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is characterized by its wavelength.
7.8.85	Each type of electromagnetic radiation travels at a particular wavelength.
7.8.86	The longer the wavelength (or the more stretched out
7.8.87	it appears in the diagram), the less energy is carried.
7.8.88	Short, tight waves carry the most energy.
7.8.89	This may seem illogical, but think of it in terms of a piece of moving a heavy rope.
7.8.90	It takes little effort by a person to move a rope in long, wide waves.
7.8.91	To make a rope move in short, tight waves, a person would need to apply significantly more energy.
7.8.92	The electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 8.11) shows several types of electromagnetic radiation originating from the sun, including X-rays and ultraviolet (UV) rays.
7.8.93	The higher-energy waves can penetrate tissues and damage cells and DNA, explaining why both X-rays and UV rays can be harmful to living organisms.
7.8.94	Absorption of Light Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light.
7.8.95	Organic pigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb.
7.8.96	Energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state.
7.8.97	Energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching.
7.8.98	So retinal pigments can only “see”
7.8.99	(absorb) 700
7.8.100	nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light.
7.8.101	For the same reasons, plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation.
7.8.102	The visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors.
7.8.103	Certain objects, such as a prism or a drop of water, disperse white light to reveal the colors to the human eye.
7.8.104	The visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum shows the rainbow of colors, with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths, and therefore higher energy.
7.8.105	At the other end of the spectrum toward red, the wavelengths are longer and have lower energy.
7.8.106	The colors of visible light do not carry the same amount of energy.
7.8.107	Violet has the shortest wavelength and therefore carries the most energy, whereas red has the longest wavelength and carries the least amount of energy.
7.8.108	(credit: modification of work by NASA)
7.8.109	Understanding Pigments Different kinds of pigments exist, and each has evolved to absorb only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light.
7.8.110	Pigments reflect or transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear in the corresponding color.
7.8.111	Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class has multiple types of pigment molecules.
7.8.112	There are five major chlorophylls: a, b, c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll.
7.8.113	Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll
7.8.114	b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion.
7.8.115	With dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments.
7.8.116	The carotenoids found in fruit—such as the red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (β-carotene)—are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers.
7.8.117	In photosynthesis, carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy.
7.8.118	When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage.
7.8.119	Therefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat.
7.8.120	Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is the absorption spectrum.
7.8.121	The graph in Figure 8.13 shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and a type of carotenoid pigment called β-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light).
7.8.122	Notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks and troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption.
7.8.123	Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not green.
7.8.124	Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green.
7.8.125	Carotenoids absorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths.
7.8.126	Chlorophyll a, (b) chlorophyll b, and (c) β-carotene are hydrophobic organic pigments found in the thylakoid membrane.
7.8.127	Chlorophyll a and b, which are identical except for the part indicated in the red box, are responsible for the green color of leaves.
7.8.128	β-carotene is responsible for the orange color in carrots.
7.8.129	Each pigment has (d) a unique absorbance spectrum.
7.8.130	Many photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments; using them, the organism can absorb energy from a wider range of wavelengths.
7.8.131	Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight.
7.8.132	Some organisms grow underwater where light intensity and quality decrease and change with depth.
7.8.133	Other organisms grow in competition for light.
7.8.134	Plants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees absorb most of the sunlight and scatter the remaining solar radiation.
7.8.135	Plants that commonly grow in the shade have adapted to low levels of light by changing the relative concentrations of their chlorophyll pigments.

7.8.137	When studying a photosynthetic organism, scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption spectra.
7.8.138	An instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb.
7.8.139	Spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption.
7.8.140	By extracting pigments from leaves and placing these samples into a spectrophotometer, scientists can identify which wavelengths of light an organism can absorb.
7.8.141	Additional methods for the identification of plant pigments include various types of chromatography that separate the pigments by their relative affinities to solid and mobile phases.
7.8.142	How Light-Dependent Reactions Work
7.8.143	The overall function of light-dependent reactions is to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP.
7.8.144	This chemical energy supports the light-independent reactions and fuels the assembly of sugar molecules.
7.8.145	The light-dependent reactions are depicted in Figure 8.15.
7.8.146	Protein complexes and pigment molecules work together to produce NADPH and ATP.
7.8.147	A photosystem consists of a light-harvesting complex and a reaction center.
7.8.148	Pigments in the lightharvesting complex pass light energy to two special chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction center.
7.8.149	The light excites an electron from the chlorophyll a pair, which passes to the primary electron acceptor.
7.8.150	The excited electron must then be replaced.
7.8.151	In (a) photosystem II, the electron comes from the splitting of water, which releases oxygen as a waste product.
7.8.152	In (b) photosystem I, the electron comes from the chloroplast electron transport chain discussed below.
7.8.153	The actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called a photosystem, two types of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane,
7.8.154	photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI)
7.8.155	(Figure 8.16).
7.8.156	The two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize (that is, the source of the low-energy electron supply) and what they reduce (the place to which they deliver their energized electrons).
7.8.157	Both photosystems have the same basic structure; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place.
7.8.158	Each photosystem is serviced by the lightharvesting complex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300–400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids.
7.8.159	The absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or “packet” of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state.
7.8.160	In short, the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet.
7.8.161	The energy is transferred from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until eventually (after about a millionth of a second), it is delivered to the reaction center.
7.8.162	Up to this point, only energy has been transferred between molecules, not electrons.
7.8.163	The reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property.
7.8.164	Those two chlorophylls can undergo oxidation upon excitation; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact.
7.8.165	It is at this step in the reaction center, this step in photosynthesis, that light energy is converted into an excited electron.
7.8.166	All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long-term storage in the form of a carbohydrate.
7.8.167	PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which also includes the cytochrome complex.
7.8.168	The cytochrome complex, an enzyme composed of two protein complexes, transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone (Pq) to the protein plastocyanin (Pc), thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI.
7.8.169	The reaction center of PSII (called P680) delivers its high-energy electrons, one at the time, to the primary electron acceptor, and through the electron transport chain
7.8.170	(Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine) to PSI.
7.8.171	P680’s missing electron is replaced by extracting a low-energy electron from water; thus, water is split and PSII is re-reduced after every photoact.
7.8.172	Splitting one H2O molecule releases two electrons, two hydrogen atoms, and one atom of oxygen.
7.8.173	Splitting two molecules is required to form one molecule of diatomic O2 gas.
7.8.174	About 10 percent of the oxygen is used by mitochondria in the leaf to support oxidative phosphorylation.
7.8.175	The remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by aerobic organisms to support respiration.
7.8.176	As electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI, they lose energy.
7.8.177	That energy is used to move hydrogen atoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen.
7.8.178	Those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones produced by splitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used synthesize ATP in a later step.
7.8.179	Because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI, they must be re-energized by PSI, hence, another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna.
7.8.180	That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center (called P700).
7.8.181	P700 is oxidized and sends a highenergy electron to NADP+ to form NADPH.
7.8.182	Thus, PSII captures the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP, and PSI captures the energy to reduce NADP+ into NADPH.
7.8.183	The two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee that the production of NADPH will roughly equal the production of ATP.
7.8.184	Other mechanisms exist to fine tune that ratio to exactly match the chloroplast’s constantly changing energy needs.
7.8.185	Generating an Energy Carrier:
7.8.186	ATP As in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the thylakoid lumen creates a concentration gradient.
7.8.187	The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the thylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create ATP, just as in the electron transport chain of cellular respiration.
7.8.188	The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge, repelling each other.
7.8.189	To release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam.
7.8.190	In the thylakoid, that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase.
7.8.191	The energy released by the hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP (Figure 8.16).
7.8.192	The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an area of high to an area of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure.
7.8.193	After the energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy and temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH molecules, the cell has the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for long-term energy storage.
7.8.194	The products of the light-dependent reactions, ATP and NADPH, have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds, whereas the products of the lightindependent reactions (carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon) can survive for hundreds of millions of years.
7.8.195	The carbohydrate molecules made will have a backbone of carbon atoms.
7.8.196	Where does the carbon come from?
7.8.197	It comes from carbon dioxide, the gas that is a waste product of respiration in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals.
7.8.198	The Calvin Cycle
7.8.199	In plants, carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the leaves through stomata, where it diffuses over short distances through intercellular spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells.
7.8.200	Once in the mesophyll cells, CO2 diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplast—
7.8.201	the site of light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.
7.8.202	These reactions actually have several names associated with them.
7.8.203	Another term, the Calvin cycle, is named for the man who discovered it, and because these reactions function as a cycle.
7.8.204	Others call it the Calvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery.
7.8.205	The most outdated name is dark reactions, because light is not directly required (Figure 8.17).
7.8.206	However, the term dark reaction can be misleading because it implies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light, which is why most scientists and instructors no longer use it.
7.8.207	Light reactions harness energy from the sun to produce chemical bonds, ATP, and NADPH.
7.8.208	These energycarrying molecules are made in the stroma where carbon fixation takes place.
7.8.209	The light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and regeneration.
7.8.210	Stage 1:
7.8.211	Fixation
7.8.212	In the stroma, in addition to CO2, two other components are present to initiate the light-independent reactions: an enzyme called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), and three molecules of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), as shown in Figure 8.18.
7.8.213	RuBP has five atoms of carbon, flanked by two phosphates.
7.8.214	RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO2 and RuBP.
7.8.215	For each CO2 molecule that reacts with one RuBP, two molecules of another compound (3-PGA) form.
7.8.216	PGA has three carbons and one phosphate.
7.8.217	Each turn of the cycle involves only one RuBP and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules of 3-PGA.
7.8.218	The number of carbon atoms remains the same, as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions (3 atoms from 3CO2 + 15 atoms from 3RuBP = 18 atoms in 3 atoms of 3-PGA).
7.8.219	This process is called carbon fixation, because CO2 is “fixed” from an inorganic form into organic molecules.
7.8.220	Stage 2:
7.8.221	Reduction ATP and NADPH are used to convert the six molecules of 3-PGA into six molecules of a chemical called glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
7.8.222	That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA.
7.8.223	Recall that a reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule.
7.8.224	Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used.
7.8.225	For ATP, energy is released with the loss of the terminal phosphate atom, converting it into ADP; for NADPH, both energy and a hydrogen atom are lost, converting it into NADP+.
7.8.226	Both of these molecules return to the nearby light-dependent reactions to be reused and reenergized.
7.8.227	Stage 3:
7.8.228	Regeneration
7.8.229	Interestingly, at this point, only one of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm to contribute to the formation of other compounds needed by the plant.
7.8.230	Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon atoms, it takes three “
7.8.231	turns” of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P.
7.8.232	But each turn makes two G3Ps, thus three turns make six G3Ps.
7.8.233	One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO2 to be fixed.
7.8.234	Three more molecules of ATP are used in these regeneration reactions.
7.8.235	The harsh conditions of the desert have led plants like these cacti to evolve variations of the lightindependent reactions of photosynthesis.
7.8.236	These variations increase the efficiency of water usage, helping to conserve water and energy.

7.8.238	The Energy Cycle
7.8.239	Whether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down carbohydrate molecules.
7.8.240	But if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down, especially when it has been shown that the gas organisms release as a “waste product” (CO2) acts as a substrate for the formation of more food in photosynthesis?
7.8.241	Remember, living things need energy to perform life functions.
7.8.242	In addition, an organism can either make its own food or eat another organism—either way, the food still needs to be broken down.
7.8.243	Finally, in the process of breaking down food, called cellular respiration, heterotrophs release needed energy and produce “waste” in the form of CO2 gas.
7.8.244	In nature, there is no such thing as waste.
7.8.245	Every single atom of matter and energy is conserved, recycling over and over infinitely.
7.8.246	Substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another, but their constituent atoms never disappear (Figure 8.20).
7.8.247	CO2 is no more a form of waste than oxygen is wasteful to photosynthesis.
7.8.248	Both are byproducts of reactions that move on to other reactions.
7.8.249	Photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular respiration releases energy by using oxygen to metabolize carbohydrates in the cytoplasm and mitochondria.
7.8.250	Both processes use electron transport chains to capture the energy necessary to drive other reactions.
7.8.251	These two powerhouse processes, photosynthesis and cellular respiration, function in biological, cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access life-sustaining energy that originates millions of miles away in a burning star humans call the sun.
7.8.252	Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.
7.8.253	Aerobic respiration consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide.
7.8.254	These two processes play an important role in the carbon cycle.
7.9.0	Have you ever become separated from a friend while in a crowd?
7.9.1	If so, you know the challenge of searching for someone when surrounded by thousands of other people.
7.9.2	If you and your friend have cell phones, your chances of finding each other are good.
7.9.3	A cell phone’s ability to send and receive messages makes it an ideal communication device.
7.9.4	Introduction Imagine what life would be like if you and the people around you could not communicate.
7.9.5	You would not be able to express your wishes to others, nor could you ask questions to find out more about your environment.
7.9.6	Social organization is dependent on communication between the individuals that comprise that society; without communication, society would fall apart.
7.9.7	As with people, it is vital for individual cells to be able to interact with their environment.
7.9.8	This is true whether a cell is growing by itself in a pond or is one of many cells that form a larger organism.
7.9.9	In order to properly respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms of communication that can receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and then produce changes within the cell in response to the message.
7.9.10	In multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly to coordinate the actions of distant organs, tissues, and cells.
7.9.11	The ability to send messages quickly and efficiently enables cells to coordinate and fine-tune their functions.
7.9.12	While the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single-celled organisms communicate with each other.
7.9.13	Yeast cells signal each other to aid mating.
7.9.14	Some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions in order to form large complexes called biofilms or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing organisms.
7.9.15	The ability of cells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the evolution of multicellular organisms.
7.9.16	The efficient and error-free function of communication systems is vital for all life as we know it.
7.9.17	There are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells.
7.9.18	Communication between cells is called intercellular signaling, and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling.
7.9.19	An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes: inter- means "between" (for example, intersecting lines are those that cross each other) and intra- means "inside" (like intravenous).
7.9.20	Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small, usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands.
7.9.21	A ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule, in some cases, delivering a signal in the process.
7.9.22	Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules.
7.9.23	Ligands interact with proteins in target cells, which are cells that are affected by chemical signals; these proteins are also called receptors.
7.9.24	Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties; however, a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand.
7.9.25	Forms of Signaling There are four categories of chemical signaling found in multicellular organisms: paracrine signaling, endocrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions (Figure 9.2).
7.9.26	The main difference between the different categories of signaling is the distance that the signal travels through the organism to reach the target cell.
7.9.27	Not all cells are affected by the same signals.
7.9.28	In chemical signaling, a cell may target itself (autocrine signaling), a cell connected by gap junctions, a nearby cell (paracrine signaling), or a distant cell (endocrine signaling).
7.9.29	Paracrine signaling acts on nearby cells, endocrine signaling uses the circulatory system to transport ligands, and autocrine signaling acts on the signaling cell.
7.9.30	Signaling via gap junctions involves signaling molecules moving directly between adjacent cells.
7.9.31	Paracrine Signaling Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals.
7.9.32	Paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix.
7.9.33	These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount of time.
7.9.34	In order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by neighboring cells.
7.9.35	Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again.
7.9.36	One example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells.
7.9.37	A nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells.
7.9.38	The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse.
7.9.39	A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells.
7.9.40	Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses.
7.9.41	When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal).
7.9.42	The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called chemical synapses (Figure 9.3).
7.9.43	The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, Take your hand off the stove!
7.9.44	When the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched.
7.9.45	The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.
7.9.46	The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell—called the synaptic gap—is very small and allows for rapid diffusion of the neurotransmitter.
7.9.47	Enzymes in the synapatic cleft degrade some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal.
7.9.48	Endocrine Signaling Signals from distant cells are called endocrine signals, and they originate from endocrine cells.
7.9.49	(In the body, many endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland.)
7.9.50	These types of signals usually produce a slower response but have a longer-lasting effect.
7.9.51	The ligands released in endocrine signaling are called hormones, signaling molecules that are produced in one part of the body but affect other body regions some distance away.
7.9.52	Hormones travel the large distances between endocrine cells and their target cells via the bloodstream, which is a relatively slow way to move throughout the body.
7.9.53	Because of their form of transport, hormones get diluted and are present in low concentrations when they act on their target cells.
7.9.54	This is different from paracrine signaling, in which local concentrations of ligands can be very high.
7.9.55	Autocrine Signaling Autocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released.
7.9.56	This means the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell (the prefix auto- means self, a reminder that the signaling cell sends a signal to itself).
7.9.57	This type of signaling often occurs during the early development of an organism to ensure that cells develop into the correct tissues and take on the proper function.
7.9.58	Autocrine signaling also regulates pain sensation and inflammatory responses.
7.9.59	Further, if a cell is infected with a virus, the cell can signal itself to undergo programmed cell death, killing the virus in the process.
7.9.60	In some cases, neighboring cells of the same type are also influenced by the released ligand.
7.9.61	In embryological development, this process of stimulating a group of neighboring cells may help to direct the differentiation of identical cells into the same cell type, thus ensuring the proper developmental outcome.
7.9.62	Direct Signaling Across Gap Junctions Gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells.
7.9.63	These water-filled channels allow small signaling molecules, called intracellular mediators, to diffuse between the two cells.
7.9.64	Small molecules, such as calcium ions (Ca2+), are able to move between cells, but large molecules like proteins and DNA cannot fit through the channels.
7.9.65	The specificity of the channels ensures that the cells remain independent but can quickly and easily transmit signals.
7.9.66	The transfer of signaling molecules communicates the current state of the cell that is directly next to the target cell; this allows a group of cells to coordinate their response to a signal that only one of them may have received.
7.9.67	In plants, plasmodesmata are ubiquitous, making the entire plant into a giant, communication network.
7.9.68	Types of Receptors Receptors are protein molecules in the target cell or on its surface that bind ligand.
7.9.69	There are two types of receptors, internal receptors and cell-surface receptors.
7.9.70	Internal receptors Internal receptors, also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors, are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane.
7.9.71	Once inside the cell, many of these molecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mRNA synthesis (transcription) to mediate gene expression.
7.9.72	Gene expression is the cellular process of transforming the information in a cell's DNA into a sequence of amino acids, which ultimately forms a protein.
7.9.73	When the ligand binds to the internal receptor, a conformational change is triggered that exposes a DNA-binding site on the protein.
7.9.74	The ligand-receptor complex moves into the nucleus, then binds to specific regulatory regions of the chromosomal DNA and promotes the initiation of transcription (Figure 9.4).
7.9.75	Transcription is the process of copying the information in a cells DNA into a special form of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA); the cell uses information in the mRNA (which moves out into the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes) to link specific amino acids in the correct order, producing a protein.
7.9.76	Internal receptors can directly influence gene expression without having to pass the signal on to other receptors or messengers.
7.9.77	Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm.
7.9.78	Many intracellular receptors are transcription factors that interact with DNA in the nucleus and regulate gene expression.
7.9.79	Cell-Surface Receptors Cell-surface receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, are cell surface, membrane-anchored (integral) proteins that bind to external ligand molecules.
7.9.80	This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction, in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal.
7.9.81	Ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do not have to enter the cell that they affect.
7.9.82	Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are specific to individual cell types.
7.9.83	Because cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences.
7.9.84	Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor molecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer.
7.9.85	Each cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic membrane- spanning region, and an intracellular domain inside the cell.
7.9.86	The ligand-binding domain is also called the extracellular domain.
7.9.87	The size and extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor.
7.9.88	Cell-surface receptors are involved in most of the signaling in multicellular organisms.
7.9.89	There are three general categories of cell-surface receptors: ion channel-linked receptors, G-protein-linked receptors, and enzyme-linked receptors.
7.9.90	Ion channel-linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through.
7.9.91	To form a channel, this type of cell-surface receptor has an extensive membrane-spanning region.
7.9.92	In order to interact with the phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma membrane, many of the amino acids in the membrane-spanning region are hydrophobic in nature.
7.9.93	Conversely, the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are hydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions.
7.9.94	When a ligand binds to the extracellular region of the channel, there is a conformational change in the proteins structure that allows ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen to pass through  
7.9.95	Gated ion channels form a pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule binds.
7.9.96	The open pore then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell.
7.9.97	G-protein-linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G-protein.
7.9.98	The activated G-protein then interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane (Figure 9.6).
7.9.99	All G-protein-linked receptors have seven transmembrane domains, but each receptor has its own specific extracellular domain and G-protein-binding site.
7.9.100	Cell signaling using G-protein-linked receptors occurs as a cyclic series of events.
7.9.101	Before the ligand binds, the inactive G- protein can bind to a newly revealed site on the receptor specific for its binding.
7.9.102	Once the G-protein binds to the receptor, the resultant shape change activates the G-protein, which releases GDP and picks up GTP.
7.9.103	The subunits of the G-protein then split into the α subunit and the βγ subunit.
7.9.104	One or both of these G-protein fragments may be able to activate other proteins as a result.
7.9.105	After awhile, the GTP on the active α subunit of the G-protein is hydrolyzed to GDP and the βγ subunit is deactivated.
7.9.106	The subunits reassociate to form the inactive G-protein and the cycle begins anew.
7.9.107	Heterotrimeric G proteins have three subunits: α, β, and γ.
7.9.108	When a signaling molecule binds to a G-protein- coupled receptor in the plasma membrane, a GDP molecule associated with the α subunit is exchanged for GTP.
7.9.109	The β and γ subunits dissociate from the α subunit, and a cellular response is triggered either by the α subunit or the dissociated βγ pair.
7.9.110	Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP terminates the signal.
7.9.111	G-protein-linked receptors have been extensively studied and much has been learned about their roles in maintaining health.
7.9.112	Bacteria that are pathogenic to humans can release poisons that interrupt specific G-protein-linked receptor function, leading to illnesses such as pertussis, botulism, and cholera.
7.9.113	In cholera (Figure 9.7), for example, the water-borne bacterium Vibrio cholerae produces a toxin, choleragen, that binds to cells lining the small intestine.
7.9.114	The toxin then enters these intestinal cells, where it modifies a G-protein that controls the opening of a chloride channel and causes it to remain continuously active, resulting in large losses of fluids from the body and potentially fatal dehydration as a result.
7.9.115	Transmitted primarily through contaminated drinking water, cholera is a major cause of death in the developing world and in areas where natural disasters interrupt the availability of clean water.
7.9.116	The cholera bacterium, Vibrio cholerae, creates a toxin that modifies G-protein-mediated cell signaling pathways in the intestines.
7.9.117	Modern sanitation eliminates the threat of cholera outbreaks, such as the one that swept through New York City in 1866.
7.9.118	This poster from that era shows how, at that time, the way that the disease was transmitted was not understood.
7.9.119	Enzyme-linked receptors are cell-surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme.
7.9.120	In some cases, the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme.
7.9.121	Other enzyme-linked receptors have a small intracellular domain that interacts directly with an enzyme.
7.9.122	The enzyme-linked receptors normally have large extracellular and intracellular domains, but the membrane-spanning region consists of a single alpha-helical region of the peptide strand.
7.9.123	When a ligand binds to the extracellular domain, a signal is transferred through the membrane, activating the enzyme.
7.9.124	Activation of the enzyme sets off a chain of events within the cell that eventually leads to a response.
7.9.125	One example of this type of enzyme-linked receptor is the tyrosine kinase receptor (Figure 9.8).
7.9.126	A kinase is an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from ATP to another protein.
7.9.127	The tyrosine kinase receptor transfers phosphate groups to tyrosine molecules (tyrosine residues).
7.9.128	First, signaling molecules bind to the extracellular domain of two nearby tyrosine kinase receptors.
7.9.129	The two neighboring receptors then bond together, or dimerize.
7.9.130	Phosphates are then added to tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of the receptors (phosphorylation).
7.9.131	The phosphorylated residues can then transmit the signal to the next messenger within the cytoplasm.
7.9.132	Signaling Molecules Produced by signaling cells and the subsequent binding to receptors in target cells, ligands act as chemical signals that travel to the target cells to coordinate responses.
7.9.133	The types of molecules that serve as ligands are incredibly varied and range from small proteins to small ions like calcium (Ca2+).
7.9.134	Small Hydrophobic Ligands Small hydrophobic ligands can directly diffuse through the plasma membrane and interact with internal receptors.
7.9.135	Important members of this class of ligands are the steroid hormones.
7.9.136	Steroids are lipids that have a hydrocarbon skeleton with four fused rings; different steroids have different functional groups attached to the carbon skeleton.
7.9.137	Steroid hormones include the female sex hormone, estradiol, which is a type of estrogen; the male sex hormone, testosterone; and cholesterol, which is an important structural component of biological membranes and a precursor of steriod hormones (Figure 9.9).
7.9.138	Other hydrophobic hormones include thyroid hormones and vitamin D.
7.9.139	In order to be soluble in blood, hydrophobic ligands must bind to carrier proteins while they are being transported through the bloodstream.
7.9.140	Steroid hormones have similar chemical structures to their precursor, cholesterol.
7.9.141	Because these molecules are small and hydrophobic, they can diffuse directly across the plasma membrane into the cell, where they interact with internal receptors.
7.9.142	Water-Soluble Ligands Water-soluble ligands are polar and therefore cannot pass through the plasma membrane unaided; sometimes, they are too large to pass through the membrane at all.
7.9.143	Instead, most water-soluble ligands bind to the extracellular domain of cell- surface receptors.
7.9.144	This group of ligands is quite diverse and includes small molecules, peptides, and proteins.
7.9.145	Other Ligands Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that also acts as a ligand.
7.9.146	It is able to diffuse directly across the plasma membrane, and one of its roles is to interact with receptors in smooth muscle and induce relaxation of the tissue.
7.9.147	NO has a very short half-life and therefore only functions over short distances.
7.9.148	Nitroglycerin, a treatment for heart disease, acts by triggering the release of NO, which causes blood vessels to dilate (expand), thus restoring blood flow to the heart.
7.9.149	NO has become better known recently because the pathway that it affects is targeted by prescription medications for erectile dysfunction, such as Viagra (erection involves dilated blood vessels).
7.9.150	Once a ligand binds to a receptor, the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm.
7.9.151	Continuation of a signal in this manner is called signal transduction.
7.9.152	Signal transduction only occurs with cell-surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with DNA in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis.
7.9.153	When a ligand binds to its receptor, conformational changes occur that affect the receptor’s intracellular domain.
7.9.154	Conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins.
7.9.155	In some cases, binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor, which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer.
7.9.156	A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules (often identical) join together.
7.9.157	The binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other.
7.9.158	Binding Initiates a Signaling Pathway
7.9.159	After the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the receptor’s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade.
7.9.160	In a signaling pathway, second messengers, enzymes, and activated proteins interact with specific proteins, which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cell’s environment (Figure 9.10).
7.9.161	The events in the cascade occur in a series, much like a current flows in a river.
7.9.162	Interactions that occur before a certain point are defined as upstream events, and events after that point are called downstream events.
7.9.163	Signaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most cellular proteins can affect different downstream events, depending on the conditions within the cell.
7.9.164	A single pathway can branch off toward different endpoints based on the interplay between two or more signaling pathways, and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals in different cell types.
7.9.165	This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types.
7.9.166	Another complicating element is signal integration of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different cell-surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell.
7.9.167	This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response.
7.9.168	The effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades.
7.9.169	At the initiation of the signal, a single ligand binds to a single receptor.
7.9.170	However, activation of a receptor-linked enzyme can activate many copies of a component of the signaling cascade, which amplifies the signal.
7.9.171	Methods of
7.9.172	Intracellular Signaling
7.9.173	The induction of a signaling pathway depends on the modification of a cellular component by an enzyme.
7.9.174	There are numerous enzymatic modifications that can occur, and they are recognized in turn by the next component downstream.
7.9.175	The following are some of the more common events in intracellular signaling.
7.9.176	Phosphorylation One of the most common chemical modifications that occurs in signaling pathways is the addition of a phosphate group (PO4–3) to a molecule such as a protein in a process called phosphorylation.
7.9.177	The phosphate can be added to a nucleotide such as GMP to form GDP or GTP.
7.9.178	Phosphates are also often added to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of proteins, where they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid (Figure 9.11).
7.9.179	The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a kinase.
7.9.180	Various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate.
7.9.181	Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues often activates enzymes.
7.9.182	Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme or create a binding site that interacts with downstream components in the signaling cascade.
7.9.183	Phosphorylation may activate or inactivate enzymes, and the reversal of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, will reverse the effect.
7.9.184	In protein phosphorylation, a phosphate group (PO4-3 ) is added to residues of the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine.
7.9.185	Second
7.9.186	Messengers Second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor.
7.9.187	These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins.
7.9.188	Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger.
7.9.189	The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it.
7.9.190	For signaling purposes, Ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell.
7.9.191	When signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2
7.9.192	+.
7.9.193	The response to the increase in Ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved.
7.9.194	For example, in the β-cells of the pancreas, Ca2+ signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca2+ leads to muscle contractions.
7.9.195	Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP (cAMP).
7.9.196	Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 9.12).
7.9.197	The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase).
7.9.198	A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process.
7.9.199	A-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different.
7.9.200	Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP in different cells.
7.9.201	This diagram shows the mechanism for the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP).
7.9.202	cAMP serves as a second messenger to activate or inactivate proteins within the cell.
7.9.203	Termination of the signal occurs when an enzyme called phosphodiesterase converts cAMP into AMP.
7.9.204	Present in small concentrations in the plasma membrane, inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted into second messengers.
7.9.205	Because these molecules are membrane components, they are located near membrane-bound receptors and can easily interact with them.
7.9.206	Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is the main phospholipid that plays a role in cellular signaling.
7.9.207	Enzymes known as kinases phosphorylate PI to form PI-phosphate (PIP) and PI-bisphosphate (PIP2).
7.9.208	The enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) (Figure 9.13).
7.9.209	These products of the cleavage of PIP2 serve as second messengers.
7.9.210	Diacylglycerol (DAG) remains in the plasma membrane and activates protein kinase C (PKC), which then phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in its target proteins.
7.9.211	IP3 diffuses into the cytoplasm and binds to ligand-gated calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2
7.9.212	+ that continues the signal cascade.
7.9.213	The enzyme phospholipase C breaks down PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, both of which serve as second messengers.
7.9.214	Inside the cell, ligands bind to their internal receptors, allowing them to directly affect the cell’s DNA and protein-producing machinery.
7.9.215	Using signal transduction pathways, receptors in the plasma membrane produce a variety of effects on the cell.
7.9.216	The results of signaling pathways are extremely varied and depend on the type of cell involved as well as the external and internal conditions.
7.9.217	A small sampling of responses is described below.
7.9.218	Gene Expression
7.9.219	Some signal transduction pathways regulate the transcription of RNA.
7.9.220	Others regulate the translation of proteins from mRNA.
7.9.221	An example of a protein that regulates translation in the nucleus is the MAP kinase ERK.
7.9.222	ERK is activated in a phosphorylation cascade when epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds the EGF receptor (see Figure 9.10).
7.9.223	Upon phosphorylation, ERK enters the nucleus and activates a protein kinase that, in turn, regulates protein translation (Figure 9.14).
7.9.224	ERK is a MAP kinase that activates translation when it is phosphorylated.
7.9.225	ERK phosphorylates MNK1, which in turn phosphorylates eIF-4E, an elongation initiation factor that, with other initiation factors, is associated with mRNA.
7.9.226	When eIF-4E becomes phosphorylated, the mRNA unfolds, allowing protein synthesis in the nucleus to begin.
7.9.227	The second kind of protein with which PKC can interact is a protein that acts as an inhibitor.
7.9.228	An inhibitor is a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function.
7.9.229	In this case, the inhibitor is a protein called Iκ-B, which binds to the regulatory protein NF-κB. (The symbol κ represents the Greek letter kappa.)
7.9.230	When Iκ-B is bound to NF-κB, the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell, but when Iκ-B is phosphorylated by PKC, it can no longer bind NF-κB, and NF-κB (a transcription factor) can enter the nucleus and initiate RNA transcription.
7.9.231	In this case, the effect of phosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor and thereby activate the process of transcription.
7.9.232	Increase in Cellular Metabolism
7.9.233	The result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells.
7.9.234	The activation of β-adrenergic receptors in muscle cells by adrenaline leads to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) inside the cell.
7.9.235	Also known as epinephrine, adrenaline is a hormone (produced by the adrenal gland attached to the kidney) that readies the body for short-term emergencies.
7.9.236	Cyclic AMP activates PKA (protein kinase A), which in turn phosphorylates two enzymes.
7.9.237	The first enzyme promotes the degradation of glycogen by activating intermediate glycogen phosphorylase kinase (GPK) that in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase (GP) that catabolizes glycogen into glucose.
7.9.238	(Recall that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for short-term storage.
7.9.239	When energy is needed, glycogen is quickly reconverted to glucose.)
7.9.240	Phosphorylation of the second enzyme, glycogen synthase (GS), inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose.
7.9.241	In this manner, a muscle cell obtains a ready pool of glucose by activating its formation via glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of glucose to form glycogen, thus preventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and synthesis.
7.9.242	The glucose is then available for use by the muscle cell in response to a sudden surge of adrenaline—the “fight or flight” reflex.
7.9.243	Cell Growth Cell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division.
7.9.244	Cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals from other cells.
7.9.245	The ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors.
7.9.246	Most growth factors bind to cell-surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases.
7.9.247	These cell-surface receptors are called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).
7.9.248	Activation of RTKs initiates a signaling pathway that includes a G-protein called RAS, which activates the MAP kinase pathway described earlier.
7.9.249	The enzyme MAP kinase then stimulates the expression of proteins that interact with other cellular components to initiate cell division.
7.9.250	Cell Death
7.9.251	When a cell is damaged, superfluous, or potentially dangerous to an organism, a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger programmed cell death, or apoptosis.
7.9.252	Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell.
7.9.253	There are many internal checkpoints that monitor a cell’s health; if abnormalities are observed, a cell can spontaneously initiate the process of apoptosis.
7.9.254	However, in some cases, such as a viral infection or uncontrolled cell division due to cancer, the cell’s normal checks and balances fail.
7.9.255	External signaling can also initiate apoptosis.
7.9.256	For example, most normal animal cells have receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix, a network of glycoproteins that provides structural support for cells in an organism.
7.9.257	The binding of cellular receptors to the extracellular matrix initiates a signaling cascade within the cell.
7.9.258	However, if the cell moves away from the extracellular matrix, the signaling ceases, and the cell undergoes apoptosis.
7.9.259	This system keeps cells from traveling through the body and proliferating out of control, as happens with tumor cells that metastasize.
7.9.260	Another example of external signaling that leads to apoptosis occurs in T-cell development.
7.9.261	T-cells are immune cells that bind to foreign macromolecules and particles, and target them for destruction by the immune system.
7.9.262	Normally, T-cells do not target “self” proteins (those of their own organism), a process that can lead to autoimmune diseases.
7.9.263	In order to develop the ability to discriminate between self and non-self, immature T-cells undergo screening to determine whether they bind to so-called self proteins.
7.9.264	If the T-cell receptor binds to self proteins, the cell initiates apoptosis to remove the potentially dangerous cell.
7.9.265	Apoptosis is also essential for normal embryological development.
7.9.266	In vertebrates, for example, early stages of development include the formation of web-like tissue between individual fingers and toes (Figure 9.15).
7.9.267	During the course of normal development, these unneeded cells must be eliminated, enabling fully separated fingers and toes to form.
7.9.268	A cell signaling mechanism triggers apoptosis, which destroys the cells between the developing digits.
7.9.269	The histological section of a foot of a 15-day-old mouse embryo, visualized using light microscopy, reveals areas of tissue between the toes, which apoptosis will eliminate before the mouse reaches its full gestational age at 27 days.
7.9.270	(credit: modification of work by Michal Mañas)
7.9.271	Termination of the Signal Cascade
7.9.272	The aberrant signaling often seen in tumor cells is proof that the termination of a signal at the appropriate time can be just as important as the initiation of a signal.
7.9.273	One method of stopping a specific signal is to degrade the ligand or remove it so that it can no longer access its receptor.
7.9.274	One reason that hydrophobic hormones like estrogen and testosterone trigger
7.9.275	long- lasting events is because they bind carrier proteins.
7.9.276	These proteins allow the insoluble molecules to be soluble in blood, but they also protect the hormones from degradation by circulating enzymes.
7.9.277	Inside the cell, many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades.
7.9.278	For example, phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation.
7.9.279	Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is degraded into AMP by phosphodiesterase, and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the Ca2+ pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell.
7.9.280	Within-cell signaling allows bacteria to respond to environmental cues, such as nutrient levels, some single-celled organisms also release molecules to signal to each other.
7.9.281	Signaling in Yeast Yeasts are eukaryotes (fungi), and the components and processes found in yeast signals are similar to those of cell-surface receptor signals in multicellular organisms.
7.9.282	Budding yeasts (Figure 9.16) are able to participate in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells (cells with one-half the normal number of chromosomes) combining to form a diploid cell (a cell with two sets of each chromosome, which is what normal body cells contain).
7.9.283	In order to find another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate, budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor.
7.9.284	When mating factor binds to cell-surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby, they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins that are similar to G-proteins.
7.9.285	Budding Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells can communicate by releasing a signaling molecule called mating factor.
7.9.286	In this micrograph, they are visualized using differential interference contrast microscopy, a light microscopy technique that enhances the contrast of the sample.
7.9.287	Signaling in Bacteria Signaling in bacteria enables bacteria to monitor extracellular conditions, ensure that there are sufficient amounts of nutrients, and ensure that hazardous situations are avoided.
7.9.288	There are circumstances, however, when bacteria communicate with each other.
7.9.289	The first evidence of bacterial communication was observed in a bacterium that has a symbiotic relationship with Hawaiian bobtail squid.
7.9.290	When the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level, specific gene expression is initiated, and the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light.
7.9.291	Because the number of cells present in the environment (cell density) is the determining factor for signaling, bacterial signaling was named quorum sensing.
7.9.292	In politics and business, a quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue.
7.9.293	Quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules.
7.9.294	Autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind.
7.9.295	The secreted autoinducers can be small, hydrophobic molecules such as acyl-homoserine lactone, (AHL) or larger peptide-based molecules; each type of molecule has a different mode of action.
7.9.296	When AHL enters target bacteria, it binds to transcription factors, which then switch gene expression on or off (Figure 9.17).
7.9.297	The peptide autoinducers stimulate more complicated signaling pathways that include bacterial kinases.
7.9.298	The changes in bacteria following exposure to autoinducers can be quite extensive.
7.9.299	The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has 616 different genes that respond to autoinducers.
7.9.300	Some species of bacteria that use quorum sensing form biofilms, complex colonies of bacteria (often containing several species) that exchange chemical signals to coordinate the release of toxins that will attack the host.
7.9.301	Bacterial biofilms (Figure 9.18) can sometimes be found on medical equipment; when biofilms invade implants such as hip or knee replacements or heart pacemakers, they can cause life-threatening infections.
7.9.302	Research on the details of quorum sensing has led to advances in growing bacteria for industrial purposes.
7.9.303	Recent discoveries suggest that it may be possible to exploit bacterial signaling pathways to control bacterial growth; this process could replace or supplement antibiotics that are no longer effective in certain situations.
7.10.0	Introduction A human, as well as every sexually reproducing organism, begins life as a fertilized egg (embryo) or zygote.
7.10.1	Trillions of cell divisions subsequently occur in a controlled manner to produce a complex, multicellular human.
7.10.2	In other words, that original single cell is the ancestor of every other cell in the body.
7.10.3	Once a being is fully grown, cell reproduction is still necessary to repair or regenerate tissues.
7.10.4	For example, new blood and skin cells are constantly being produced.
7.10.5	All multicellular organisms use cell division for growth and the maintenance and repair of cells and tissues.
7.10.6	Cell division is tightly regulated, and the occasional failure of regulation can have life-threatening consequences.
7.10.7	Single-celled organisms use cell division as their method of reproduction.
7.10.8	The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle.
7.10.9	The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell’s life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells.
7.10.10	The mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated.
7.10.11	Genomic DNA
7.10.12	Before discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate, a deeper understanding of the structure and function of a cell’s genetic information is necessary.
7.10.13	A cell’s DNA, packaged as a double-stranded DNA molecule, is called its genome.
7.10.14	In prokaryotes, the genome is composed of a single, double-stranded DNA molecule in the form of a loop or circle (Figure 10.2).
7.10.15	The region in the cell containing this genetic material is called a nucleoid.
7.10.16	Some prokaryotes also have smaller loops of DNA called plasmids that are not essential for normal growth.
7.10.17	Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria, sometimes receiving beneficial new genes that the recipient can add to their chromosomal DNA.
7.10.18	Antibiotic resistance is one trait that often spreads through a bacterial colony through plasmid exchange.
7.10.19	Prokaryotes, including bacteria and archaea, have a single, circular chromosome located in a central region called the nucleoid.
7.10.20	In eukaryotes, the genome consists of several double-stranded linear DNA molecules (Figure 10.3).
7.10.21	Each species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells.
7.10.22	Human body cells have 46 chromosomes, while human gametes (sperm or eggs) have 23 chromosomes each.
7.10.23	A typical body cell, or somatic cell, contains two matched sets of chromosomes, a configuration known as diploid.
7.10.24	The letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes; therefore, a diploid organism is designated 2n.
7.10.25	Human cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called gametes, or sex cells; these are eggs and sperm, and are designated 1n, or haploid.
7.10.26	There are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell.
7.10.27	The condensed chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus (top), removed from a cell in mitosis and spread out on a slide (right), and artificially arranged according to length (left); an arrangement like this is called a karyotype.
7.10.28	In this image, the chromosomes were exposed to fluorescent stains for differentiation of the different chromosomes.
7.10.29	A method of staining called “chromosome painting
7.10.30	” employs fluorescent dyes that highlight chromosomes in different colors.
7.10.31	Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous (“same knowledge”) chromosomes.
7.10.32	Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location, or locus.
7.10.33	Genes, the functional units of chromosomes, determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins.
7.10.34	Traits are the variations of those characteristics.
7.10.35	For example, hair color is a characteristic with traits that are blonde, brown, or black.
7.10.36	Each copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent; therefore, the genes themselves are not identical.
7.10.37	The variation of individuals within a species is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from both parents.
7.10.38	Even a slightly altered sequence of nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait.
7.10.39	For example, there are three possible gene sequences on the human chromosome that code for blood type:
7.10.40	sequence A, sequence B, and sequence O.
7.10.41	Because all diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood type (the trait) is determined by which two versions of the marker gene are inherited.
7.10.42	It is possible to have two copies of the same gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes, with one on each (for example, AA, BB, or OO), or two different sequences, such as AB.
7.10.43	Minor variations of traits, such as blood type, eye color, and handedness, contribute to the natural variation found within a species.
7.10.44	However, if the entire DNA sequence from any pair of human homologous chromosomes is compared, the difference is less than one percent.
7.10.45	The sex chromosomes, X and Y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous chromosome uniformity:
7.10.46	Other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to accurately produce gametes, the genes found on the X and Y chromosomes are different.
7.10.47	Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction
7.10.48	If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm.
7.10.49	Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 μm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus.
7.10.50	At the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed.
7.10.51	During some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes.
7.10.52	There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted.
7.10.53	In the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (Figure 10.4).
7.10.54	The DNA-histone complex is called chromatin.
7.10.55	The beadlike, histone DNA complex is called a nucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA.
7.10.56	A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix.
7.10.57	The next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber.
7.10.58	This coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form.
7.10.59	In the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin.
7.10.60	These fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome.
7.10.61	Double-stranded DNA wraps around histone proteins to form nucleosomes that have the appearance of “beads on a string.
7.10.62	”
7.10.63	The nucleosomes are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber.
7.10.64	When a cell undergoes mitosis, the chromosomes condense even further.
7.10.65	DNA replicates in the S phase of interphase.
7.10.66	After replication, the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids.
7.10.67	When fully compact, the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins.
7.10.68	The connection between the sister chromatids is closest in a region called the centromere.
7.10.69	The conjoined sister chromatids, with a diameter of about 1 μm, are visible under a light microscope.
7.10.70	The centromeric region is highly condensed and thus will appear as a constricted area.
7.10.71	The cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells.
7.10.72	Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication, and division that produces two identical (clone) cells.
7.10.73	The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase (Figure 10.5).
7.10.74	During interphase, the cell grows and DNA is replicated.
7.10.75	During the mitotic phase, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell divides.
7.10.76	The cell cycle consists of interphase and the mitotic phase.
7.10.77	During interphase, the cell grows and the nuclear DNA is duplicated.
7.10.78	Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase.
7.10.79	During the mitotic phase, the duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei.
7.10.80	The cytoplasm is usually divided as well, resulting in two daughter cells.
7.10.81	Interphase
7.10.82	During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division.
7.10.83	In order for a cell to move from interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met.
7.10.84	The three stages of interphase are called G1, S, and G2.
7.10.85	G1
7.10.86	Phase (First Gap)
7.10.87	The first stage of interphase is called the G1 phase (first gap) because, from a microscopic aspect, little change is visible.
7.10.88	However, during the G1 stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level.
7.10.89	The cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.
7.10.90	S Phase (Synthesis of DNA)
7.10.91	Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration.
7.10.92	In the S phase, DNA replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules—sister chromatids—that are firmly attached to the centromeric region.
7.10.93	The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase.
7.10.94	The two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis.
7.10.95	At the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod-like objects, the centrioles, which are at right angles to each other.
7.10.96	Centrioles help organize cell division.
7.10.97	Centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of other eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi.
7.10.98	G2 Phase (Second Gap)
7.10.99	In the G2 phase, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation.
7.10.100	Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase.
7.10.101	There may be additional cell growth during G2.
7.10.102	The final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the first stage of mitosis.
7.10.103	The Mitotic Phase
7.10.104	The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and move into two new, identical daughter cells.
7.10.105	The first portion of the mitotic phase is called karyokinesis, or nuclear division.
7.10.106	The second portion of the mitotic phase, called cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into the two daughter cells.
7.10.107	Karyokinesis (Mitosis) Karyokinesis, also known as mitosis, is divided into a series of phases—prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase—that result in the division of the cell nucleus (Figure 10.6).
7.10.108	Karyokinesis is also called mitosis.
7.10.109	During prophase, the “first phase,” the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles, and the membranous organelles (such as the Golgi complex or Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum), fragment and disperse toward the periphery of the cell.
7.10.110	The nucleolus disappears (disperses).
7.10.111	The centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the cell.
7.10.112	Microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen.
7.10.113	The sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of condensin proteins and become visible under a light microscope.
7.10.114	During prometaphase, the “first change phase,” many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance.
7.10.115	The remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment.
7.10.116	The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and stretch across the length of the former nuclear area.
7.10.117	Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete.
7.10.118	Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region (Figure 10.7).
7.10.119	The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules.
7.10.120	As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes, some of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores.
7.10.121	Once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome, the chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles.
7.10.122	Eventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles.
7.10.123	Spindle microtubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules.
7.10.124	These microtubules overlap each other midway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation.
7.10.125	Astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in spindle orientation, and are required for the regulation of mitosis.
7.10.126	During prometaphase, mitotic spindle microtubules from opposite poles attach to each sister chromatid at the kinetochore.
7.10.127	In anaphase, the connection between the sister chromatids breaks down, and the microtubules pull the chromosomes toward opposite poles.
7.10.128	During metaphase, the “change phase,” all the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate, or the equatorial plane, midway between the two poles of the cell.
7.10.129	The sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by cohesin proteins.
7.10.130	At this time, the chromosomes are maximally condensed.
7.10.131	During anaphase, the “upward phase,” the cohesin proteins degrade, and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere.
7.10.132	Each chromatid, now called a chromosome, is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached.
7.10.133	The cell becomes visibly elongated (oval shaped) as the polar microtubules slide against each other at the metaphase plate where they overlap.
7.10.134	During telophase, the “distance phase,” the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel), relaxing into a chromatin configuration.
7.10.135	The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell.
7.10.136	Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes, and nucleosomes appear within the nuclear area.
7.10.137	Cytokinesis Cytokinesis, or “cell motion,” is the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells.
7.10.138	Division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells.
7.10.139	Although the stages of mitosis are similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant cells.
7.10.140	In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis follows the onset of anaphase.
7.10.141	A contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate.
7.10.142	The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure.
7.10.143	This fissure, or “crack
7.10.144	,” is called the cleavage furrow.
7.10.145	The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two (Figure 10.8).
7.10.146	In plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells.
7.10.147	During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell.
7.10.148	During telophase, these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast (a vesicular structure) at the metaphase plate.
7.10.149	There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a cell plate.
7.10.150	As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell.
7.10.151	Enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall.
7.10.152	The Golgi membranes become parts of the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall.
7.10.153	During cytokinesis in animal cells, a ring of actin filaments forms at the metaphase plate.
7.10.154	The ring contracts, forming a cleavage furrow, which divides the cell in two.
7.10.155	In plant cells, Golgi vesicles coalesce at the former metaphase plate, forming a phragmoplast.
7.10.156	A cell plate formed by the fusion of the vesicles of the phragmoplast grows from the center toward the cell walls, and the membranes of the vesicles fuse to form a plasma membrane that divides the cell in two.
7.10.157	G0
7.10.158	Phase Not all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory phases of interphase, closely followed by the mitotic phase.
7.10.159	Cells in G0 phase are not actively preparing to divide.
7.10.160	The cell is in a quiescent (inactive) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle.
7.10.161	Some cells enter G0 temporarily until an external signal triggers the onset of G1.
7.10.162	Other cells that never or rarely divide, such as mature cardiac muscle and nerve cells, remain in G0 permanently.
7.10.163	The length of the cell cycle is highly variable, even within the cells of a single organism.
7.10.164	In humans, the frequency of cell turnover ranges from a few hours in early embryonic development, to an average of two to five days for epithelial cells, and to an entire human lifetime spent in G0 by specialized cells, such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells.
7.10.165	There is also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle.
7.10.166	When fast-dividing mammalian cells are grown in culture (outside the body under optimal growing conditions), the length of the cycle is about 24 hours.
7.10.167	In rapidly dividing human cells with a 24-hour cell cycle, the G1 phase lasts approximately nine hours, the S phase lasts 10 hours, the G2 phase lasts about four and one-half hours, and the M phase lasts approximately one-half hour.
7.10.168	In early embryos of fruit flies, the cell cycle is completed in about eight minutes.
7.10.169	The timing of events in the cell cycle is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell.
7.10.170	Regulation of the Cell Cycle by External Events
7.10.171	Both the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to begin the replication process.
7.10.172	An event may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the release of growthpromoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH).
7.10.173	A lack of HGH can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism, whereas too much HGH can result in gigantism.
7.10.174	Crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division.
7.10.175	Another factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing surface-tovolume ratio.
7.10.176	The solution to this problem is to divide.
7.10.177	Whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase.
7.10.178	Moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress.
7.10.179	Regulation at Internal Checkpoints
7.10.180	It is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the parent cell.
7.10.181	Mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal cell.
7.10.182	To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell cycle checkpoints.
7.10.183	A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable.
7.10.184	These checkpoints occur near the end of G1, at the G2/M transition, and during metaphase.
7.10.185	The cell cycle is controlled at three checkpoints.
7.10.186	The integrity of the DNA is assessed at the G1 checkpoint.
7.10.187	Proper chromosome duplication is assessed at the G2 checkpoint.
7.10.188	Attachment of each kinetochore to a spindle fiber is assessed at the M checkpoint.
7.10.189	The G1 Checkpoint
7.10.190	The G1 checkpoint determines whether all conditions are favorable for cell division to proceed.
7.10.191	The G1 checkpoint, also called the restriction point (in yeast), is a point at which the cell irreversibly commits to the cell division process.
7.10.192	External influences, such as growth factors, play a large role in carrying the cell past the G1 checkpoint.
7.10.193	In addition to adequate reserves and cell size, there is a check for genomic DNA damage at the G1 checkpoint.
7.10.194	A cell that does not meet all the requirements will not be allowed to progress into the S phase.
7.10.195	The cell can halt the cycle and attempt to remedy the problematic condition, or the cell can advance into G0 and await further signals when conditions improve.
7.10.196	The G2 Checkpoint The G2 checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are not met.
7.10.197	As at the G1 checkpoint, cell size and protein reserves are assessed.
7.10.198	However, the most important role of the G2 checkpoint is to ensure that all of the chromosomes have been replicated and that the replicated DNA is not damaged.
7.10.199	If the checkpoint mechanisms detect problems with the DNA, the cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA replication or repair the damaged DNA.
7.10.200	The M Checkpoint The M checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of karyokinesis.
7.10.201	The M checkpoint is also known as the spindle checkpoint, because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules.
7.10.202	Because the separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not proceed until the kinetochores of each pair of sister chromatids are firmly anchored to at least two spindle fibers arising from opposite poles of the cell.
7.10.203	Regulator Molecules of the Cell Cycle
7.10.204	In addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate the cell cycle.
7.10.205	These regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation) or halt the cycle (negative regulation).
7.10.206	Regulator molecules may act individually, or they can influence the activity or production of other regulatory proteins.
7.10.207	Therefore, the failure of a single regulator may have almost no effect on the cell cycle, especially if more than one mechanism controls the same event.
7.10.208	Conversely, the effect of a deficient or non-functioning regulator can be wide-ranging and possibly fatal to the cell if multiple processes are affected.
7.10.209	Positive Regulation of the Cell Cycle
7.10.210	Two groups of proteins, called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints.
7.10.211	The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable pattern (Figure 10.11).
7.10.212	Increases in the concentration of cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and internal signals.
7.10.213	After the cell moves to the next stage of the cell cycle, the cyclins that were active in the previous stage are degraded.
7.10.214	The concentrations of cyclin proteins change throughout the cell cycle.
7.10.215	There is a direct correlation between cyclin accumulation and the three major cell cycle checkpoints.
7.10.216	Also note the sharp decline of cyclin levels following each checkpoint (the transition between phases of the cell cycle), as cyclin is degraded by cytoplasmic enzymes.
7.10.217	Cyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks.
7.10.218	To be fully active, the Cdk/cyclin complex must also be phosphorylated in specific locations.
7.10.219	Like all kinases, Cdks are enzymes (kinases) that phosphorylate other proteins.
7.10.220	Phosphorylation activates the protein by changing its shape.
7.10.221	The proteins phosphorylated by Cdks are involved in advancing the cell to the next phase.
7.10.222	(Figure 10.12).
7.10.223	The levels of Cdk proteins are relatively stable throughout the cell cycle; however, the concentrations of cyclin fluctuate and determine when Cdk/cyclin complexes form.
7.10.224	The different cyclins and Cdks bind at specific points in the cell cycle and thus regulate different checkpoints.
7.10.225	Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are protein kinases that, when fully activated, can phosphorylate and thus activate other proteins that advance the cell cycle past a checkpoint.
7.10.226	To become fully activated, a Cdk must bind to a cyclin protein and then be phosphorylated by another kinase.
7.10.227	Since the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are based on the timing of the cell cycle and not on specific events, regulation of the cell cycle usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or the Cdk/cyclin complexes.
7.10.228	Without a specific concentration of fully activated cyclin/Cdk complexes, the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints.
7.10.229	Although the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle, there are several other mechanisms that fine-tune the progress of the cycle with negative, rather than positive, effects.
7.10.230	These mechanisms essentially block the progression of the cell cycle until problematic conditions are resolved.
7.10.231	Molecules that prevent the full activation of Cdks are called Cdk inhibitors.
7.10.232	Many of these inhibitor molecules directly or indirectly monitor a particular cell cycle event.
7.10.233	The block placed on Cdks by inhibitor molecules will not be removed until the specific event that the inhibitor monitors is completed.
7.10.234	Negative Regulation of the Cell Cycle
7.10.235	The second group of cell cycle regulatory molecules are negative regulators.
7.10.236	Negative regulators halt the cell cycle.
7.10.237	Remember that in positive regulation, active molecules cause the cycle to progress.
7.10.238	The best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein (Rb), p53, and p21.
7.10.239	Retinoblastoma proteins are a group of tumor-suppressor proteins common in many cells.
7.10.240	The 53 and 21 designations refer to the functional molecular masses of the proteins (p) in kilodaltons.
7.10.241	Much of what is known about cell cycle regulation comes from research conducted with cells that have lost regulatory control.
7.10.242	All three of these regulatory proteins were discovered to be damaged or non-functional in cells that had begun to replicate uncontrollably (became cancerous).
7.10.243	In each case, the main cause of the unchecked progress through the cell cycle was a faulty copy of the regulatory protein.
7.10.244	Rb, p53, and p21 act primarily at the G1 checkpoint.
7.10.245	p53 is a multi-functional protein that has a major impact on the commitment of a cell to division because it acts when there is damaged DNA in cells that are undergoing the preparatory processes during G1.
7.10.246	If damaged DNA is detected, p53 halts the cell cycle and recruits enzymes to repair the DNA.
7.10.247	If the DNA cannot be repaired, p53 can trigger apoptosis, or cell suicide, to prevent the duplication of damaged chromosomes.
7.10.248	As p53 levels rise, the production of p21 is triggered.
7.10.249	p21 enforces the halt in the cycle dictated by p53 by binding to and inhibiting the activity of the Cdk/cyclin complexes.
7.10.250	As a cell is exposed to more stress, higher levels of p53 and p21 accumulate, making it less likely that the cell will move into the S phase.
7.10.251	Rb exerts its regulatory influence on other positive regulator proteins.
7.10.252	Chiefly, Rb monitors cell size.
7.10.253	In the active, dephosphorylated state, Rb binds to proteins called transcription factors, most commonly, E2F (Figure 10.13).
7.10.254	Transcription factors
7.10.255	“turn on” specific genes, allowing the production of proteins encoded by that gene.
7.10.256	When Rb is bound to E2F, production of proteins necessary for the G1/S transition is blocked.
7.10.257	As the cell increases in size, Rb is slowly phosphorylated until it becomes inactivated.
7.10.258	Rb releases E2F, which can now turn on the gene that produces the transition protein, and this particular block is removed.
7.10.259	For the cell to move past each of the checkpoints, all positive regulators must be “turned on,” and all negative regulators must be
7.10.260	“turned off.
7.10.261	”
7.10.262	Cancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth.
7.10.263	Despite the redundancy and overlapping levels of cell cycle control, errors do occur.
7.10.264	One of the critical processes monitored by the cell cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase.
7.10.265	Even when all of the cell cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells.
7.10.266	If changes to the DNA nucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected, a gene mutation results.
7.10.267	All cancers start when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction.
7.10.268	The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in the binding of Cdk to cyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated.
7.10.269	Even minor mistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily.
7.10.270	Over and over, small uncorrected errors are passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage.
7.10.271	Eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases.
7.10.272	Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor (“-oma”) can result.
7.10.273	Proto-oncogenes
7.10.274	The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto-oncogenes.
7.10.275	Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that, when mutated in certain ways, become oncogenes, genes that cause a cell to become cancerous.
7.10.276	Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene.
7.10.277	In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a less functional (or non-functional) protein.
7.10.278	The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing the cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward.
7.10.279	If a cell cannot reproduce, the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal.
7.10.280	Occasionally, however, a gene mutation causes a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator.
7.10.281	For example, a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated without being partnered with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met.
7.10.282	If the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated and no harm would come to the organism.
7.10.283	However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions, subsequent generations of cells will probably accumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle.
7.10.284	The Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes.
7.10.285	In addition to the cell cycle regulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell cycle checkpoints.
7.10.286	An oncogene is any gene that, when altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell cycle progression.
7.10.287	Tumor Suppressor Genes
7.10.288	Like proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous.
7.10.289	Tumor suppressor genes are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins, the type of regulators that, when activated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division.
7.10.290	The collective function of the bestunderstood tumor suppressor gene proteins, Rb, p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain events are completed.
7.10.291	A cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem.
7.10.292	Tumor suppressors are similar to brakes in a vehicle: Malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash.
7.10.293	Mutated p53 genes have been identified in more than one-half of all human tumor cells.
7.10.294	This discovery is not surprising in light of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the G1 checkpoint.
7.10.295	A cell with a faulty p53 may fail to detect errors present in the genomic DNA (Figure 10.14).
7.10.296	Even if a partially functional p53 does identify the mutations, it may no longer be able to signal the necessary DNA repair enzymes.
7.10.297	Either way, damaged DNA will remain uncorrected.
7.10.298	At this point, a functional p53 will deem the cell unsalvageable and trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis).
7.10.299	The damaged version of p53 found in cancer cells, however, cannot trigger apoptosis.
7.10.300	The loss of p53 function has other repercussions for the cell cycle.
7.10.301	Mutated p53 might lose its ability to trigger p21 production.
7.10.302	Without adequate levels of p21, there is no effective block on Cdk activation.
7.10.303	Essentially, without a fully functional p53, the G1 checkpoint is severely compromised and the cell proceeds directly from G1 to S regardless of internal and external conditions.
7.10.304	At the completion of this shortened cell cycle, two daughter cells are produced that have inherited the mutated p53 gene.
7.10.305	Given the non-optimal conditions under which the parent cell reproduced, it is likely that the daughter cells will have acquired other mutations in addition to the faulty tumor suppressor gene.
7.10.306	Cells such as these daughter cells quickly accumulate both oncogenes and non-functional tumor suppressor genes.
7.10.307	Again, the result is tumor growth.
7.10.308	Prokaryotes, such as bacteria, propagate by binary fission.
7.10.309	For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to produce new individuals.
7.10.310	In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.
7.10.311	In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals.
7.10.312	To achieve the outcome of cloned offspring, certain steps are essential.
7.10.313	The genomic DNA must be replicated and then allocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to sustain life.
7.10.314	In bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular DNA chromosome; therefore, the process of cell division is simplified.
7.10.315	Karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell.
7.10.316	This type of cell division is called binary (prokaryotic) fission.
7.10.317	Binary Fission Due to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes, the cell division process, called binary fission, is a less complicated and much more rapid process than cell division in eukaryotes.
7.10.318	The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2).
7.10.319	Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes.
7.10.320	The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes.
7.10.321	The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell.
7.10.322	The starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15).
7.10.323	Replication of the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously.
7.10.324	As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell.
7.10.325	As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes.
7.10.326	After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins.
7.10.327	The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids.
7.10.328	Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site.
7.10.329	A septum is formed between the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell.
7.10.330	When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.
7.11.0	Introduction
7.11.1	The ability to reproduce in kind is a basic characteristic of all living things.
7.11.2	In kind means that the offspring of any organism closely resemble their parent or parents.
7.11.3	Hippopotamuses give birth to hippopotamus calves, Joshua trees produce seeds from which Joshua tree seedlings emerge, and adult flamingos lay eggs that hatch into flamingo chicks.
7.11.4	In kind does not generally mean exactly the same.
7.11.5	Whereas many unicellular organisms and a few multicellular organisms can produce genetically identical clones of themselves through cell division, many single-celled organisms and most multicellular organisms reproduce regularly using another method.
7.11.6	Sexual reproduction is the production by parents of two haploid cells and the fusion of two haploid cells to form a single, unique diploid cell.
7.11.7	In most plants and animals, through tens of rounds of mitotic cell division, this diploid cell will develop into an adult organism.
7.11.8	Haploid cells that are part of the sexual reproductive cycle are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis.
7.11.9	Sexual reproduction, specifically meiosis and fertilization, introduces variation into offspring that may account for the evolutionary success of sexual reproduction.
7.11.10	The vast majority of eukaryotic organisms, both multicellular and unicellular, can or must employ some form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce.
7.11.11	Sexual reproduction requires fertilization, the union of two cells from two individual organisms.
7.11.12	If those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes, then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes.
7.11.13	Haploid cells contain one set of chromosomes.
7.11.14	Cells containing two sets of chromosomes are called diploid.
7.11.15	The number of sets of chromosomes in a cell is called its ploidy level.
7.11.16	If the reproductive cycle is to continue, then the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets before fertilization can occur again, or there will be a continual doubling in the number of chromosome sets in every generation.
7.11.17	So, in addition to fertilization, sexual reproduction includes a nuclear division that reduces the number of chromosome sets.
7.11.18	Most animals and plants are diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes.
7.11.19	In each somatic cell of the organism (all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells), the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome, called homologous chromosomes.
7.11.20	Somatic cells are sometimes referred to
7.11.21	as “body” cells.
7.11.22	Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing the same genes in identical locations along their length.
7.11.23	Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from each parent; all together, they are considered a full set of chromosomes.
7.11.24	Haploid cells, containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome, are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores.
7.11.25	Spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell.
7.11.26	All animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm, or gametes.
7.11.27	Some plants and all fungi produce spores.
7.11.28	The nuclear division that forms haploid cells, which is called meiosis, is related to mitosis.
7.11.29	As you have learned, mitosis is the part of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also genetically identical to the original parent nucleus.
7.11.30	In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei are at the same ploidy level—diploid for most plants and animals.
7.11.31	Meiosis employs many of the same mechanisms as mitosis.
7.11.32	However, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the nuclei that result at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid.
7.11.33	To achieve this reduction in chromosome number, meiosis consists of one round of chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division.
7.11.34	Because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned.
7.11.35	However, because there are two rounds of division, the major process and the stages are designated with a “
7.11.36	I” or a “II.
7.11.37	”
7.11.38	Thus, meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on.
7.11.39	Meiosis II, in which the second round of meiotic division takes place, includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.
7.11.40	Meiosis I
7.11.41	Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the G1, S, and G2 phases, which are nearly identical to the phases preceding mitosis.
7.11.42	The G1 phase, which is also called the first gap phase, is the first phase of the interphase and is focused on cell growth.
7.11.43	The S phase is the second phase of interphase, during which the DNA of the chromosomes is replicated.
7.11.44	Finally, the G2 phase, also called the second gap phase, is the third and final phase of interphase; in this phase, the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis.
7.11.45	During DNA duplication in the S phase, each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies, called sister chromatids, that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins.
7.11.46	Cohesin holds the chromatids together until anaphase II.
7.11.47	The centrosomes, which are the structures that organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle, also replicate.
7.11.48	This prepares the cell to enter prophase I, the first meiotic phase.
7.11.49	Prophase I
7.11.50	Early in prophase I, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly microscopically, the homologous chromosomes are attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins.
7.11.51	As the nuclear envelope begins to break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair close to each other.
7.11.52	Recall that, in mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair together.
7.11.53	In mitosis, homologous chromosomes line up end-to-end so that when they divide, each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair.
7.11.54	The synaptonemal complex, a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes.
7.11.55	The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis.
7.11.56	In synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other.
7.11.57	The synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non-sister homologous chromatids, a process called crossing over.
7.11.58	Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata (singular = chiasma)
7.11.59	(Figure 11.2).
7.11.60	In species such as humans, even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not homologous (most of their genes differ), they have a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I.
7.11.61	A partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology.
7.11.62	Early in prophase I, homologous chromosomes come together to form a synapse.
7.11.63	The chromosomes are bound tightly together and in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesin proteins at the centromere.
7.11.64	Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules.
7.11.65	These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover—or genetic recombination—between the non-sister chromatids.
7.11.66	Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid, the double-stranded DNA is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the non-sister chromatids.
7.11.67	As prophase I progresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense.
7.11.68	When the synaptonemal complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata.
7.11.69	The chiasmata remain until anaphase I.
7.11.70	The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome.
7.11.71	There must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, but there may be as many as 25.
7.11.72	Following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed.
7.11.73	At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata (Figure 11.3) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible.
7.11.74	The crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis.
7.11.75	A single crossover event between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome.
7.11.76	Now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some DNA from one parent of the individual and some DNA from the other parent.
7.11.77	The sister recombinant chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover.
7.11.78	Multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect, exchanging segments of DNA to create recombinant chromosomes.
7.11.79	Crossover occurs between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes.
7.11.80	The result is an exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes.
7.11.81	Prometaphase I
7.11.82	The key event in prometaphase
7.11.83	I is the attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at the centromeres.
7.11.84	Kinetochore proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a chromosome to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle.
7.11.85	Microtubules grow from centrosomes placed at opposite poles of the cell.
7.11.86	The microtubules move toward the middle of the cell and attach to one of the two fused homologous chromosomes.
7.11.87	The microtubules attach at each chromosomes' kinetochores.
7.11.88	With each member of the homologous pair attached to opposite poles of the cell, in the next phase, the microtubules can pull the homologous pair apart.
7.11.89	A spindle fiber that has attached to a kinetochore is called a kinetochore microtubule.
7.11.90	At the end of prometaphase I, each tetrad is attached to microtubules from both poles, with one homologous chromosome facing each pole.
7.11.91	The homologous chromosomes are still held together at chiasmata.
7.11.92	In addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely.
7.11.93	Metaphase I
7.11.94	During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the center of the cell with the kinetochores facing opposite poles.
7.11.95	The homologous pairs orient themselves randomly at the equator.
7.11.96	For example, if the two homologous members of chromosome 1 are labeled a and b, then the chromosomes could line up a-b, or b-a.
7.11.97	This is important in determining the genes carried by a gamete, as each will only receive one of the two homologous chromosomes.
7.11.98	Recall that homologous chromosomes are not identical.
7.11.99	They contain slight differences in their genetic information, causing each gamete to have a unique genetic makeup.
7.11.100	This randomness is the physical basis for the creation of the second form of genetic variation in offspring.
7.11.101	Consider that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one from each parent.
7.11.102	Using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother.
7.11.103	The father provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg.
7.11.104	Every cell of the multicellular offspring has copies of the original two sets of homologous chromosomes.
7.11.105	In prophase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes form the tetrads.
7.11.106	In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell to form the metaphase plate.
7.11.107	Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random.
7.11.108	Any maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole.
7.11.109	Any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole.
7.11.110	The orientation of each tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads.
7.11.111	This event—the random (or independent) assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate—is the second mechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores.
7.11.112	In each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the tetrads is different.
7.11.113	The number of variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set.
7.11.114	There are two possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the possible number of alignments therefore equals 2n, where n is the number of chromosomes per set.
7.11.115	Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (223) possible genetically-distinct gametes.
7.11.116	This number does not include the variability that was previously created in the sister chromatids by crossover.
7.11.117	Given these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic composition (Figure 11.4).
7.11.118	To summarize the genetic consequences of meiosis I, the maternal and paternal genes are recombined by crossover events that occur between each homologous pair during prophase I.
7.11.119	In addition, the random assortment of tetrads on the metaphase plate produces a unique combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes.
7.11.120	Random, independent assortment during metaphase I can be demonstrated by considering a cell with a set of two chromosomes (n = 2).
7.11.121	In this case, there are two possible arrangements at the equatorial plane in metaphase
7.11.122	I.
7.11.123	The total possible number of different gametes is 2n, where n equals the number of chromosomes in a set.
7.11.124	In this example, there are four possible genetic combinations for the gametes.
7.11.125	With n = 23 in human cells, there are over 8 million possible combinations of paternal and maternal chromosomes.
7.11.126	Anaphase I
7.11.127	In anaphase I, the microtubules pull the linked chromosomes apart.
7.11.128	The sister chromatids remain tightly bound together at the centromere.
7.11.129	The chiasmata are broken in anaphase I as the microtubules attached to the fused kinetochores pull the homologous chromosomes apart (Figure 11.5).
7.11.130	Telophase I and Cytokinesis
7.11.131	In telophase, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles.
7.11.132	The remainder of the typical telophase events may or may not occur, depending on the species.
7.11.133	In some organisms, the chromosomes decondense and nuclear envelopes form around the chromatids in telophase I.
7.11.134	In other organisms, cytokinesis—the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells—occurs without reformation of the nuclei.
7.11.135	In nearly all species of animals and some fungi, cytokinesis separates the cell contents via a cleavage furrow (constriction of the actin ring that leads to cytoplasmic division).
7.11.136	In plants, a cell plate is formed during cell cytokinesis by Golgi vesicles fusing at the metaphase plate.
7.11.137	This cell plate will ultimately lead to the formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells.
7.11.138	Two haploid cells are the end result of the first meiotic division.
7.11.139	The cells are haploid because at each pole, there is just one of each pair of the homologous chromosomes.
7.11.140	Therefore, only one full set of the chromosomes is present.
7.11.141	This is why the cells are considered haploid—
7.11.142	there is only one chromosome set, even though each homolog still consists of two sister chromatids.
7.11.143	Recall that sister chromatids are merely duplicates of one of the two homologous chromosomes (except for changes that occurred during crossing over).
7.11.144	In meiosis II, these two sister chromatids will separate, creating four haploid daughter cells.
7.11.145	Meiosis II
7.11.146	In some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or interkinesis, before entering meiosis II.
7.11.147	Interkinesis lacks an S phase, so chromosomes are not duplicated.
7.11.148	The two cells produced in meiosis I go through the events of meiosis II in synchrony.
7.11.149	During meiosis II, the sister chromatids within the two daughter cells separate, forming four new haploid gametes.
7.11.150	The mechanics of meiosis II is similar to mitosis, except that each dividing cell has only one set of homologous chromosomes.
7.11.151	Therefore, each cell has half the number of sister chromatids to separate out as a diploid cell undergoing mitosis.
7.11.152	Prophase II
7.11.153	If the chromosomes decondensed in telophase I, they condense again.
7.11.154	If nuclear envelopes were formed, they fragment into vesicles.
7.11.155	The centrosomes that were duplicated during interkinesis move away from each other toward opposite poles, and new spindles are formed.
7.11.156	Prometaphase II
7.11.157	The nuclear envelopes are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully formed.
7.11.158	Each sister chromatid forms an individual kinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles.
7.11.159	Metaphase II
7.11.160	The sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the equator of the cell.
7.11.161	Anaphase II
7.11.162	The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the kinetochore microtubules and move toward opposite poles.
7.11.163	Non-kinetochore microtubules elongate the cell.
7.11.164	The process of chromosome alignment differs between meiosis I and meiosis II.
7.11.165	In prometaphase I, microtubules attach to the fused kinetochores of homologous chromosomes, and the homologous chromosomes are arranged at the midpoint of the cell in metaphase I.
7.11.166	In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are separated.
7.11.167	In prometaphase II, microtubules attach to the kinetochores of sister chromatids, and the sister chromatids are arranged at the midpoint of the cells in metaphase II.
7.11.168	In anaphase II, the sister chromatids are separated.
7.11.169	Telophase II and Cytokinesis
7.11.170	The chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense.
7.11.171	Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes.
7.11.172	Cytokinesis separates the two cells into four unique haploid cells.
7.11.173	At this point, the newly formed nuclei are both haploid.
7.11.174	The cells produced are genetically unique because of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and because of the recombining of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomes (with their sets of genes) that occurs during crossover.
7.11.175	The entire process of meiosis is outlined in Figure 11.6.
7.11.176	An animal cell with a diploid number of four (2n = 4) proceeds through the stages of meiosis to form four haploid daughter cells.
7.11.177	Comparing Meiosis and Mitosis Mitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells.
7.11.178	They share some similarities, but also exhibit distinct differences that lead to very different outcomes (Figure 11.7).
7.11.179	Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells.
7.11.180	The nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the original nucleus.
7.11.181	They have the same number of sets of chromosomes, one set in the case of haploid cells and two sets in the case of diploid cells.
7.11.182	In most plants and all animal species, it is typically diploid cells that undergo mitosis to form new diploid cells.
7.11.183	In contrast, meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are usually partitioned into four new cells.
7.11.184	The nuclei resulting from meiosis are not genetically identical and they contain one chromosome set only.
7.11.185	This is half the number of chromosome sets in the original cell, which is diploid.
7.11.186	The main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis I, which is a very different nuclear division than mitosis.
7.11.187	In meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs become associated with each other, are bound together with the synaptonemal complex, develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between sister chromatids, and line up along the metaphase plate in tetrads with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog in a tetrad.
7.11.188	All of these events occur only in meiosis I. When the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another, the ploidy level—
7.11.189	the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus—has been reduced from two to one.
7.11.190	For this reason, meiosis I is referred to as a reduction division.
7.11.191	There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis.
7.11.192	Meiosis II is much more analogous to a mitotic division.
7.11.193	In this case, the duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line up on the metaphase plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite poles.
7.11.194	During anaphase II, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatid—now referred to as a chromosome—is pulled to one pole while the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole.
7.11.195	If it were not for the fact that there had been crossover, the two products of each individual meiosis II division would be identical (like in mitosis).
7.11.196	Instead, they are different because there has always been at least one crossover per chromosome.
7.11.197	Meiosis II is not a reduction division because although there are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis I. Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one round of DNA replication; however, meiosis includes two nuclear divisions.
7.11.198	The four daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and genetically distinct.
7.11.199	The daughter cells resulting from mitosis are diploid and identical to the parent cell.
7.11.200	Sexual reproduction was an early evolutionary innovation after the appearance of eukaryotic cells.
7.11.201	It appears to have been very successful because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually, and in many animals, it is the only mode of reproduction.
7.11.202	And yet, scientists recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction.
7.11.203	On the surface, creating offspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a better system.
7.11.204	If the parent organism is successfully occupying a habitat, offspring with the same traits would be similarly successful.
7.11.205	There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that can produce offspring whenever circumstances are favorable by asexual budding, fragmentation, or asexual eggs.
7.11.206	These methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex.
7.11.207	Indeed, some organisms that lead a solitary lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually.
7.11.208	In addition, in asexual populations, every individual is capable of reproduction.
7.11.209	In sexual populations, the males are not producing the offspring themselves, so in theory an asexual population could grow twice as fast.
7.11.210	However, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare.
7.11.211	Why is sexuality (and meiosis) so common?
7.11.212	This is one of the important unanswered questions in biology and has been the focus of much research beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century.
7.11.213	There are several possible explanations, one of which is that the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and reproduction of the population.
7.11.214	Thus, on average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an otherwise similar asexually reproducing population.
7.11.215	The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation.
7.11.216	This is the ultimate source of variation in sexual organisms, but in addition, those different mutations are continually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are mixed into different combinations by crossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I. Life Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles.
7.11.217	What happens between these two events depends on the organism.
7.11.218	The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half.
7.11.219	Fertilization, the joining of two haploid gametes, restores the diploid condition.
7.11.220	There are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms: diploid-dominant, in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with most animals including humans; haploid- dominant, in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with all fungi and some algae; and alternation of generations, in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group, as with plants and some algae.
7.11.221	Diploid-Dominant Life
7.11.222	Cycle
7.11.223	Nearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes.
7.11.224	Early in the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, called germ cells, are produced within the gonads, such as the testes and ovaries.
7.11.225	Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes.
7.11.226	Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again.
7.11.227	There is no multicellular haploid life stage.
7.11.228	Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the diploid state (Figure 11.8).
7.11.229	In animals, sexually reproducing adults form haploid gametes from diploid germ cells.
7.11.230	Fusion of the gametes gives rise to a fertilized egg cell, or zygote.
7.11.231	The zygote will undergo multiple rounds of mitosis to produce a multicellular offspring.
7.11.232	The germ cells are generated early in the development of the zygote.
7.11.233	Haploid-Dominant Life Cycle Most fungi and algae employ a life-cycle type in which the “body” of the organism—the ecologically important part of the life cycle—is haploid.
7.11.234	The haploid cells that make up the tissues of the dominant multicellular stage are formed by mitosis.
7.11.235	During sexual reproduction, specialized haploid cells from two individuals, designated the (+)
7.11.236	and (−) mating types, join to form a diploid zygote.
7.11.237	The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid cells called spores.
7.11.238	Although haploid like the “parents,” these spores contain a new genetic combination from two parents.
7.11.239	The spores can remain dormant for various time periods.
7.11.240	Eventually, when conditions are conducive, the spores form multicellular haploid structures by many rounds of mitosis (Figure 11.9).
7.11.241	Alternation of Generations
7.11.242	The third life-cycle type, employed by some algae and all plants, is a blend of the haploid-dominant and diploid-dominant extremes.
7.11.243	Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle.
7.11.244	The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes, because they produce gametes from specialized cells.
7.11.245	Meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case, because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid.
7.11.246	Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote.
7.11.247	The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte.
7.11.248	Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores.
7.11.249	The spores will subsequently develop into the gametophytes (Figure 11.10).
7.11.250	Plants have a life cycle that alternates between a multicellular haploid organism and a multicellular diploid organism.
7.11.251	In some plants, such as ferns, both the haploid and diploid plant stages are free-living.
7.11.252	The diploid plant is called a sporophyte because it produces haploid spores by meiosis.
7.11.253	The spores develop into multicellular, haploid plants called gametophytes because they produce gametes.
7.11.254	The gametes of two individuals will fuse to form a diploid zygote that becomes the sporophyte.
7.11.255	Although all plants utilize some version of the alternation of generations, the relative size of the sporophyte and the gametophyte and the relationship between them vary greatly.
7.11.256	In plants such as moss, the gametophyte organism is the free-living plant, and the sporophyte is physically dependent on the gametophyte.
7.11.257	In other plants, such as ferns, both the gametophyte and sporophyte plants are free-living; however, the sporophyte is much larger.
7.11.258	In seed plants, such as magnolia trees and daisies, the gametophyte is composed of only a few cells and, in the case of the female gametophyte, is completely retained within the sporophyte.
7.11.259	Sexual reproduction takes many forms in multicellular organisms.
7.11.260	However, at some point in each type of life cycle, meiosis produces haploid cells that will fuse with the haploid cell of another organism.
7.11.261	The mechanisms of variation—crossover, random assortment of homologous chromosomes, and random fertilization—are present in all versions of sexual reproduction.
7.11.262	The fact that nearly every multicellular organism on Earth employs sexual reproduction is strong evidence for the benefits of producing offspring with unique gene combinations, though there are other possible benefits as well.
7.12.0	Experimenting with thousands of garden peas, Mendel uncovered the fundamentals of genetics.
7.12.1	Introduction Genetics is the study of heredity.
7.12.2	Johann Gregor Mendel set the framework for genetics long before chromosomes or genes had been identified, at a time when meiosis was not well understood.
7.12.3	Mendel selected a simple biological system and conducted methodical, quantitative analyses using large sample sizes.
7.12.4	Because of Mendel’s work, the fundamental principles of heredity were revealed.
7.12.5	We now know that genes, carried on chromosomes, are the basic functional units of heredity with the capability to be replicated, expressed, or mutated.
7.12.6	Today, the postulates put forth by Mendel
7.12.7	form the basis of classical, or Mendelian, genetics.
7.12.8	Not all genes are transmitted from parents to offspring according to Mendelian genetics, but Mendel’s experiments serve as an excellent starting point for thinking about inheritance.
7.12.9	Johann Gregor Mendel is considered the father of genetics.
7.12.10	Johann Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) (Figure 12.2) was a lifelong learner, teacher, scientist, and man of faith.
7.12.11	As a young adult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic.
7.12.12	Supported by the monastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels.
7.12.13	In 1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system (a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems).
7.12.14	In 1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural History Society.
7.12.15	He demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to offspring independently of other traits and in dominant and recessive patterns.
7.12.16	In 1866, he published his work, Experiments in Plant Hybridization, in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn.
7.12.17	Mendel’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed, incorrectly, that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring; this hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation.
7.12.18	Continuous variation results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height.
7.12.19	Offspring appear to be a “blend” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation.
7.12.20	The blending theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is not the case.
7.12.21	Mendel was the first researcher to see it.
7.12.22	Instead of continuous characteristics, Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes (specifically, violet versus white flowers); this is referred to as discontinuous variation.
7.12.23	Mendel’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring, nor were they absorbed, but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on.
7.12.24	In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties.
7.12.25	He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific contributions during his lifetime.
7.12.26	In fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.
7.12.27	Mendel’s Model System
7.12.28	Mendel’s seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea, Pisum sativum, to study inheritance.
7.12.29	This species naturally self-fertilizes, such that pollen encounters ova within individual flowers.
7.12.30	The flower petals remain sealed tightly until after pollination, preventing pollination from other plants.
7.12.31	The result is highly inbred, or “true-breeding,” pea plants.
7.12.32	These are plants that always produce offspring that look like the parent.
7.12.33	By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding.
7.12.34	The garden pea also grows to maturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time.
7.12.35	Finally, large quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his results did not come about simply by chance.
7.12.36	Mendelian Crosses Mendel performed hybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits.
7.12.37	In the pea, which is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety.
7.12.38	In plants, pollen carries the male gametes (sperm) to the stigma, a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the sperm to move down the pistil to the female gametes (ova) below.
7.12.39	To prevent the pea plant that was receiving pollen from self-fertilizing and confounding his results, Mendel painstakingly removed all of the anthers from the plant’s flowers before they had a chance to mature.
7.12.40	Plants used in first-generation crosses were called P0, or parental generation one, plants (Figure 12.3).
7.12.41	Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season.
7.12.42	These offspring were called the F1, or the first filial (filial = offspring, daughter or son), generation.
7.12.43	Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants, he allowed them to self-fertilize naturally.
7.12.44	He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1 plants to produce the F2, or second filial, generation.
7.12.45	Mendel’s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 and F4 generations, and so on, but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P0−F1−F2 generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendel’s postulates.
7.12.46	In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns, Mendel crossed plants that were true-breeding for violet flower color with plants true-breeding for white flower color (the P generation).
7.12.47	The resulting hybrids in the F1 generation all had violet flowers.
7.12.48	In the F2 generation, approximately three quarters of the plants had violet flowers, and one quarter had white flowers.
7.12.49	Garden Pea Characteristics Revealed the Basics of Heredity
7.12.50	In his 1865 publication, Mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics, each with two contrasting traits.
7.12.51	A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic.
7.12.52	The characteristics included plant height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, pea pod size, pea pod color, and flower position.
7.12.53	For the characteristic of flower color, for example, the two contrasting traits were white versus violet.
7.12.54	To fully examine each characteristic, Mendel generated large numbers of F1 and F2 plants, reporting results from 19,959 F2 plants alone.
7.12.55	His findings were consistent.
7.12.56	What results did Mendel find in his crosses for flower color?
7.12.57	First, Mendel confirmed that he had plants that bred true for white or violet flower color.
7.12.58	Regardless of how many generations Mendel examined, all self-crossed offspring of parents with white flowers had white flowers, and all self-crossed offspring of parents with violet flowers had violet flowers.
7.12.59	In addition, Mendel confirmed that, other than flower color, the pea plants were physically identical.
7.12.60	Once these validations were complete, Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers.
7.12.61	After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross, Mendel found that 100 percent of the F1 hybrid generation had violet flowers.
7.12.62	Conventional wisdom at that time would have predicted the hybrid flowers to be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers.
7.12.63	In other words, the contrasting parental traits were expected to blend in the offspring.
7.12.64	Instead, Mendel’s results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the F1 generation had completely disappeared.
7.12.65	Importantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there.
7.12.66	He allowed the F1 plants to self-fertilize and found that, of F2- generation plants, 705 had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers.
7.12.67	This was a ratio of 3.15 violet flowers per one white flower, or approximately 3:1.
7.12.68	When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa, he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent, male or female, contributed which trait.
7.12.69	This is called a reciprocal cross—a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross.
7.12.70	For the other six characteristics Mendel examined, the F1 and F2 generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color.
7.12.71	One of the two traits would disappear completely from the F1 generation only to reappear in the F2 generation at a ratio of approximately 3:1 Upon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, Mendel concluded that the characteristics could be divided into expressed and latent traits.
7.12.72	He called these, respectively, dominant and recessive traits.
7.12.73	Dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization.
7.12.74	Recessive traits become latent, or disappear, in the offspring of a hybridization.
7.12.75	The recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring.
7.12.76	An example of a dominant trait is the violet-flower trait.
7.12.77	For this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait.
7.12.78	The fact that the recessive trait reappeared in the F2 generation meant that the traits remained separate (not blended) in the plants of the F1 generation.
7.12.79	Mendel also proposed that plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower-color characteristic, and that each parent transmitted one of its two copies to its offspring, where they came together.
7.12.80	Moreover, the physical observation of a dominant trait could mean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of the characteristic or that it included one dominant and one recessive version.
7.12.81	Conversely, the observation of a recessive trait meant that the organism lacked any dominant versions of this characteristic.
7.12.82	So why did Mendel repeatedly obtain 3:1 ratios in his crosses?
7.12.83	To understand how Mendel deduced the basic mechanisms of inheritance that lead to such ratios, we must first review the laws of probability.
7.12.84	Probability Basics Probabilities are mathematical measures of likelihood.
7.12.85	The empirical probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of times the event occurs by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur.
7.12.86	It is also possible to calculate theoretical probabilities by dividing the number of times that an event is expected to occur by the number of times that it could occur.
7.12.87	Empirical probabilities come from observations, like those of Mendel.
7.12.88	Theoretical probabilities come from knowing how the events are produced and assuming that the probabilities of individual outcomes are equal.
7.12.89	A probability of one for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero indicates that it is guaranteed not to occur.
7.12.90	An example of a genetic event is a round seed produced by a pea plant.
7.12.91	In his experiment, Mendel demonstrated that the probability of the event “round seed
7.12.92	” occurring was one in the F1 offspring of true-breeding parents, one of which has round seeds and one of which has wrinkled seeds.
7.12.93	When the F1 plants were subsequently self-crossed, the probability of any given F2 offspring having round seeds was now three out of four.
7.12.94	In other words, in a large population of F2 offspring chosen at random, 75 percent were expected to have round seeds, whereas 25 percent were expected to have wrinkled seeds.
7.12.95	Using large numbers of crosses, Mendel was able to calculate probabilities and use these to predict the outcomes of other crosses.
7.12.96	The Product Rule and Sum Rule Mendel demonstrated that the pea-plant characteristics he studied were transmitted as discrete units from parent to offspring.
7.12.97	As will be discussed, Mendel also determined that different characteristics, like seed color and seed texture, were transmitted independently of one another and could be considered in separate probability analyses.
7.12.98	For instance, performing a cross between a plant with green, wrinkled seeds and a plant with yellow, round seeds still produced offspring that had a 3:1 ratio of green:yellow seeds (ignoring seed texture) and a 3:1 ratio of round:wrinkled seeds (ignoring seed color).
7.12.99	The characteristics of color and texture did not influence each other.
7.12.100	The product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics.
7.12.101	The product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone.
7.12.102	To demonstrate the product rule, imagine that you are rolling a sixsided die (D) and flipping a penny (P) at the same time.
7.12.103	The die may roll any number from 1–6 (D#), whereas the penny may turn up heads (PH) or tails (PT).
7.12.104	The outcome of rolling the die has no effect on the outcome of flipping the penny and vice versa.
7.12.105	There are 12 possible outcomes of this action (Table 12.2), and each event is expected to occur with equal probability.
7.12.106	Of the 12 possible outcomes, the die has a 2/12 (or 1/6) probability of rolling a two, and the penny has a 6/12 (or 1/2) probability of coming up heads.
7.12.107	By the product rule, the probability that you will obtain the combined outcome 2 and heads is: (D2) x (PH)
7.12.108	= (1/6) x (1/2) or 1/12 (Table 12.3).
7.12.109	Notice the word “and” in the description of the probability.
7.12.110	The “and” is a signal to apply the product rule.
7.12.111	For example, consider how the product rule is applied to the dihybrid cross: the probability of having both dominant traits in the F2 progeny is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant trait for each characteristic, as shown here: On the other hand, the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway.
7.12.112	The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event, of two mutually exclusive events, is the sum of their individual probabilities.
7.12.113	Notice the word “or” in the description of the probability.
7.12.114	The “or” indicates that you should apply the sum rule.
7.12.115	In this case, let’s imagine you are flipping a penny (P) and a quarter (Q).
7.12.116	What is the probability of one coin coming up heads and one coin coming up tails?
7.12.117	This outcome can be achieved by two cases: the penny may be heads (PH) and the quarter may be tails (QT), or the quarter may be heads (QH) and the penny may be tails (PT).
7.12.118	Either case fulfills the outcome.
7.12.119	By the sum rule, we calculate the probability of obtaining one head and one tail as [(PH) × (QT)]
7.12.120	+
7.12.121	[(QH) × (PT)]
7.12.122	=
7.12.123	[(1/2) × (1/2)]
7.12.124	+
7.12.125	[(1/2) × (1/2)]
7.12.126	= 1/2 (Table 12.3).
7.12.127	You should also notice that we used the product rule to calculate the probability of PH and QT, and also the probability of PT and QH, before we summed them.
7.12.128	Again, the sum rule can be applied to show the probability of having just one dominant trait in the F2 generation of a dihybrid cross: To use probability laws in practice, it is necessary to work with large sample sizes because small sample sizes are prone to deviations caused by chance.
7.12.129	The large quantities of pea plants that Mendel examined allowed him calculate the probabilities of the traits appearing in his F2 generation.
7.12.130	As you will learn, this discovery meant that when parental traits were known, the offspring’s traits could be predicted accurately even before fertilization.
7.12.131	The seven characteristics that Mendel evaluated in his pea plants were each expressed as one of two versions, or traits.
7.12.132	The physical expression of characteristics is accomplished through the expression of genes carried on chromosomes.
7.12.133	The genetic makeup of peas consists of two similar or homologous copies of each chromosome, one from each parent.
7.12.134	Each pair of homologous chromosomes has the same linear order of genes.
7.12.135	In other words, peas are diploid organisms in that they have two copies of each chromosome.
7.12.136	The same is true for many other plants and for virtually all animals.
7.12.137	Diploid organisms utilize meiosis to produce haploid gametes, which contain one copy of each homologous chromosome that unite at fertilization to create a diploid zygote.
7.12.138	For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic.
7.12.139	Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles.
7.12.140	Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.
7.12.141	Phenotypes and Genotypes Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics.
7.12.142	The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype.
7.12.143	An organism’s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both physically visible and non-expressed alleles, is called its genotype.
7.12.144	Mendel’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype.
7.12.145	When true-breeding plants in which one parent had yellow pods and one had green pods were cross-fertilized, all of the F1 hybrid offspring had yellow pods.
7.12.146	That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow pods.
7.12.147	However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green pods was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F2 offspring.
7.12.148	Therefore, the F1 plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow pods.
7.12.149	The P1 plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying.
7.12.150	Diploid organisms that are homozygous at a given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes.
7.12.151	Mendel’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait.
7.12.152	When P1 plants with contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait, meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined.
7.12.153	Dominant and Recessive Alleles
7.12.154	Our discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F1 heterozygous offspring were identical to one of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles.
7.12.155	In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting alleles was dominant, and the other was recessive.
7.12.156	Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was referred to as the latent unit factor.
7.12.157	We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous chromosome pairs.
7.12.158	For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype).
7.12.159	The recessive allele will only be observed in homozygous recessive individuals.
7.12.160	Several conventions exist for referring to genes and alleles.
7.12.161	For the purposes of this chapter, we will abbreviate genes using the first letter of the gene’s corresponding dominant trait.
7.12.162	For example, violet is the dominant trait for a pea plant’s flower color, so the flower-color gene would be abbreviated as V (note that it is customary to italicize gene designations).
7.12.163	Furthermore, we will use uppercase and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles, respectively.
7.12.164	Therefore, we would refer to the genotype of a homozygous dominant pea plant with violet flowers as VV, a homozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers as vv, and a heterozygous pea plant with violet flowers as Vv.
7.12.165	The Punnett Square Approach for a Monohybrid Cross
7.12.166	When fertilization occurs between two true-breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic, the process is called a monohybrid cross, and the resulting offspring are monohybrids.
7.12.167	Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic.
7.12.168	On the basis of his results in F1 and F2 generations, Mendel postulated that each parent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination of unit factors was equally likely.
7.12.169	To demonstrate a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green pea seeds.
7.12.170	The dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were YY for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for the plants with green seeds, respectively.
7.12.171	A Punnett square, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies.
7.12.172	To prepare a Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top (for one parent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid, representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes.
7.12.173	Then the combinations of egg and sperm are made in the boxes in the table to show which alleles are combining.
7.12.174	Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or fertilized egg, that could result from this mating.
7.12.175	Because each possibility is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a Punnett square.
7.12.176	If the pattern of inheritance (dominant or recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be inferred as well.
7.12.177	For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents, each parent contributes one type of allele.
7.12.178	In this case, only one genotype is possible.
7.12.179	All offspring are Yy and have yellow seeds.
7.12.180	In the P generation, pea plants that are true-breeding for the dominant yellow phenotype are crossed with plants with the recessive green phenotype.
7.12.181	This cross produces F1 heterozygotes with a yellow phenotype.
7.12.182	Punnett square analysis can be used to predict the genotypes of the F2 generation.
7.12.183	A self-cross of one of the Yy heterozygous offspring can be represented in a 2 × 2 Punnett square because each parent can donate one of two different alleles.
7.12.184	Therefore, the offspring can potentially have one of four allele combinations: YY, Yy, yY, or yy (Figure 12.4).
7.12.185	Notice that there are two ways to obtain the Yy genotype: a Y from the egg and a y from the sperm, or a y from the egg and a Y from the sperm.
7.12.186	Both of these possibilities must be counted.
7.12.187	Recall that Mendel’s peaplant characteristics behaved in the same way in reciprocal crosses.
7.12.188	Therefore, the two possible heterozygous combinations produce offspring that are genotypically and phenotypically identical despite their dominant and recessive alleles deriving from different parents.
7.12.189	They are grouped together.
7.12.190	Because fertilization is a random event, we expect each combination to be equally likely and for the offspring to exhibit a ratio of YY:
7.12.191	Yy:yy genotypes of 1:2:1 (Figure 12.4).
7.12.192	Furthermore, because the YY and Yy offspring have yellow seeds and are phenotypically identical, applying the sum rule of probability, we expect the offspring to exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow:1 green.
7.12.193	Indeed, working with large sample sizes, Mendel observed approximately this ratio in every F2 generation resulting from crosses for individual traits.
7.12.194	Mendel validated these results by performing an F3 cross in which he self-crossed the dominant- and recessive-expressing F2 plants.
7.12.195	When he self-crossed the plants expressing green seeds, all of the offspring had green seeds, confirming that all green seeds had homozygous genotypes of yy.
7.12.196	When he self-crossed the F2 plants expressing yellow seeds, he found that one-third of the plants bred true, and two-thirds of the plants segregated at a 3:1 ratio of yellow:green seeds.
7.12.197	In this case, the true-breeding plants had homozygous (YY) genotypes, whereas the segregating plants corresponded to the heterozygous (Yy) genotype.
7.12.198	When these plants self-fertilized, the outcome was just like the F1 self-fertilizing cross.
7.12.199	The Test Cross Distinguishes the Dominant Phenotype Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents, Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote.
7.12.200	Called the test cross, this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders.
7.12.201	In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic.
7.12.202	If the dominant-expressing organism is a homozygote, then all F1 offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait (Figure 12.5).
7.12.203	Alternatively, if the dominant expressing organism is a heterozygote, the F1 offspring will exhibit a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive homozygotes (Figure 12.5).
7.12.204	The test cross further validates Mendel’s postulate that pairs of unit factors segregate equally.
7.12.205	A test cross can be performed to determine whether an organism expressing a dominant trait is a homozygote or a heterozygote.
7.12.206	In pea plants, round peas (R) are dominant to wrinkled peas (r).
7.12.207	You do a test cross between a pea plant with wrinkled peas (genotype rr) and a plant of unknown genotype that has round peas.
7.12.208	You end up with three plants, all which have round peas.
7.12.209	From this data, can you tell if the round pea parent plant is homozygous dominant or heterozygous?
7.12.210	If the round pea parent plant is heterozygous, what is the probability that a random sample of 3 progeny peas will all be round?
7.12.211	Many human diseases are genetically inherited.
7.12.212	A healthy person in a family in which some members suffer from a recessive genetic disorder may want to know if he or she has the disease-causing gene and what risk exists of passing the disorder on to his or her offspring.
7.12.213	Of course, doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical.
7.12.214	Instead, geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases.
7.12.215	Alkaptonuria is a recessive genetic disorder in which two amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine, are not properly metabolized.
7.12.216	Affected individuals may have darkened skin and brown urine, and may suffer joint damage and other complications.
7.12.217	In this pedigree, individuals with the disorder are indicated in blue and have the genotype aa.
7.12.218	Unaffected individuals are indicated in yellow and have the genotype AA or Aa.
7.12.219	Note that it is often possible to determine a person’s genotype from the genotype of their offspring.
7.12.220	For example, if neither parent has the disorder but their child does, they must be heterozygous.
7.12.221	Two individuals on the pedigree have an unaffected phenotype but unknown genotype.
7.12.222	Because they do not have the disorder, they must have at least one normal allele, so their genotype gets the “A?
7.12.223	” designation.
7.12.224	Alternatives to Dominance and
7.12.225	Recessiveness Mendel’s experiments with pea plants suggested that: (1) two “units” or alleles exist for every gene; (2) alleles maintain their integrity in each generation (no blending); and (3) in the presence of the dominant allele, the recessive allele is hidden and makes no contribution to the phenotype.
7.12.226	Therefore, recessive alleles can be “carried” and not expressed by individuals.
7.12.227	Such heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as “carriers.
7.12.228	”
7.12.229	Further genetic studies in other plants and animals have shown that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics still hold true.
7.12.230	In the sections to follow, we consider some of the extensions of Mendelism.
7.12.231	If Mendel had chosen an experimental system that exhibited these genetic complexities, it’s possible that he would not have understood what his results meant.
7.12.232	Incomplete Dominance Mendel’s results, that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs, contradicted the view at that time that offspring exhibited a blend of their parents’ traits.
7.12.233	However, the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does appear to be intermediate between the two parents.
7.12.234	For example, in the snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus (Figure 12.7), a cross between a homozygous parent with white flowers (CWCW) and a homozygous parent with red flowers (CRCR) will produce offspring with pink flowers (CRCW).
7.12.235	(Note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness.)
7.12.236	This pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance, denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype.
7.12.237	The allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers.
7.12.238	However, the results of a heterozygote self-cross can still be predicted, just as with Mendelian dominant and recessive crosses.
7.12.239	In this case, the genotypic ratio would be 1 CRCR:2 CRCW:1 CWCW, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1 for red:pink:white.
7.12.240	Codominance
7.12.241	A variation on incomplete dominance is codominance, in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote.
7.12.242	An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans.
7.12.243	The M and N alleles are expressed in the form of an M or N antigen present on the surface of red blood cells.
7.12.244	Homozygotes (LMLM and LNLN) express either the M or the N allele, and heterozygotes (LMLN) express both alleles equally.
7.12.245	In a self-cross between heterozygotes expressing a codominant trait, the three possible offspring genotypes are phenotypically distinct.
7.12.246	However, the 1:2:1 genotypic ratio characteristic of a Mendelian monohybrid cross still applies.
7.12.247	Multiple Alleles Mendel implied that only two alleles, one dominant and one recessive, could exist for a given gene.
7.12.248	We now know that this is an oversimplification.
7.12.249	Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) can only have two alleles for a given gene, multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed.
7.12.250	Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene, the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type (often abbreviated “+”); this is considered the standard or norm.
7.12.251	All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard, meaning that they deviate from the wild type.
7.12.252	The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild-type allele.
7.12.253	An example of multiple alleles is coat color in rabbits (Figure 12.8).
7.12.254	Here, four alleles exist for the c gene.
7.12.255	The wild-type version, C+C+, is expressed as brown fur.
7.12.256	The chinchilla phenotype, cchcch, is expressed as black-tipped white fur.
7.12.257	The Himalayan phenotype, chch, has black fur on the extremities and white fur elsewhere.
7.12.258	Finally, the albino, or “colorless” phenotype, cc, is expressed as white fur.
7.12.259	In cases of multiple alleles, dominance hierarchies can exist.
7.12.260	In this case, the wildtype allele is dominant over all the others, chinchilla is incompletely dominant over Himalayan and albino, and Himalayan is dominant over albino.
7.12.261	This hierarchy, or allelic series, was revealed by observing the phenotypes of each possible heterozygote offspring.
7.12.262	The complete dominance of a wild-type phenotype over all other mutants often occurs as an effect of “dosage” of a specific gene product, such that the wild-type allele supplies the correct amount of gene product whereas the mutant alleles cannot.
7.12.263	For the allelic series in rabbits, the wild-type allele may supply a given dosage of fur pigment, whereas the mutants supply a lesser dosage or none at all.
7.12.264	Interestingly, the Himalayan phenotype is the result of an allele that produces a temperaturesensitive gene product that only produces pigment in the cooler extremities of the rabbit’s body.
7.12.265	Alternatively, one mutant allele can be dominant over all other phenotypes, including the wild type.
7.12.266	This may occur when the mutant allele somehow interferes with the genetic message so that even a heterozygote with one wild-type allele copy expresses the mutant phenotype.
7.12.267	One way in which the mutant allele can interfere is by enhancing the function of the wildtype gene product or changing its distribution in the body.
7.12.268	One example of this is the Antennapedia mutation in Drosophila (Figure 12.9).
7.12.269	In this case, the mutant allele expands the distribution of the gene product, and as a result, the Antennapedia heterozygote develops legs on its head where its antennae should be.
7.12.270	As seen in comparing the wild-type Drosophila (left) and the Antennapedia mutant (right), the Antennapedia mutant has legs on its head in place of antennae.
7.12.271	Multiple Alleles Confer Drug Resistance in the Malaria Parasite Malaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, including Anopheles gambiae (Figure 12.10a), and is characterized by cyclic high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms, and severe anemia.
7.12.272	Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are the most common causative agents of malaria, and P. falciparum is the most deadly (Figure 12.10b).
7.12.273	When promptly and correctly treated, P. falciparum malaria has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent.
7.12.274	However, in some parts of the world, the parasite has evolved resistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by geographic region.
7.12.275	The (a) Anopheles gambiae, or African malaria mosquito, acts as a vector in the transmission to humans of the malaria-causing parasite (b) Plasmodium falciparum, here visualized using false-color transmission electron microscopy.
7.12.276	(credit a: James D. Gathany; credit b: Ute Frevert; false color by Margaret Shear; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.12.277	In Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, P. falciparum has developed resistance to the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine, mefloquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
7.12.278	P. falciparum, which is haploid during the life stage in which it is infectious to humans, has evolved multiple drug-resistant mutant alleles of the dhps gene.
7.12.279	Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are associated with each of these alleles.
7.12.280	Being haploid, P. falciparum needs only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.
7.12.281	In Southeast Asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of the dhps gene are localized to different geographic regions.
7.12.282	This is a common evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug-resistant mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other P. falciparum isolates in close proximity.
7.12.283	Sulfadoxineresistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions where this drug is widely used as an over-the-counter malaria remedy.
7.12.284	As is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers within an infection cycle, P. falciparum evolves relatively rapidly (over a decade or so) in response to the selective pressure of commonly used anti-malarial drugs.
7.12.285	For this reason, scientists must constantly work to develop new drugs or drug combinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden.
7.12.286	X-Linked Traits
7.12.287	In humans, as well as in many other animals and some plants, the sex of the individual is determined by sex chromosomes.
7.12.288	The sex chromosomes are one pair of non-homologous chromosomes.
7.12.289	Until now, we have only considered inheritance patterns among non-sex chromosomes, or autosomes.
7.12.290	In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes, whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair.
7.12.291	Although the Y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis, the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes.
7.12.292	When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome, but not on the Y chromosome, it is said to be X-linked.
7.12.293	Eye color in Drosophila was one of the first X-linked traits to be identified.
7.12.294	Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait to the X chromosome in 1910.
7.12.295	Like humans, Drosophila males have an XY chromosome pair, and females are XX.
7.12.296	In flies, the wild-type eye color is red (XW) and it is dominant to white eye color (Xw)
7.12.297	(Figure 12.11).
7.12.298	Because of the location of the eye-color gene, reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios.
7.12.299	Males are said to be hemizygous, because they have only one allele for any X-linked characteristic.
7.12.300	Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males.
7.12.301	Drosophila males lack a second allele copy on the Y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only be XWY or XwY.
7.12.302	In contrast, females have two allele copies of this gene and can be XWXW, XWXw, or XwXw.
7.12.303	In Drosophila, several genes determine eye color.
7.12.304	The genes for white and vermilion eye colors are located on the X chromosome.
7.12.305	Others are located on the autosomes.
7.12.306	Clockwise from top left are brown, cinnabar, sepia, vermilion, white, and red.
7.12.307	Red eye color is wild-type and is dominant to white eye color.
7.12.308	In an X-linked cross, the genotypes of F1 and F2 offspring depend on whether the recessive trait was expressed by the male or the female in the P1 generation.
7.12.309	With regard to Drosophila eye color, when the P1 male expresses the white-eye phenotype and the female is homozygous red-eyed, all members of the F1 generation exhibit red eyes (Figure 12.12).
7.12.310	The F1 females are heterozygous (XWXw), and the males are all XWY, having received their X chromosome from the homozygous dominant P1 female and their Y chromosome from the P1 male.
7.12.311	A subsequent cross between the XWXw female and the XWY male would produce only red-eyed females (with XWXW or XWXw genotypes) and both red- and white-eyed males (with XWY or XwY genotypes).
7.12.312	Now, consider a cross between a homozygous white-eyed female and a male with red eyes.
7.12.313	The F1 generation would exhibit only heterozygous red-eyed females (XWXw) and only white-eyed males (XwY).
7.12.314	Half of the F2 females would be red-eyed (XWXw) and half would be white-eyed (XwXw).
7.12.315	Similarly, half of the F2 males would be red-eyed (XWY) and half would be white-eyed (XwY).
7.12.316	Punnett square analysis is used to determine the ratio of offspring from a cross between a red-eyed male fruit fly and a white-eyed female fruit fly.
7.12.317	Discoveries in fruit fly genetics can be applied to human genetics.
7.12.318	When a female parent is homozygous for a recessive Xlinked trait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her offspring.
7.12.319	Her male offspring are, therefore, destined to express the trait, as they will inherit their father's Y chromosome.
7.12.320	In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some forms of color blindness, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked.
7.12.321	Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and may not exhibit any phenotypic effects.
7.12.322	These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half of their daughters; therefore, recessive X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females.
7.12.323	In some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the gender with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female rather than the male.
7.12.324	This is the case for all birds.
7.12.325	In this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to appear in the female, in which they are hemizygous.
7.12.326	Human Sex-linked Disorders Sex-linkage studies in Morgan’s laboratory provided the fundamentals for understanding X-linked recessive disorders in humans, which include red-green color blindness, and Types A and B hemophilia.
7.12.327	Because human males need to inherit only one recessive mutant X allele to be affected, X-linked disorders are disproportionately observed in males.
7.12.328	Females must inherit recessive X-linked alleles from both of their parents in order to express the trait.
7.12.329	When they inherit one recessive X-linked mutant allele and one dominant X-linked wild-type allele, they are carriers of the trait and are typically unaffected.
7.12.330	Carrier females can manifest mild forms of the trait due to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the X chromosomes.
7.12.331	However, female carriers can contribute the trait to their sons, resulting in the son exhibiting the trait, or they can contribute the recessive allele to their daughters, resulting in the daughters being carriers of the trait (Figure 12.13).
7.12.332	Although some Y-linked recessive disorders exist, typically they are associated with infertility in males and are therefore not transmitted to subsequent generations.
7.12.333	The son of a woman who is a carrier of a recessive X-linked disorder will have a 50 percent chance of being affected.
7.12.334	A daughter will not be affected, but she will have a 50 percent chance of being a carrier like her mother.
7.12.335	Lethality
7.12.336	A large proportion of genes in an individual’s genome are essential for survival.
7.12.337	Occasionally, a nonfunctional allele for an essential gene can arise by mutation and be transmitted in a population as long as individuals with this allele also have a wild-type, functional copy.
7.12.338	The wild-type allele functions at a capacity sufficient to sustain life and is therefore considered to be dominant over the nonfunctional allele.
7.12.339	However, consider two heterozygous parents that have a genotype of wildtype/ nonfunctional mutant for a hypothetical essential gene.
7.12.340	In one quarter of their offspring, we would expect to observe individuals that are homozygous recessive for the nonfunctional allele.
7.12.341	Because the gene is essential, these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization, die in utero, or die later in life, depending on what life stage requires this gene.
7.12.342	An inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non-lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal.
7.12.343	For crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous, only wild-type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed.
7.12.344	The genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1.
7.12.345	In other instances, the recessive lethal allele might also exhibit a dominant (but not lethal) phenotype in the heterozygote.
7.12.346	For instance, the recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote.
7.12.347	A single copy of the wild-type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival.
7.12.348	The dominant lethal inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote; this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age.
7.12.349	Individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form.
7.12.350	Dominant lethal alleles are very rare because, as you might expect, the allele only lasts one generation and is not transmitted.
7.12.351	However, just as the recessive lethal allele might not immediately manifest the phenotype of death, dominant lethal alleles also might not be expressed until adulthood.
7.12.352	Once the individual reaches reproductive age, the allele may be unknowingly passed on, resulting in a delayed death in both generations.
7.12.353	An example of this in humans is Huntington’s disease, in which the nervous system gradually wastes away (Figure 12.14).
7.12.354	People who are heterozygous for the dominant Huntington allele (Hh) will inevitably develop the fatal disease.
7.12.355	However, the onset of Huntington’s disease may not occur until age 40, at which point the afflicted persons may have already passed the allele to 50 percent of their offspring.
7.12.356	The neuron in the center of this micrograph (yellow) has nuclear inclusions characteristic of Huntington’s disease (orange area in the center of the neuron).
7.12.357	Huntington’s disease occurs when an abnormal dominant allele for the Huntington gene is present.

7.12.359	Mendel generalized the results of his pea-plant experiments into four postulates, some of which are sometimes called “laws,” that describe the basis of dominant and recessive inheritance in diploid organisms.
7.12.360	As you have learned, more complex extensions of Mendelism exist that do not exhibit the same F2 phenotypic ratios (3:1).
7.12.361	Nevertheless, these laws summarize the basics of classical genetics.
7.12.362	Pairs of Unit Factors, or Genes Mendel proposed first that paired unit factors of heredity were transmitted faithfully from generation to generation by the dissociation and reassociation of paired factors during gametogenesis and fertilization, respectively.
7.12.363	After he crossed peas with contrasting traits and found that the recessive trait resurfaced in the F2 generation, Mendel deduced that hereditary factors must be inherited as discrete units.
7.12.364	This finding contradicted the belief at that time that parental traits were blended in the offspring.
7.12.365	Alleles Can Be Dominant or Recessive Mendel’s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic.
7.12.366	Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively.
7.12.367	The recessive allele will remain “latent” but will be transmitted to offspring by the same manner in which the dominant allele is transmitted.
7.12.368	The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele (Figure 12.15), and these offspring will breed true when self-crossed.
7.12.369	Since Mendel’s experiments with pea plants, other researchers have found that the law of dominance does not always hold true.
7.12.370	Instead, several different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist.
7.12.371	Equal Segregation of Alleles Observing that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F1 generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, Mendel proposed the law of segregation.
7.12.372	This law states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor.
7.12.373	For the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three possible combinations of genotypes could result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive.
7.12.374	Because heterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent), and because heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports Mendel’s observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio.
7.12.375	The equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes.
7.12.376	The physical basis of Mendel’s law of segregation is the first division of meiosis, in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei.
7.12.377	The role of the meiotic segregation of chromosomes in sexual reproduction was not understood by the scientific community during Mendel’s lifetime.
7.12.378	Independent Assortment Mendel’s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes, and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur.
7.12.379	The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross, a cross between two true-breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics.
7.12.380	Consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants, one that has green, wrinkled seeds (yyrr) and another that has yellow, round seeds (YYRR).
7.12.381	Because each parent is homozygous, the law of segregation indicates that the gametes for the green/wrinkled plant all are yr, and the gametes for the yellow/round plant are all YR.
7.12.382	Therefore, the F1 generation of offspring all are YyRr.
7.12.383	For the F2 generation, the law of segregation requires that each gamete receive either an R allele or an r allele along with either a Y allele or a y allele.
7.12.384	The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an r allele sorted would be equally likely to contain either a Y allele or a y allele.
7.12.385	Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when the YyRr heterozygote is self-crossed, as follows: YR, Yr, yR, and yr.
7.12.386	Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4 × 4 Punnett square (Figure 12.16) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations.
7.12.387	From these genotypes, we infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3 round/green:3
7.12.388	wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green (Figure 12.16).
7.12.389	These are the offspring ratios we would expect, assuming we performed the crosses with a large enough sample size.
7.12.390	Because of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into two 3:1 ratios, characteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern.
7.12.391	Ignoring seed color and considering only seed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we would expect that three quarters of the F2 generation offspring would be round, and one quarter would be wrinkled.
7.12.392	Similarly, isolating only seed color, we would assume that three quarters of the F2 offspring would be yellow and one quarter would be green.
7.12.393	The sorting of alleles for texture and color are independent events, so we can apply the product rule.
7.12.394	Therefore, the proportion of round and yellow F2 offspring is expected to be (3/4) × (3/4)
7.12.395	= 9/16, and the proportion of wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be
7.12.396	(1/4) × (1/4)
7.12.397	= 1/16.
7.12.398	These proportions are identical to those obtained using a Punnett square.
7.12.399	Round, green and wrinkled, yellow offspring can also be calculated using the product rule, as each of these genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype.
7.12.400	Therefore, the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4) × (1/4)
7.12.401	= 3/16.
7.12.402	The law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow, wrinkled (YYrr) and green, round (yyRR) parents would yield the same F1 and F2 offspring as in the YYRR x yyrr cross.
7.12.403	The physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis
7.12.404	I, in which the different homologous pairs line up in random orientations.
7.12.405	Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes (and therefore the genes on them) because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random.
7.12.406	Forked-Line Method
7.12.407	When more than two genes are being considered, the Punnett-square method becomes unwieldy.
7.12.408	For instance, examining a cross involving four genes would require a 16 × 16 grid containing 256 boxes.
7.12.409	It would be extremely cumbersome to manually enter each genotype.
7.12.410	For more complex crosses, the forked-line and probability methods are preferred.
7.12.411	To prepare a forked-line diagram for a cross between F1 heterozygotes resulting from a cross between AABBCC and aabbcc parents, we first create rows equal to the number of genes being considered, and then segregate the alleles in each row on forked lines according to the probabilities for individual monohybrid crosses (Figure 12.17).
7.12.412	We then multiply the values along each forked path to obtain the F2 offspring probabilities.
7.12.413	Note that this process is a diagrammatic version of the product rule.
7.12.414	The values along each forked pathway can be multiplied because each gene assorts independently.
7.12.415	For a trihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 27:9:9:9:3:3:3:1.
7.12.416	The forked-line method can be used to analyze a trihybrid cross.
7.12.417	Here, the probability for color in the F2 generation occupies the top row (3 yellow:1 green).
7.12.418	The probability for shape occupies the second row (3 round:1 wrinked), and the probability for height occupies the third row (3 tall:1 dwarf).
7.12.419	The probability for each possible combination of traits is calculated by multiplying the probability for each individual trait.
7.12.420	Thus, the probability of F2 offspring having yellow, round, and tall traits is 3 × 3 × 3, or 27.
7.12.421	Probability Method
7.12.422	While the forked-line method is a diagrammatic approach to keeping track of probabilities in a cross, the probability method gives the proportions of offspring expected to exhibit each phenotype (or genotype) without the added visual assistance.
7.12.423	Both methods make use of the product rule and consider the alleles for each gene separately.
7.12.424	Earlier, we examined the phenotypic proportions for a trihybrid cross using the forked-line method; now we will use the probability method to examine the genotypic proportions for a cross with even more genes.
7.12.425	For a trihybrid cross, writing out the forked-line method is tedious, albeit not as tedious as using the Punnett-square method.
7.12.426	To fully demonstrate the power of the probability method, however, we can consider specific genetic calculations.
7.12.427	For instance, for a tetrahybrid cross between individuals that are heterozygotes for all four genes, and in which all four genes are sorting independently and in a dominant and recessive pattern, what proportion of the offspring will be expected to be homozygous recessive for all four alleles?
7.12.428	Rather than writing out every possible genotype, we can use the probability method.
7.12.429	We know that for each gene, the fraction of homozygous recessive offspring will be 1/4.
7.12.430	Therefore, multiplying this fraction for each of the four genes, (1/4) ×
7.12.431	(1/4) ×
7.12.432	(1/4) × (1/4)
7.12.433	, we determine that 1/256 of the offspring will be quadruply homozygous recessive.
7.12.434	For the same tetrahybrid cross, what is the expected proportion of offspring that have the dominant phenotype at all four loci?
7.12.435	We can answer this question using phenotypic proportions, but let’s do it the hard way—using genotypic proportions.
7.12.436	The question asks for the proportion of offspring that are 1) homozygous dominant at A or heterozygous at A, and 2) homozygous at B or heterozygous at B, and so on.
7.12.437	Noting the “or” and “and” in each circumstance makes clear where to apply the sum and product rules.
7.12.438	The probability of a homozygous dominant at A is 1/4 and the probability of a heterozygote at A is 1/2.
7.12.439	The probability of the homozygote or the heterozygote is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 using the sum rule.
7.12.440	The same probability can be obtained in the same way for each of the other genes, so that the probability of a dominant phenotype at A and B and C and D is, using the product rule, equal to 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4, or 27/64.
7.12.441	If you are ever unsure about how to combine probabilities, returning to the forked-line method should make it clear.
7.12.442	Rules for Multihybrid Fertilization
7.12.443	Predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from given crosses is the best way to test your knowledge of Mendelian genetics.
7.12.444	Given a multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a dominant and recessive pattern, several generalized rules exist; you can use these rules to check your results as you work through genetics calculations (Table 12.5).
7.12.445	To apply these rules, first you must determine n, the number of heterozygous gene pairs (the number of genes segregating two alleles each).
7.12.446	For example, a cross between AaBb and AaBb heterozygotes has an n of 2.
7.12.447	In contrast, a cross between AABb and AABb has an n of 1 because A is not heterozygous.
7.12.448	Linked Genes Violate the Law of Independent Assortment
7.12.449	Although all of Mendel’s pea characteristics behaved according to the law of independent assortment, we now know that some allele combinations are not inherited independently of each other.
7.12.450	Genes that are located on separate nonhomologous chromosomes will always sort independently.
7.12.451	However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes, organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string.
7.12.452	The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage, in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair.
7.12.453	However, because of the process of recombination, or “crossover,” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently, or as if they are not linked.
7.12.454	To understand this, let’s consider the biological basis of gene linkage and recombination.
7.12.455	Homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order.
7.12.456	The alleles may differ on homologous chromosome pairs, but the genes to which they correspond do not.
7.12.457	In preparation for the first division of meiosis, homologous chromosomes replicate and synapse.
7.12.458	Like genes on the homologs align with each other.
7.12.459	At this stage, segments of homologous chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material (Figure 12.18).
7.12.460	This process is called recombination, or crossover, and it is a common genetic process.
7.12.461	Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the gene order is not altered.
7.12.462	Instead, the result of recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome.
7.12.463	Across a given chromosome, several recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of alleles.
7.12.464	The process of crossover, or recombination, occurs when two homologous chromosomes align during meiosis and exchange a segment of genetic material.
7.12.465	Here, the alleles for gene C were exchanged.
7.12.466	The result is two recombinant and two non-recombinant chromosomes.
7.12.467	When two genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, they are considered linked, and their alleles tend to be transmitted through meiosis together.
7.12.468	To exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving flower color and plant height in which the genes are next to each other on the chromosome.
7.12.469	If one homologous chromosome has alleles for tall plants and red flowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and yellow flowers, then when the gametes are formed, the tall and red alleles will go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into other gametes.
7.12.470	These are called the parental genotypes because they have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual producing gametes.
7.12.471	But unlike if the genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no gametes with tall and yellow alleles and no gametes with short and red alleles.
7.12.472	If you create the Punnett square with these gametes, you will see that the classical Mendelian prediction of a 9:3:3:1 outcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply.
7.12.473	As the distance between two genes increases, the probability of one or more crossovers between them increases, and the genes behave more like they are on separate chromosomes.
7.12.474	Geneticists have used the proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents) as a measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome.
7.12.475	Using this information, they have constructed elaborate maps of genes on chromosomes for well-studied organisms, including humans.
7.12.476	Mendel’s seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many researchers have questioned whether he encountered linkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his independent assortment postulate.
7.12.477	The garden pea has seven chromosomes, and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was not a coincidence.
7.12.478	However, even if the genes he examined were not located on separate chromosomes, it is possible that he simply did not observe linkage because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination.
7.12.479	Testing the Hypothesis of Independent Assortment
7.12.480	To better appreciate the amount of labor and ingenuity that went into Mendel’s experiments, proceed through one of Mendel’s dihybrid crosses.
7.12.481	Question: What will be the offspring of a dihybrid cross?
7.12.482	Background: Consider that pea plants mature in one growing season, and you have access to a large garden in which you can cultivate thousands of pea plants.
7.12.483	There are several true-breeding plants with the following pairs of traits: tall plants with inflated pods, and dwarf plants with constricted pods.
7.12.484	Before the plants have matured, you remove the pollen-producing organs from the tall/inflated plants in your crosses to prevent self-fertilization.
7.12.485	Upon plant maturation, the plants are manually crossed by transferring pollen from the dwarf/constricted plants to the stigmata of the tall/inflated plants.
7.12.486	Hypothesis:
7.12.487	Both trait pairs will sort independently according to Mendelian laws.
7.12.488	When the true-breeding parents are crossed, all of the F1 offspring are tall and have inflated pods, which indicates that the tall and inflated traits are dominant over the dwarf and constricted traits, respectively.
7.12.489	A self-cross of the F1 heterozygotes results in 2,000 F2 progeny.
7.12.490	Test the hypothesis: Because each trait pair sorts independently, the ratios of tall:dwarf and inflated:constricted are each expected to be 3:1.
7.12.491	The tall/dwarf trait pair is called T/t, and the inflated/ constricted trait pair is designated
7.12.492	I/i.
7.12.493	Each member of the F1 generation therefore has a genotype of TtIi.
7.12.494	Construct a grid analogous to Figure 12.16, in which you cross two TtIi individuals.
7.12.495	Each individual can donate four combinations of two traits: TI, Ti, tI, or ti, meaning that there are 16 possibilities of offspring genotypes.
7.12.496	Because the T and I alleles are dominant, any individual having one or two of those alleles will express the tall or inflated phenotypes, respectively, regardless if they also have a t or i allele.
7.12.497	Only individuals that are tt or ii will express the dwarf and constricted alleles, respectively.
7.12.498	As shown in Figure 12.19, you predict that you will observe the following offspring proportions: tall/inflated:tall/constricted:dwarf/ inflated:dwarf/constricted in a 9:3:3:1 ratio.
7.12.499	Notice from the grid that when considering the tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted trait pairs in isolation, they are each inherited in 3:1 ratios.
7.12.500	This figure shows all possible combinations of offspring resulting from a dihybrid cross of pea plants that are heterozygous for the tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted alleles.
7.12.501	Test the hypothesis
7.12.502	: You cross the dwarf and tall plants and then self-cross the offspring.
7.12.503	For best results, this is repeated with hundreds or even thousands of pea plants.
7.12.504	What special precautions should be taken in the crosses and in growing the plants?
7.12.505	Analyze your data: You observe the following plant phenotypes in the F2 generation: 2706 tall/inflated, 930 tall/constricted, 888 dwarf/inflated, and 300 dwarf/constricted.
7.12.506	Reduce these findings to a ratio and determine if they are consistent with Mendelian laws.
7.12.507	Form a conclusion
7.12.508	: Were the results close to the expected 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio?
7.12.509	Do the results support the prediction?
7.12.510	What might be observed if far fewer plants were used, given that alleles segregate randomly into gametes?
7.12.511	Try to imagine growing that many pea plants, and consider the potential for experimental error.
7.12.512	For instance, what would happen if it was extremely windy one day?
7.12.513	Epistasis
7.12.514	Mendel’s studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individual’s phenotype was controlled by genes (or as he called them, unit factors), such that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a single gene.
7.12.515	In fact, single observable characteristics are almost always under the influence of multiple genes (each with two or more alleles) acting in unison.
7.12.516	For example, at least eight genes contribute to eye color in humans.
7.12.517	In some cases, several genes can contribute to aspects of a common phenotype without their gene products ever directly interacting.
7.12.518	In the case of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially, with each gene adding to the complexity and specificity of the organ.
7.12.519	Genes may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or more genes need to be expressed simultaneously to affect a phenotype.
7.12.520	Genes may also oppose each other, with one gene modifying the expression of another.
7.12.521	In epistasis, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another.
7.12.522	“
7.12.523	Epistasis” is a word composed of Greek roots that mean “standing upon.
7.12.524	”
7.12.525	The alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking.
7.12.526	Often the biochemical basis of epistasis is a gene pathway in which the expression of one gene is dependent on the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in the pathway.
7.12.527	An example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice.
7.12.528	The wild-type coat color, agouti (AA), is dominant to solid-colored fur (aa).
7.12.529	However, a separate gene (C) is necessary for pigment production.
7.12.530	A mouse with a recessive c allele at this locus is unable to produce pigment and is albino regardless of the allele present at locus A (Figure 12.20).
7.12.531	Therefore, the genotypes AAcc, Aacc, and aacc all produce the same albino phenotype.
7.12.532	A cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaCc x AaCc) would generate offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 9 agouti:3 solid color:4 albino (Figure 12.20).
7.12.533	In this case, the C gene is epistatic to the A gene.
7.12.534	In mice, the mottled agouti coat color (A) is dominant to a solid coloration, such as black or gray.
7.12.535	A gene at a separate locus (C) is responsible for pigment production.
7.12.536	The recessive c allele does not produce pigment, and a mouse with the homozygous recessive cc genotype is albino regardless of the allele present at the A locus.
7.12.537	Thus, the C gene is epistatic to the A gene.
7.12.538	Epistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a separate gene.
7.12.539	Fruit color in summer squash is expressed in this way.
7.12.540	Homozygous recessive expression of the W gene (ww) coupled with homozygous dominant or heterozygous expression of the Y gene (YY or Yy) generates yellow fruit, and the wwyy genotype produces green fruit.
7.12.541	However, if a dominant copy of the W gene is present in the homozygous or heterozygous form, the summer squash will produce white fruit regardless of the Y alleles.
7.12.542	A cross between white heterozygotes for both genes (WwYy × WwYy) would produce offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 12 white:3 yellow:1 green.
7.12.543	Finally, epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene, when present in the dominant (or recessive) form, expresses the same phenotype.
7.12.544	In the shepherd’s purse plant (Capsella bursa-pastoris), the characteristic of seed shape is controlled by two genes in a dominant epistatic relationship.
7.12.545	When the genes A and B are both homozygous recessive (aabb), the seeds are ovoid.
7.12.546	If the dominant allele for either of these genes is present, the result is triangular seeds.
7.12.547	That is, every possible genotype other than aabb results in triangular seeds, and a cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaBb x AaBb) would yield offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 15 triangular:1 ovoid.
7.12.548	As you work through genetics problems, keep in mind that any single characteristic that results in a phenotypic ratio that totals 16 is typical of a two-gene interaction.
7.12.549	Recall the phenotypic inheritance pattern for Mendel’s dihybrid cross, which considered two non-interacting genes—9:3:3:1.
7.12.550	Similarly, we would expect interacting gene pairs to also exhibit ratios expressed as 16 parts.
7.12.551	Note that we are assuming the interacting genes are not linked; they are still assorting independently into gametes.
7.13.0	Chromosomes are threadlike nuclear structures consisting of DNA and proteins that serve as the repositories for genetic information.
7.13.1	The chromosomes depicted here were isolated from a fruit fly’s salivary gland, stained with dye, and visualized under a microscope.
7.13.2	Akin to miniature bar codes, chromosomes absorb different dyes to produce characteristic banding patterns, which allows for their routine identification.
7.13.3	Introduction
7.13.4	The gene is the physical unit of inheritance, and genes are arranged in a linear order on chromosomes.
7.13.5	The behaviors and interactions of chromosomes during meiosis explain, at a cellular level, the patterns of inheritance that we observe in populations.
7.13.6	Genetic disorders involving alterations in chromosome number or structure may have dramatic effects and can prevent a fertilized egg from developing altogether.
7.13.7	studying heredity in 1843.With the improvement of microscopic techniques during the late 1800s, cell biologists could stain and visualize subcellular structures with dyes and observe their actions during cell division and meiosis.
7.13.8	With each mitotic division, chromosomes replicated, condensed from an amorphous (no constant shape) nuclear mass into distinct X-shaped bodies (pairs of identical sister chromatids), and migrated to separate cellular poles.
7.13.9	Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
7.13.10	The speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists to examine Mendel’s publications and re-evaluate his model in terms of the behavior of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis.
7.13.11	In 1902, Theodor Boveri observed that proper embryonic development of sea urchins does not occur unless chromosomes are present.
7.13.12	That same year, Walter Sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis (Figure 13.2).
7.13.13	Together, these observations led to the development of the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian inheritance.
7.13.14	(a)
7.13.15	Walter Sutton and (b)
7.13.16	Theodor Boveri are credited with developing the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which states that chromosomes carry the unit of heredity (genes).
7.13.17	The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendel’s laws and was supported by the following observations:
7.13.18	•
7.13.19	During meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete structures that are independent of other chromosome pairs.
7.13.20	•
7.13.21	The sorting of chromosomes from each homologous pair into pre-gametes appears to be random.
7.13.22	•
7.13.23	Each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half of their chromosomal complement.
7.13.24	•
7.13.25	Even though male and female gametes (sperm and egg) differ in size and morphology, they have the same number of chromosomes, suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent.
7.13.26	•
7.13.27	The gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce offspring with the same chromosome number as their parents.
7.13.28	Despite compelling correlations between the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and Mendel’s abstract laws, the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was proposed long before there was any direct evidence that traits were carried on chromosomes.
7.13.29	Critics pointed out that individuals had far more independently segregating traits than they had chromosomes.
7.13.30	It was only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, that Thomas Hunt Morgan provided experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance.
7.13.31	Genetic Linkage and
7.13.32	Distances Mendel’s work suggested that traits are inherited independently of each other.
7.13.33	Morgan identified a 1:1 correspondence between a segregating trait and the X chromosome, suggesting that the random segregation of chromosomes was the physical basis of Mendel’s model.
7.13.34	This also demonstrated that linked genes disrupt Mendel’s predicted outcomes.
7.13.35	The fact that each chromosome can carry many linked genes explains how individuals can have many more traits than they have chromosomes.
7.13.36	However, observations by researchers in Morgan’s laboratory suggested that alleles positioned on the same chromosome were not always inherited together.
7.13.37	During meiosis, linked genes somehow became unlinked.
7.13.38	Homologous Recombination
7.13.39	In 1909, Frans Janssen observed chiasmata—the point at which chromatids are in contact with each other and may exchange segments
7.13.40	—prior to the first division of meiosis.
7.13.41	He suggested that alleles become unlinked and chromosomes physically exchange segments.
7.13.42	As chromosomes condensed and paired with their homologs, they appeared to interact at distinct points.
7.13.43	Janssen suggested that these points corresponded to regions in which chromosome segments were exchanged.
7.13.44	It is now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes, known as synapsis, does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells.
7.13.45	When synapsed, homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous recombination, or more simply, “crossing over.
7.13.46	”
7.13.47	To better understand the type of experimental results that researchers were obtaining at this time, consider a heterozygous individual that inherited dominant maternal alleles for two genes on the same chromosome (such as AB) and two recessive paternal alleles for those same genes (such as ab).
7.13.48	If the genes are linked, one would expect this individual to produce gametes that are either AB or ab with a 1:1 ratio.
7.13.49	If the genes are unlinked, the individual should produce AB, Ab, aB, and ab gametes with equal frequencies, according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment.
7.13.50	Because they correspond to new allele combinations, the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis.
7.13.51	Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents.
7.13.52	Morgan and his colleagues, however, found that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous recessive parent (AaBb × aabb), both parental and nonparental cases occurred.
7.13.53	For example, 950 offspring might be recovered that were either AaBb or aabb, but 50 offspring would also be obtained that were either Aabb or aaBb.
7.13.54	These results suggested that linkage occurred most often, but a significant minority of offspring were the products of recombination.
7.13.55	Inheritance patterns of unlinked and linked genes are shown.
7.13.56	In (a), two genes are located on different chromosomes so independent assortment occurs during meiosis.
7.13.57	The offspring have an equal chance of being the parental type (inheriting the same combination of traits as the parents) or a nonparental type (inheriting a different combination of traits than the parents).
7.13.58	In (b), two genes are very close together on the same chromosome so that no crossing over occurs between them.
7.13.59	The genes are therefore always inherited together and all of the offspring are the parental type.
7.13.60	In (c), two genes are far apart on the chromosome such that crossing over occurs during every meiotic event.
7.13.61	The recombination frequency will be the same as if the genes were on separate chromosomes.
7.13.62	(d)
7.13.63	The actual recombination frequency of fruit fly wing length and body color that Thomas Morgan observed in 1912 was 17 percent.
7.13.64	A crossover frequency between 0 percent and 50 percent indicates that the genes are on the same chromosome and crossover occurs some of the time.
7.13.65	Genetic Maps Janssen did not have the technology to demonstrate crossing over so it remained an abstract idea that was not widely accepted.
7.13.66	Scientists thought chiasmata were a variation on synapsis and could not understand how chromosomes could break and rejoin.
7.13.67	Yet, the data were clear that linkage did not always occur.
7.13.68	Ultimately, it took a young undergraduate student and an “all-nighter” to mathematically elucidate the problem of linkage and recombination.
7.13.69	In 1913, Alfred Sturtevant, a student in Morgan’s laboratory, gathered results from researchers in the laboratory, and took them home one night to mull them over.
7.13.70	By the next morning, he had created the first “chromosome map,” a linear representation of gene order and relative distance on a chromosome.
7.13.71	As shown in Figure 13.4, by using recombination frequency to predict genetic distance, the relative order of genes on chromosome 2 could be inferred.
7.13.72	The values shown represent map distances in centimorgans (cM), which correspond to recombination frequencies (in percent).
7.13.73	Therefore, the genes for body color and wing size were 65.5 − 48.5
7.13.74	= 17 cM apart, indicating that the maternal and paternal alleles for these genes recombine in 17 percent of offspring, on average.
7.13.75	To construct a chromosome map, Sturtevant assumed that genes were ordered serially on threadlike chromosomes.
7.13.76	He also assumed that the incidence of recombination between two homologous chromosomes could occur with equal likelihood anywhere along the length of the chromosome.
7.13.77	Operating under these assumptions, Sturtevant postulated that alleles that were far apart on a chromosome were more likely to dissociate during meiosis simply because there was a larger region over which recombination could occur.
7.13.78	Conversely, alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together.
7.13.79	The average number of crossovers between two alleles—that is, their recombination frequency—correlated with their genetic distance from each other, relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome.
7.13.80	Considering the example cross between AaBb and aabb above, the frequency of recombination could be calculated as 50/1000 = 0.05.
7.13.81	That is, the likelihood of a crossover between
7.13.82	genes A/a and B/b was 0.05, or 5 percent.
7.13.83	Such a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked, but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur.
7.13.84	Sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units, or centimorgans (cM), in which a recombination frequency of 0.01 corresponds to 1 cM.
7.13.85	By representing alleles in a linear map, Sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked (recombination frequency = 0) to being perfectly unlinked (recombination frequency = 0.5) when genes are on different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome.
7.13.86	Perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the frequencies predicted by Mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross.
7.13.87	A recombination frequency of 0.5 indicates that 50 percent of offspring are recombinants and the other 50 percent are parental types.
7.13.88	That is, every type of allele combination is represented with equal frequency.
7.13.89	This representation allowed Sturtevant to additively calculate distances between several genes on the same chromosome.
7.13.90	However, as the genetic distances approached 0.50, his predictions became less accurate because it was not clear whether the genes were very far apart on the same chromosome or on different chromosomes.
7.13.91	In 1931, Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton demonstrated the crossover of homologous chromosomes in corn plants.
7.13.92	Weeks later, homologous recombination in Drosophila was demonstrated microscopically by Curt Stern.
7.13.93	Stern observed several X-linked phenotypes that were associated with a structurally unusual and dissimilar X chromosome pair in which one X was missing a small terminal segment, and the other X was fused to a piece of the Y chromosome.
7.13.94	By crossing flies, observing their offspring, and then visualizing the offspring’s chromosomes, Stern demonstrated that every time the offspring allele combination deviated from either of the parental combinations, there was a corresponding exchange of an X chromosome segment.
7.13.95	Using mutant flies with structurally distinct X chromosomes was the key to observing the products of recombination because DNA sequencing and other molecular tools were not yet available.
7.13.96	It is now known that homologous chromosomes regularly exchange segments in meiosis by reciprocally breaking and rejoining their DNA at precise locations.
7.13.97	Mendel’s Mapped Traits Homologous recombination is a common genetic process, yet Mendel never observed it.
7.13.98	Had he investigated both linked and unlinked genes, it would have been much more difficult for him to create a unified model of his data on the basis of probabilistic calculations.
7.13.99	Researchers who have since mapped the seven traits investigated by Mendel onto the seven chromosomes of the pea plant genome have confirmed that all of the genes he examined are either on separate chromosomes or are sufficiently far apart as to be statistically unlinked.
7.13.100	Some have suggested that Mendel was enormously lucky to select only unlinked genes, whereas others question whether Mendel discarded any data suggesting linkage.
7.13.101	In any case, Mendel consistently observed independent assortment because he examined genes that were effectively unlinked.
7.13.102	Inherited disorders can arise when chromosomes behave abnormally during meiosis.
7.13.103	Chromosome disorders can be divided into two categories: abnormalities in chromosome number and chromosomal structural rearrangements.
7.13.104	Because even small segments of chromosomes can span many genes, chromosomal disorders are characteristically dramatic and often fatal.
7.13.105	Identification of Chromosomes
7.13.106	The isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method by which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans.
7.13.107	A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes, and includes their length, banding pattern, and centromere position.
7.13.108	To obtain a view of an individual’s karyotype, cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart, or karyogram, also known as an ideogram.
7.13.109	This karyotype is of a female human.
7.13.110	Notice that homologous chromosomes are the same size, and have the same centromere positions and banding patterns.
7.13.111	A human male would have an XY chromosome pair instead of the XX pair shown.
7.13.112	(credit:
7.13.113	Andreas Blozer et al)
7.13.114	In a given species, chromosomes can be identified by their number, size, centromere position, and banding pattern.
7.13.115	In a human karyotype, autosomes or “body chromosomes” (all of the non–sex chromosomes) are generally organized in approximate order of size from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22).
7.13.116	The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes.
7.13.117	However, chromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome 22.
7.13.118	This was discovered after the naming of Down syndrome as trisomy 21, reflecting how this disease results from possessing one extra chromosome 21 (three total).
7.13.119	Not wanting to change the name of this important disease, chromosome 21 retained its numbering, despite describing the shortest set of chromosomes.
7.13.120	The chromosome “arms” projecting from either end of the centromere may be designated as short or long, depending on their relative lengths.
7.13.121	The short arm is abbreviated p (for “petite”), whereas the long arm is abbreviated q (because it follows “p” alphabetically).
7.13.122	Each arm is further subdivided and denoted by a number.
7.13.123	Using this naming system, locations on chromosomes can be described consistently in the scientific literature.
7.13.124	Geneticists Use Karyograms to Identify Chromosomal Aberrations
7.13.125	Although Mendel is referred to as the “father of modern genetics,” he performed his experiments with none of the tools that the geneticists of today routinely employ.
7.13.126	One such powerful cytological technique is karyotyping, a method in which traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities can be identified from a single cell.
7.13.127	To observe an individual’s karyotype, a person’s cells (like white blood cells) are first collected from a blood sample or other tissue.
7.13.128	In the laboratory, the isolated cells are stimulated to begin actively dividing.
7.13.129	A chemical called colchicine is then applied to cells to arrest condensed chromosomes in metaphase.
7.13.130	Cells are then made to swell using a hypotonic solution so the chromosomes spread apart.
7.13.131	Finally, the sample is preserved in a fixative and applied to a slide.
7.13.132	The geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize the distinct and reproducible banding patterns of each chromosome pair.
7.13.133	Following staining, the chromosomes are viewed using bright-field microscopy.
7.13.134	A common stain choice is the Giemsa stain.
7.13.135	Giemsa staining results in approximately 400–800 bands (of tightly coiled DNA and condensed proteins) arranged along all of the 23 chromosome pairs; an experienced geneticist can identify each band.
7.13.136	In addition to the banding patterns, chromosomes are further identified on the basis of size and centromere location.
7.13.137	To obtain the classic depiction of the karyotype in which homologous pairs of chromosomes are aligned in numerical order from longest to shortest, the geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually arranges the chromosomes into this pattern (Figure 13.5).
7.13.138	At its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or too few chromosomes per cell.
7.13.139	Examples of this are Down Syndrome, which is identified by a third copy of chromosome 21, and Turner Syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of only one X chromosome in women instead of the normal two.
7.13.140	Geneticists can also identify large deletions or insertions of DNA.
7.13.141	For instance, Jacobsen Syndrome—which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects—is identified by a deletion on chromosome 11.
7.13.142	Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint translocations, which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome.
7.13.143	Translocations are implicated in certain cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia.
7.13.144	During Mendel’s lifetime, inheritance was an abstract concept that could only be inferred by performing crosses and observing the traits expressed by offspring.
7.13.145	By observing a karyogram, today’s geneticists can actually visualize the chromosomal composition of an individual to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities in offspring, even before birth.
7.13.146	Disorders in Chromosome Number
7.13.147	Of all of the chromosomal disorders, abnormalities in chromosome number are the most obviously identifiable from a karyogram.
7.13.148	Disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes, as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes.
7.13.149	They are caused by nondisjunction, which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis.
7.13.150	Misaligned or incomplete synapsis, or a dysfunction of the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration, can cause nondisjunction.
7.13.151	The risk of nondisjunction occurring increases with the age of the parents.
7.13.152	Nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis I or II, with differing results (Figure 13.6).
7.13.153	If homologous chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis
7.13.154	I, the result is two gametes that lack that particular chromosome and two gametes with two copies of the chromosome.
7.13.155	If sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis II, the result is one gamete that lacks that chromosome, two normal gametes with one copy of the chromosome, and one gamete with two copies of the chromosome.
7.13.156	Aneuploidy
7.13.157	An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid; in humans, euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.
7.13.158	An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid, a term that includes monosomy (loss of one chromosome) or trisomy (gain of an extraneous chromosome).
7.13.159	Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes.
7.13.160	This underscores the importance of “gene dosage” in humans.
7.13.161	Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop to birth; however, duplications of some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several weeks to many years.
7.13.162	Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose.
7.13.163	Individuals with an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products encoded by that chromosome.
7.13.164	This extra dose (150 percent) of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and often precludes development.
7.13.165	The most common trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21, which corresponds to Down Syndrome.
7.13.166	Individuals with this inherited disorder are characterized by short stature and stunted digits, facial distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays.
7.13.167	The incidence of Down syndrome is correlated with maternal age; older women are more likely to become pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype.
7.13.168	An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called polyploid.
7.13.169	For instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote.
7.13.170	Polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards.
7.13.171	Polyploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces mostly aneuploid daughter cells that cannot yield viable zygotes.
7.13.172	Rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in which an unfertilized egg divides mitotically to produce offspring.
7.13.173	In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species (Figure 13.8).
7.13.174	The incidence of having a fetus with trisomy 21 increases dramatically with maternal age.
7.13.175	As with many polyploid plants, this triploid orange daylily (Hemerocallis fulva) is particularly large and robust, and grows flowers with triple the number of petals of its diploid counterparts.

7.13.177	Sex Chromosome Nondisjunction in Humans Humans display dramatic deleterious effects with autosomal trisomies and monosomies.
7.13.178	Therefore, it may seem counterintuitive that human females and males can function normally, despite carrying different numbers of the X chromosome.
7.13.179	Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes, variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects.
7.13.180	In part, this occurs because of a molecular process called X inactivation.
7.13.181	Early in development, when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells (relative to trillions in the newborn), one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent (dormant) structure called a Barr body.
7.13.182	The chance that an X chromosome (maternally or paternally derived) is inactivated in each cell is random, but once the inactivation occurs, all cells derived from that one will have the same inactive X chromosome or Barr body.
7.13.183	By this process, females compensate for their double genetic dose of X chromosome.
7.13.184	In so-called “tortoiseshell” cats, embryonic X inactivation is observed as color variegation (Figure 13.9).
7.13.185	Females that are heterozygous for an X-linked coat color gene will express one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body, corresponding to whichever X chromosome is inactivated in the embryonic cell progenitor of that region.
7.13.186	In cats, the gene for coat color is located on the X chromosome.
7.13.187	In the embryonic development of female cats, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in each cell, resulting in a tortoiseshell pattern if the cat has two different alleles for coat color.
7.13.188	Male cats, having only one X chromosome, never exhibit a tortoiseshell coat color.
7.13.189	(credit: Michael Bodega)
7.13.190	An individual carrying an abnormal number of X chromosomes will inactivate all but one X chromosome in each of her cells.
7.13.191	However, even inactivated X chromosomes continue to express a few genes, and X chromosomes must reactivate for the proper maturation of female ovaries.
7.13.192	As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with mild mental and physical defects, as well as sterility.
7.13.193	If the X chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop in utero.
7.13.194	Several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized.
7.13.195	Individuals with three X chromosomes, called triplo- X, are phenotypically female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility.
7.13.196	The XXY genotype, corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to phenotypically male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and reduced body hair.
7.13.197	More complex types of Klinefelter syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five X chromosomes.
7.13.198	In all types, every X chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic dosage.
7.13.199	This can be seen as several Barr bodies in each cell nucleus.
7.13.200	Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 genotype (i.e., only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.
7.13.201	Duplications and Deletions
7.13.202	In addition to the loss or gain of an entire chromosome, a chromosomal segment may be duplicated or lost.
7.13.203	Duplications and deletions often produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental abnormalities.
7.13.204	Duplicated chromosomal segments may fuse to existing chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus.
7.13.205	Cri-du-chat (from the French for “cry of the cat”) is a syndrome associated with nervous system abnormalities and identifiable physical features that result from a deletion of most of 5p (the small arm of chromosome 5)
7.13.206	(Figure 13.10).
7.13.207	Infants with this genotype emit a characteristic high-pitched cry on which the disorder’s name is based.
7.13.208	This individual with cri-du-chat syndrome is shown at two, four, nine, and 12 years of age.
7.13.209	Chromosomal Structural Rearrangements Cytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in chromosomes, but chromosome inversions and translocations are the most common.
7.13.210	Both are identified during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of rearranged chromosomes with their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment.
7.13.211	If the genes carried on two homologs are not oriented correctly, a recombination event could result in the loss of genes from one chromosome and the gain of genes on the other.
7.13.212	This would produce aneuploid gametes.
7.13.213	Chromosome Inversions
7.13.214	A chromosome inversion is the detachment, 180° rotation, and reinsertion of part of a chromosome.
7.13.215	Inversions may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear, or from the action of transposable elements (special DNA sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences).
7.13.216	Unless they disrupt a gene sequence, inversions only change the orientation of genes and are likely to have more mild effects than aneuploid errors.
7.13.217	However, altered gene orientation can result in functional changes because regulators of gene expression could be moved out of position with respect to their targets, causing aberrant levels of gene products.
7.13.218	An inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere, or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere (Figure 13.11).
7.13.219	A pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms, making these inversions easily identifiable.
7.13.220	Pericentric inversions include the centromere, and paracentric inversions do not.
7.13.221	A pericentric inversion can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms; a paracentric inversion cannot.
7.13.222	When one homologous chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not, the individual is described as an inversion heterozygote.
7.13.223	To maintain point-for-point synapsis during meiosis, one homolog must form a loop, and the other homolog must mold around it.
7.13.224	Although this topology can ensure that the genes are correctly aligned, it also forces the homologs to stretch and can be associated with regions of imprecise synapsis.
7.13.225	When one chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not, one chromosome must form an inverted loop to retain point-for-point interaction during synapsis.
7.13.226	This inversion pairing is essential to maintaining gene alignment during meiosis and to allow for recombination.
7.13.227	The Chromosome 18 Inversion Not all structural rearrangements of chromosomes produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals.
7.13.228	In rare instances, such a change can result in the evolution of a new species.
7.13.229	In fact, a pericentric inversion in chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to the evolution of humans.
7.13.230	This inversion is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees.
7.13.231	Humans and chimpanzees differ cytogenetically by pericentric inversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in chimpanzees that correspond to chromosome two in humans.
7.13.232	The pericentric chromosome 18 inversion is believed to have occurred in early humans following their divergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago.
7.13.233	Researchers characterizing this inversion have suggested that approximately 19,000 nucleotide bases were duplicated on 18p, and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on chromosome 18 of an ancestral human.
7.13.234	A comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two genes—ROCK1 and USP14—that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to human chromosome 18) are more distantly positioned on human chromosome 18.
7.13.235	This suggests that one of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes.
7.13.236	Interestingly, humans and chimpanzees express USP14 at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and fibroblasts.
7.13.237	Perhaps the chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression levels in a useful way.
7.13.238	Because both ROCK1 and USP14 encode cellular enzymes, a change in their expression could alter cellular function.
7.13.239	It is not known how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution, but it appears to be a significant factor in the divergence of humans from other primates.
7.13.240	Translocations
7.13.241	A translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome.
7.13.242	Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences.
7.13.243	Notably, specific translocations have been associated with several cancers and with schizophrenia.
7.13.244	Reciprocal translocations result from the exchange of chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no gain or loss of genetic information.
7.13.245	A reciprocal translocation occurs when a segment of DNA is transferred from one chromosome to another, nonhomologous chromosome.  
7.14.0	Introduction
7.14.1	The three letters “DNA” have now become synonymous with crime solving, paternity testing, human identification, and genetic testing.
7.14.2	DNA can be retrieved from hair, blood, or saliva.
7.14.3	Each person’s DNA is unique, and it is possible to detect differences between individuals within a species on the basis of these unique features.
7.14.4	DNA analysis has many practical applications beyond forensics.
7.14.5	In humans, DNA testing is applied to numerous uses: determining paternity, tracing genealogy, identifying pathogens, archeological research, tracing disease outbreaks, and studying human migration patterns.
7.14.6	In the medical field, DNA is used in diagnostics, new vaccine development, and cancer therapy.
7.14.7	It is now possible to determine predisposition to diseases by looking at genes.
7.14.8	Each human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes: one set of chromosomes is inherited from the mother and the other set is inherited from the father.
7.14.9	There is also a mitochondrial genome, inherited exclusively from the mother, which can be involved in inherited genetic disorders.
7.14.10	On each chromosome, there are thousands of genes that are responsible for determining the genotype and phenotype of the individual.
7.14.11	A gene is defined as a sequence of DNA that codes for a functional product.
7.14.12	The human haploid genome contains 3 billion base pairs and has between 20,000 and 25,000 functional genes.
7.14.13	Modern understandings of DNA have evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix model.
7.14.14	In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (Figure 14.2), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphaterich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes.
7.14.15	He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.
7.14.16	A half century later, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “horizontally,” rather than by descent.
7.14.17	In 1928, he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation, a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing morphology and physiology.
7.14.18	He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterium that causes pneumonia.
7.14.19	Griffith worked with two strains, rough (R) and smooth (S).
7.14.20	The R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease) and is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule; as a result, the cell surface appears uneven under the microscope.
7.14.21	The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing) and has a capsule outside its cell wall.
7.14.22	As a result, it has a smooth appearance under the microscope.
7.14.23	Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and they survived.
7.14.24	In another experiment, when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain, they also survived.
7.14.25	In a third set of experiments, a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into mice, and—to his surprise—
7.14.26	the mice died.
7.14.27	Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S strain of bacteria was recovered.
7.14.28	When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice, the mice died.
7.14.29	Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and transformed it into the pathogenic S strain, and he called this the transforming principle (Figure 14.3).
7.14.30	These experiments are now famously known as Griffith's transformation experiments.
7.14.31	Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used in Griffith’s transformation experiments.
7.14.32	The R strain is nonpathogenic.
7.14.33	The S strain is pathogenic and causes death.
7.14.34	When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain and a live R strain, the mouse died.
7.14.35	The S strain was recovered from the dead mouse.
7.14.36	Thus, Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain, transforming the R strain into S strain in the process.
7.14.37	(credit "living mouse": modification of work by NIH; credit "dead mouse": modification of work by Sarah Marriage)
7.14.38	Scientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming principle further.
7.14.39	They isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic acids, namely RNA and DNA, as these were possible candidates for the molecule of heredity.
7.14.40	They conducted a systematic elimination study.
7.14.41	They used enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then used each mixture separately to transform the R strain.
7.14.42	They found that when DNA was degraded, the resulting mixture was no longer able to transform the bacteria, whereas all of the other combinations were able to transform the bacteria.
7.14.43	This led them to conclude that DNA was the transforming principle.
7.14.44	Forensic Scientists and DNA Analysis DNA evidence was used for the first time to solve an immigration case.
7.14.45	The story started with a teenage boy returning to London from Ghana to be with his mother.
7.14.46	Immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious of him, thinking that he was traveling on a forged passport.
7.14.47	After much persuasion, he was allowed to go live with his mother, but the immigration authorities did not drop the case against him.
7.14.48	All types of evidence, including photographs, were provided to the authorities, but deportation proceedings were started nevertheless.
7.14.49	Around the same time, Dr. Alec Jeffreys of Leicester University in the United Kingdom had invented a technique known as DNA fingerprinting.
7.14.50	The immigration authorities approached Dr. Jeffreys for help.
7.14.51	He took DNA samples from the mother and three of her children, plus an unrelated mother, and compared the samples with the boy’s DNA.
7.14.52	Because the biological father was not in the picture, DNA from the three children was compared with the boy’s DNA.
7.14.53	He found a match in the boy’s DNA for both the mother and his three siblings.
7.14.54	He concluded that the boy was indeed the mother’s son.
7.14.55	Forensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological samples.
7.14.56	They analyze the DNA content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database of DNA profiles of known criminals.
7.14.57	Analysis includes DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis; most forensic DNA analysis involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of short tandem repeat (STR) loci and electrophoresis to determine the length of the PCR-amplified fragment.
7.14.58	Only mitochondrial DNA is sequenced for forensics.
7.14.59	Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to present their findings.
7.14.60	They are usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies.
7.14.61	Geneticists experimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college and university labs.
7.14.62	Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience working in a laboratory.
7.14.63	material, either DNA or RNA.
7.14.64	The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell.
7.14.65	The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number of bacteriophages.
7.14.66	Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur, 35S, to label the protein coat.
7.14.67	Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus, 32P. Because phosphorous is found in DNA, but not protein, the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus.
7.14.68	Each batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately.
7.14.69	After infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a blender, which caused the phage coat to be detached from the host cell.
7.14.70	The phage and bacterial suspension was spun down in a centrifuge.
7.14.71	The heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in the supernatant.
7.14.72	In the tube that contained phage labeled with 35S, the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage, whereas no radioactivity was detected in the pellet.
7.14.73	In the tube that contained the phage labeled with 32P, the radioactivity was detected in the pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant.
7.14.74	Hershey and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected into the cell and carried information to produce more phage particles, thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins.
7.14.75	In Hershey and Chase's experiments, bacteria were infected with phage radiolabeled with either 35S, which labels protein, or 32P, which labels DNA.
7.14.76	Only 32P entered the bacterial cells, indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
7.14.77	Around this same time, Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the content of DNA in different species and found that the amounts of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that it varied from species to species, but not between individuals of the same species.
7.14.78	He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G
7.14.79	= C. This is also known as Chargaff’s rules.
7.14.80	This finding proved immensely useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA double helix model.
7.14.81	DNA Structure and Sequencing
7.14.82	The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides.
7.14.83	The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous base, deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group (Figure 14.5).
7.14.84	The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous base.
7.14.85	The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and thymine (T).
7.14.86	The nucleotides combine with each other by covalent bonds known as phosphodiester bonds or linkages.
7.14.87	The purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring.
7.14.88	Pyrimidines are smaller in size; they have a single six-membered ring structure.
7.14.89	The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5' (1' is read as “one prime”).
7.14.90	The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5' carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide and the hydroxyl group of the 3' carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3' phosphodiester bond.
7.14.91	In the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of Cambridge, England.
7.14.92	Other scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively exploring this field.
7.14.93	Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography.
7.14.94	InWilkins’ lab, researcher Rosalind Franklin was using X-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of DNA.
7.14.95	Watson and Crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the DNA molecule on the basis of Franklin's data because Crick had also studied X-ray diffraction (Figure 14.6).
7.14.96	In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.
7.14.97	Unfortunately, by then Franklin had died, and Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously.
7.14.98	Each nucleotide is made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.
7.14.99	The sugar is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA.
7.14.100	The work of pioneering scientists (a) James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty led to our present day understanding of DNA.
7.14.101	Scientist Rosalind Franklin discovered (b) the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA, which helped to elucidate its double helix structure.
7.14.102	(credit a: modification of work by Marjorie McCarty, Public Library of Science)
7.14.103	Watson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix.
7.14.104	Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine; namely, A pairs with T and G pairs with C. Adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs.
7.14.105	The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds.
7.14.106	The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, the 3' end of one strand faces the 5' end of the other strand.
7.14.107	The sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure, whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside.
7.14.108	Each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of 0.34 nm, and each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm.
7.14.109	Therefore, ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix.
7.14.110	The diameter of the DNA double helix is 2 nm, and it is uniform throughout.
7.14.111	Only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter.
7.14.112	The twisting of the two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves.
7.14.113	DNA has (a) a double helix structure and (b) phosphodiester bonds.
7.14.114	The (c) major and minor grooves are binding sites for DNA binding proteins during processes such as transcription (the copying of RNA from DNA) and replication.
7.14.115	DNA Sequencing Techniques Until the 1990s, the sequencing of DNA (reading the sequence of DNA) was a relatively expensive and long process.
7.14.116	Using radiolabeled nucleotides also compounded the problem through safety concerns.
7.14.117	With currently available technology and automated machines, the process is cheap, safer, and can be completed in a matter of hours.
7.14.118	Fred Sanger developed the sequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project, which is widely used today.
7.14.119	The method is known as the dideoxy chain termination method.
7.14.120	The sequencing method is based on the use of chain terminators, the dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs).
7.14.121	The dideoxynucleotides, or ddNTPSs, differ from the deoxynucleotides by the lack of a free 3' OH group on the five-carbon sugar.
7.14.122	If a ddNTP is added to a growing a DNA strand, the chain is not extended any further because the free 3' OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available.
7.14.123	By using a predetermined ratio of deoxyribonucleotides to dideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA fragments of different sizes.
7.14.124	In Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method, dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides are used to generate DNA fragments that terminate at different points.
7.14.125	The DNA is separated by capillary electrophoresis on the basis of size, and from the order of fragments formed, the DNA sequence can be read.
7.14.126	The DNA sequence readout is shown on an electropherogram that is generated by a laser scanner.
7.14.127	The DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured or separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures.
7.14.128	The DNA is divided into four tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) are added.
7.14.129	In addition to each of the four tubes, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleotides are added to each tube respectively.
7.14.130	The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added.
7.14.131	For detection purposes, each of the four dideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label.
7.14.132	Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide is incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place.
7.14.133	After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed.
7.14.134	Even a difference in length of a single base can be detected.
7.14.135	The sequence is read from a laser scanner.
7.14.136	For his work on DNA sequencing, Sanger received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1980.
7.14.137	Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes.
7.14.138	Usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose.
7.14.139	Agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated.
7.14.140	After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray.
7.14.141	Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied.
7.14.142	The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode.
7.14.143	The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the well (where the DNA was loaded), and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest to the well.
7.14.144	Once the DNA is separated, the gel is stained with a DNA-specific dye for viewing it.
7.14.145	DNA can be separated on the basis of size using gel electrophoresis.
7.14.146	Neanderthal Genome:
7.14.147	How Are We Related?
7.14.148	The first draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was recently published by Richard E. Green et al. in 2010.
7.14.149	[1] Neanderthals are the closest ancestors of present-day humans.
7.14.150	They were known to have lived in Europe and Western Asia before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years ago.
7.14.151	Green’s team studied almost 40,000-year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across the world.
7.14.152	Extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA sequencing were employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination.
7.14.153	In their study, the scientists were able to sequence some four billion base pairs.
7.14.154	The Neanderthal sequence was compared with that of present-day humans from across the world.
7.14.155	After comparing the sequences, the researchers found that the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than to people in Africa.
7.14.156	While current theories have suggested that all present-day humans can be traced to a small ancestral population in Africa, the data from the Neanderthal genome may contradict this view.
7.14.157	Green and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are more similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences.
7.14.158	Another interesting observation was that Neanderthals are as closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those from China or France.
7.14.159	This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been located only in Europe and West Asia.
7.14.160	Most likely, genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and modern humans as modern humans emerged out of Africa, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and Papua New Guineans.
7.14.161	Several genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during the evolution of presentday humans.
7.14.162	These genes are involved in cranial structure, metabolism, skin morphology, and cognitive development.
7.14.163	One of the genes that is of particular interest is RUNX2, which is different in modern day humans and Neanderthals.
7.14.164	This gene is responsible for the prominent frontal bone, bell-shaped rib cage, and dental differences seen in Neanderthals.
7.14.165	It is speculated that an evolutionary change in RUNX2 was important in the origin of modern-day humans, and this affected the cranium and the upper body.
7.14.166	DNA Packaging in Cells
7.14.167	When comparing prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features (Figure 14.10).
7.14.168	Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.
7.14.169	A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus, whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in the cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid.
7.14.170	In eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate compartment from protein synthesis.
7.14.171	In prokaryotic cells, both processes occur together.
7.14.172	What advantages might there be to separating the processes?
7.14.173	What advantages might there be to having them occur together?
7.14.174	The size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, E.coli, is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut and stretched out).
7.14.175	So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell?
7.14.176	The DNA is twisted by what is known as supercoiling.
7.14.177	Supercoiling means that DNA is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or over-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state.
7.14.178	Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.
7.14.179	Eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their DNA inside the nucleus (Figure 14.11).
7.14.180	At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes.
7.14.181	The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an octamer.
7.14.182	The DNA (which is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around the histone core.
7.14.183	This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA.
7.14.184	This is also known as the “beads on a string” structure.
7.14.185	This is further compacted into a 30 nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure.
7.14.186	At the metaphase stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact, are approximately 700 nm in width, and are found in association with scaffold proteins.
7.14.187	In interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining.
7.14.188	The tightly packaged region is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin.
7.14.189	Heterochromatin usually contains genes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres.
7.14.190	The euchromatin usually contains genes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.
7.14.191	Basics of DNA Replication
7.14.192	The elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself.
7.14.193	This model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied.
7.14.194	What was not clear was how the replication took place.
7.14.195	There were three models suggested (Figure 14.12): conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.
7.14.196	The three suggested models of DNA replication.
7.14.197	Grey indicates the original DNA strands, and blue indicates newly synthesized DNA.
7.14.198	In conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together.
7.14.199	The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand.
7.14.200	In the dispersive model, both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed.
7.14.201	Meselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates.
7.14.202	They grew E. coli for several generations in a medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (15N) that gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into the DNA.
7.14.203	Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown in 15N (red band) is heavier than DNA grown in 14N (orange band), and sediments to a lower level in cesium chloride solution in an ultracentrifuge.
7.14.204	When DNA grown in 15N is switched to media containing 14N, after one round of cell division the DNA sediments halfway between the 15N and 14N levels, indicating that it now contains fifty percent 14N.
7.14.205	In subsequent cell divisions, an increasing amount of DNA contains 14N only.
7.14.206	This data supports the semi-conservative replication model.
7.14.207	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.14.208	The E. coli culture was then shifted into medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for one generation.
7.14.209	The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated.
7.14.210	The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge.
7.14.211	Some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14N and spun again.
7.14.212	During the density gradient centrifugation, the DNA is loaded into a gradient (typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm.
7.14.213	Under these circumstances, the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient.
7.14.214	DNA grown in 15N will band at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14N after they had been shifted from 15N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in 15N and
7.14.215	14N.
7.14.216	This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication.
7.14.217	The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15N and 14N, and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA.
7.14.218	These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner.
7.14.219	Therefore, the other two modes were ruled out.
7.14.220	During DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied.
7.14.221	The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand.
7.14.222	When two daughter DNA copies are formed, they have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells.
7.14.223	DNA Replication in Prokaryotes DNA replication has been extremely well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available.
7.14.224	E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome and all of it gets replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle in both directions.
7.14.225	This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second.
7.14.226	The process is quite rapid and occurs without many mistakes.
7.14.227	DNA replication employs a large number of proteins and enzymes, each of which plays a critical role during the process.
7.14.228	One of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol, which adds nucleotides one by one to the growing DNA chain that are complementary to the template strand.
7.14.229	The addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy is obtained from the nucleotides that have three phosphates attached to them, similar to ATP which has three phosphate groups attached.
7.14.230	When the bond between the phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain.
7.14.231	In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known: DNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III.
7.14.232	It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis; DNA pol I and DNA pol II are primarily required for repair.
7.14.233	How does the replication machinery know where to begin?
7.14.234	It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication where replication begins.
7.14.235	In E. coli, which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome (as do most prokaryotes), it is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences.
7.14.236	The origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site.
7.14.237	An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs.
7.14.238	ATP hydrolysis is required for this process.
7.14.239	As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed.
7.14.240	Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds.
7.14.241	Single-strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix.
7.14.242	DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction).
7.14.243	It also requires a free 3'-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3'-OH end and the 5' phosphate of the next nucleotide.
7.14.244	This essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3'-OH group is not available.
7.14.245	Then how does it add the first nucleotide?
7.14.246	The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end.
7.14.247	Another enzyme, RNA primase, synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA.
7.14.248	Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis, it is appropriately called the primer.
7.14.249	DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer, adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand.
7.14.250	A replication fork is formed when helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin of replication.
7.14.251	The DNA tends to become more highly coiled ahead of the replication fork.
7.14.252	Topoisomerase breaks and reforms
7.14.253	DNA’s phosphate backbone ahead of the replication fork, thereby relieving the pressure that results from this supercoiling.
7.14.254	Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA to prevent the helix from re-forming.
7.14.255	Primase synthesizes an RNA primer.
7.14.256	DNA polymerase III uses this primer to synthesize the daughter DNA strand.
7.14.257	On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments.
7.14.258	DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer with DNA.
7.14.259	DNA ligase seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments, joining the fragments into a single DNA molecule.
7.14.260	The replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second.
7.14.261	DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, which poses a slight problem at the replication fork.
7.14.262	As we know, the DNA double helix is anti-parallel; that is, one strand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is oriented in the 3'
7.14.263	to 5' direction.
7.14.264	One strand, which is complementary to the 3' to 5' parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction.
7.14.265	This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand.
7.14.266	The other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA, is extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start the synthesis.
7.14.267	Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them.
7.14.268	The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand.
7.14.269	The leading strand can be extended by one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments.
7.14.270	The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'.
7.14.271	A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides.
7.14.272	The sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place.
7.14.273	Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it.
7.14.274	As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA.
7.14.275	The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides.
7.14.276	The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate end of the other fragment.
7.14.277	Once the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell division.
7.14.278	The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows
7.14.279	: 1.
7.14.280	DNA unwinds at the origin of replication.
7.14.281	2.
7.14.282	Helicase opens up the DNA-forming replication forks; these are extended bidirectionally.
7.14.283	3.
7.14.284	Single-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA.
7.14.285	4.
7.14.286	Topoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling.
7.14.287	5.
7.14.288	Primase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand.
7.14.289	DNA polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer.
7.14.290	7.
7.14.291	Elongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues.
7.14.292	8.
7.14.293	RNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity.
7.14.294	9.
7.14.295	Gaps are filled by DNA pol by adding dNTPs.
7.14.296	10.
7.14.297	The gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase, which helps in the formation of phosphodiester bonds.
7.14.298	DNA Replication in Eukaryotes Eukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes.
7.14.299	The human genome has three billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle.
7.14.300	There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication.
7.14.301	The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second, much slower than prokaryotic replication.
7.14.302	In yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known as Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARS) are found on the chromosomes.
7.14.303	These are equivalent to the origin of replication in E. coli.
7.14.304	The number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have major roles during replication and have been well studied.
7.14.305	They are known as pol α, pol β, pol γ, pol δ, and pol ε.
7.14.306	The essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes.
7.14.307	Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made available as template.
7.14.308	Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes.
7.14.309	The chromatin (the complex between DNA and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the DNA may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery.
7.14.310	At the origin of replication, a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins.
7.14.311	Other proteins are then recruited to start the replication process (Table 14.2).
7.14.312	A helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix.
7.14.313	Replication forks are formed at each replication origin as the DNA unwinds.
7.14.314	The opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or supercoiling, in the DNA ahead of the replication fork.
7.14.315	These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases.
7.14.316	Primers are formed by the enzyme primase, and using the primer, DNA pol can start synthesis.
7.14.317	While the leading strand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol δ, the lagging strand is synthesized by pol ε.
7.14.318	A sliding clamp protein known as PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) holds the DNA pol in place so that it does not slide off the DNA.
7.14.319	RNase H removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced with DNA nucleotides.
7.14.320	The Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand are joined together after the replacement of the RNA primers with DNA.
7.14.321	The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase, which forms the phosphodiester bond.
7.14.322	Telomere replication Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear.
7.14.323	As you’ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction.
7.14.324	In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached.
7.14.325	On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer.
7.14.326	When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome.
7.14.327	These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide.
7.14.328	The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene.
7.14.329	In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide.
7.14.330	In humans, a six base pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times.
7.14.331	The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (Figure 14.16) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained.
7.14.332	The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template.
7.14.333	It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3' end of the DNA strand.
7.14.334	Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes.
7.14.335	Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated.
7.14.336	The ends of linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme.
7.14.337	Telomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells.
7.14.338	It is not active in adult somatic cells.
7.14.339	For her discovery of telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (Figure 14.16) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 2009.
7.14.340	Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel Laureate, is the scientist who discovered how telomerase works.
7.14.341	(credit: US Embassy Sweden)
7.14.342	Telomerase and Aging Cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make telomerase.
7.14.343	This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging.
7.14.344	With the advent of modern medicine, preventative health care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.
7.14.345	In 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice.
7.14.346	This may have potential in regenerative medicine.
7.14.347	[2] Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem cell depletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses.
7.14.348	Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and intestines.
7.14.349	Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.
7.14.350	Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells.
7.14.351	The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate uncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis.
7.14.352	Scientists have observed that cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells.
7.14.353	Interestingly, only after the telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active.
7.14.354	If the action of telomerase in these cells can be inhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division.
7.14.355	DNA Repair DNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a wrong base.
7.14.356	Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer.
7.14.357	Repair mechanisms correct the mistakes.
7.14.358	In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves mutated or defective.
7.14.359	Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added (Figure 14.17).
7.14.360	In proofreading, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so a correction can be made.
7.14.361	The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand.
7.14.362	If it is the right base, the next nucleotide is added.
7.14.363	If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester bond and releases the wrong nucleotide.
7.14.364	This is performed by the exonuclease action of DNA pol III.
7.14.365	Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed, a new one will be added again.
7.14.366	Some errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair is known as mismatch repair (Figure 14.18).
7.14.367	The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it; this is then replaced by the correct base.
7.14.368	If this remains uncorrected, it may lead to more permanent damage.
7.14.369	How do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one?
7.14.370	In E. coli, after replication, the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group; the parental DNA strand will have methyl groups, whereas the newly synthesized strand lacks them.
7.14.371	Thus, DNA polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, nonmethylated strand.
7.14.372	In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has completed.
7.14.373	In mismatch repair, the incorrectly added base is detected after replication.
7.14.374	The mismatch repair proteins detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action.
7.14.375	The gap is now filled with the correctly paired base.
7.14.376	In another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3' and 5' ends of the incorrect base (Figure 14.19).
7.14.377	The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol.
7.14.378	Once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by DNA ligase.
7.14.379	This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers.
7.14.380	Nucleotide excision repairs thymine dimers.
7.14.381	When exposed to UV, thymines lying adjacent to each other can form thymine dimers.
7.14.382	In normal cells, they are excised and replaced.
7.14.383	A well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa (Figure 14.20).
7.14.384	Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun.
7.14.385	When individuals are exposed to UV, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage.
7.14.386	These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal individuals, the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected.
7.14.387	The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix, and this may cause problems during DNA replication.
7.14.388	People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting skin cancer than those who dont have the condition.
7.14.389	Xeroderma pigmentosa is a condition in which thymine dimerization from exposure to UV is not repaired.
7.14.390	Exposure to sunlight results in skin lesions.
7.14.391	(credit: James Halpern et al.)
7.14.392	Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA.
7.14.393	Mutations, variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA.
7.14.394	Such mutations may be of two types: induced or spontaneous.
7.14.395	Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other environmental agent.
7.14.396	Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body.
7.14.397	Mutations may have a wide range of effects.
7.14.398	Some mutations are not expressed; these are known as silent mutations.
7.14.399	Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair.
7.14.400	The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another.
7.14.401	These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions.
7.14.402	Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine.
7.14.403	Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine.
7.14.404	Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion.
7.14.405	Sometimes a piece of DNA from one chromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome; this is also known as translocation.
7.14.406	These mutation types are shown in.
7.14.407	Mutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer.
7.14.408	Many mutated repair genes have been implicated in certain forms of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer.
7.14.409	Mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells.
7.14.410	If many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed in cancer.
7.14.411	If a mutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will be passed on to the next generation, as in the case of hemophilia and xeroderma pigmentosa.  
7.15.0	GENES AND PROTEINS Genes, which are carried on (a) chromosomes, are linearly organized instructions for making the RNA and protein molecules that are necessary for all of processes of life.
7.15.1	The (b) interleukin-2 protein and (c) alpha-2uglobulin protein are just two examples of the array of different molecular structures that are encoded by genes.
7.15.2	Introduction
7.15.3	Since the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in 1900, the definition of the gene has progressed from an abstract unit of heredity to a tangible molecular entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation (Figure 15.1).
7.15.4	Genes are composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on chromosomes.
7.15.5	Genes specify the sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.
7.15.6	In turn, proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell.
7.15.7	Both genes and the proteins they encode are absolutely essential to life as we know it.
7.15.8	The Genetic Code
7.15.9	The cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U).
7.15.10	Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product.
7.15.11	Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters (Figure 15.2).
7.15.12	Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon.
7.15.13	Different amino acids have different chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar) and different structural constraints.
7.15.14	Variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure and function.
7.15.15	Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown.
7.15.16	Each amino acid is composed of an amino group ( NH3 + ), a carboxyl group (COO-), and a side chain (blue).
7.15.17	The side chain may be nonpolar, polar, or charged, as well as large or small.
7.15.18	It is the variety of amino acid side chains that gives rise to the incredible variation of protein structure and function.
7.15.19	The Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes Protein
7.15.20	The flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma (Figure 15.3), which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins.
7.15.21	The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs.
7.15.22	Because the information stored in DNA is so central to cellular function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis, while keeping the DNA itself intact and protected.
7.15.23	The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward, with one nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand.
7.15.24	The translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence.
7.15.25	However, the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.
7.15.26	Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA.
7.15.27	Ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein.
7.15.28	The Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal Given the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” scientists theorized that combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids.
7.15.29	Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (42).
7.15.30	In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets (43), which is far more than the number of amino acids.
7.15.31	Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate.
7.15.32	In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet.
7.15.33	This was later confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus.
7.15.34	When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein synthesis was completely abolished.
7.15.35	When three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional.
7.15.36	This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid.
7.15.37	These nucleotide triplets are called codons.
7.15.38	The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid (Figure 15.5).
7.15.39	Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained.
7.15.40	Scientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the proteins they specified (Figure 15.4).
7.15.41	This figure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet in mRNA into an amino acid or a termination signal in a nascent protein.
7.15.42	(credit: modification of work by NIH)
7.15.43	In addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery.
7.15.44	These triplets are called nonsense codons, or stop codons.
7.15.45	Another codon, AUG, also has a special function.
7.15.46	In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation.
7.15.47	The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the mRNA.
7.15.48	The genetic code is universal.
7.15.49	With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis.
7.15.50	Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin.
7.15.51	That there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on Earth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084 possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64 triplet codons.
7.15.52	The deletion of two nucleotides shifts the reading frame of an mRNA and changes the entire protein message, creating a nonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether.
7.15.53	Degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations.
7.15.54	Codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide.
7.15.55	In addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons.
7.15.56	This nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single-nucleotide substitution mutation might either specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional.
7.15.57	Question: Would a kiwifruit and strawberry that are approximately the same size (Figure 15.6) also have approximately the same amount of DNA?
7.15.58	Background:
7.15.59	Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA.
7.15.60	All mammals are diploid, meaning they have two copies of each chromosome.
7.15.61	However, not all plants are diploid.
7.15.62	The common strawberry is octoploid (8n) and the cultivated kiwi is hexaploid (6n).
7.15.63	Research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and think about how this might correspond to the amount of DNA in these fruits’ cell nuclei.
7.15.64	Read about the technique of DNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate and precipitate DNA.
7.15.65	Hypothesis:
7.15.66	Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly sized strawberries and kiwis.
7.15.67	Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA?
7.15.68	Test your hypothesis: Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized.
7.15.69	Perform the experiment in at least triplicate for each fruit.
7.15.70	1.
7.15.71	Prepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water, 50 mL dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table salt.
7.15.72	Mix by inversion (cap it and turn it upside down a few times).
7.15.73	2.
7.15.74	Grind a strawberry and a kiwifruit by hand in a plastic bag, or using a mortar and pestle, or with a metal bowl and the end of a blunt instrument.
7.15.75	Grind for at least two minutes per fruit.
7.15.76	3.
7.15.77	Add 10 mL of the DNA extraction buffer to each fruit, and mix well for at least one minute.
7.15.78	4.
7.15.79	Remove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a funnel placed in a test tube or an appropriate container.
7.15.80	5.
7.15.81	Pour ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) into the test tube.
7.15.82	You should observe white, precipitated DNA.
7.15.83	6.
7.15.84	Gather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods.
7.15.85	Record your observations: Because you are not quantitatively measuring DNA volume, you can record for each trial whether the two fruits produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye.
7.15.86	If one or the other fruit produced noticeably more DNA, record this as well.
7.15.87	Determine whether your observations are consistent with several pieces of each fruit.
7.15.88	Analyze your data: Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of DNA produced by each fruit?
7.15.89	Were your results reproducible?
7.15.90	Draw a conclusion: Given what you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that chromosome number necessarily correlates to DNA amount?
7.15.91	Can you identify any drawbacks to this procedure?
7.15.92	If you had access to a laboratory, how could you standardize your comparison and make it more quantitative?
7.15.93	Prokaryotic Transcription
7.15.94	The prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membranebound nuclei and other organelles.
7.15.95	A bacterial chromosome is a covalently closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins.
7.15.96	The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid.
7.15.97	In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes.
7.15.98	Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance.
7.15.99	Transcription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis.
7.15.100	The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble.
7.15.101	Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene, which is called the template strand.
7.15.102	The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the nontemplate strand.
7.15.103	The only difference is that in mRNA, all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides.
7.15.104	In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two hydrogen bonds, just as in A–T pairing in a DNA double helix.
7.15.105	The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the +1 site, or the initiation site.
7.15.106	Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream.
7.15.107	Conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “+” numbering and are called downstream nucleotides.
7.15.108	Initiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes Prokaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei.
7.15.109	Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation can all occur simultaneously.
7.15.110	The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple transcription and translation events occurring concurrently on the same DNA template.
7.15.111	Prokaryotic transcription often covers more than one gene and produces polycistronic mRNAs that specify more than one protein.
7.15.112	Our discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in Escherichia coli, a well-studied bacterial species.
7.15.113	Although some differences exist between transcription in E. coli and transcription in archaea, an understanding of E. coli transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.
7.15.114	Prokaryotic RNA Polymerase Prokaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes.
7.15.115	In E. coli, the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits, two of which are identical.
7.15.116	Four of these subunits, denoted α, α, β, and β' comprise the polymerase core enzyme.
7.15.117	These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete.
7.15.118	Each subunit has a unique role; the two α-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the β-subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent “recently born” mRNA molecule; and the β' binds the DNA template strand.
7.15.119	The fifth subunit, σ, is involved only in transcription initiation.
7.15.120	It confers transcriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site.
7.15.121	Without σ, the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish.
7.15.122	The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme.
7.15.123	Prokaryotic Promoters
7.15.124	A promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription.
7.15.125	In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate.
7.15.126	The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently.
7.15.127	Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are conserved.
7.15.128	At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are two promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species (Figure 15.7).
7.15.129	The -10 consensus sequence, called the -10 region, is TATAAT.
7.15.130	The -35 sequence, TTGACA, is recognized and bound by σ.
7.15.131	Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site.
7.15.132	The A–T-rich -10 region facilitates unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made.
7.15.133	The transcription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released.
7.15.134	The σ subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the transcription start sight.
7.15.135	The σ subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has been initiated.
7.15.136	Elongation and Termination in Prokaryotes
7.15.137	The transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the σ subunit from the polymerase.
7.15.138	The dissociation of σ allows the core enzyme to proceed along the DNA template, synthesizing mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of approximately 40 nucleotides per second.
7.15.139	As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it (Figure 15.8).
7.15.140	The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mRNA synthesis components.
7.15.141	Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the nascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.
7.15.142	During elongation, the prokaryotic RNA polymerase tracks along the DNA template, synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, and unwinds and rewinds the DNA as it is read.
7.15.143	Prokaryotic Termination Signals
7.15.144	Once a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA template and liberate the newly made mRNA.
7.15.145	Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals.
7.15.146	One is protein-based and the other is RNA-based.
7.15.147	Rho-dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain.
7.15.148	Near the end of the gene, the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls.
7.15.149	As a result, the rho protein collides with the polymerase.
7.15.150	The interaction with rho releases the mRNA from the transcription bubble.
7.15.151	Rho-independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template strand.
7.15.152	As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed, it encounters a region rich in C–G nucleotides.
7.15.153	The mRNA folds back on itself, and the complementary C–G nucleotides bind together.
7.15.154	The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A–T nucleotides.
7.15.155	The complementary U–A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA.
7.15.156	This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough instability for the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mRNA transcript.
7.15.157	Upon termination, the process of transcription is complete.
7.15.158	By the time termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would already have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur concurrently.
7.15.159	The unification of transcription, translation, and even mRNA degradation is possible because all of these processes occur in the same 5' to 3' direction, and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic cell (Figure 15.9).
7.15.160	In contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation.
7.15.161	Multiple polymerases can transcribe a single bacterial gene while numerous ribosomes concurrently translate the mRNA transcripts into polypeptides.
7.15.162	In this way, a specific protein can rapidly reach a high concentration in the bacterial cell.
7.15.163	Prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few key differences.
7.15.164	The most important difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latter’s membrane-bound nucleus and organelles.
7.15.165	With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must protect its mRNA from degrading before it is translated.
7.15.166	Eukaryotes also employ three different polymerases that each transcribe a different subset of genes.
7.15.167	Eukaryotic mRNAs are usually monogenic, meaning that they specify a single protein.
7.15.168	Initiation of Transcription in Eukaryotes Unlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its own, eukaryotes require several other proteins, called transcription factors, to first bind to the promoter region and then help recruit the appropriate polymerase.
7.15.169	The Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases
7.15.170	The features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex those of prokaryotes.
7.15.171	Instead of a single polymerase comprising five subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of 10 subunits or more.
7.15.172	Each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.
7.15.173	RNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes (Table 15.1).
7.15.174	The rRNA molecules are considered structural RNAs because they have a cellular role but are not translated into protein.
7.15.175	The rRNAs are components of the ribosome and are essential to the process of translation.
7.15.176	RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs except for the 5S rRNA molecule.
7.15.177	The “S” designation applies to “Svedberg” units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a particle sediments during centrifugation.
7.15.178	RNA polymerase II is located in the nucleus and synthesizes all protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs.
7.15.179	Eukaryotic premRNAs undergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation.
7.15.180	For clarity, this module’s discussion of transcription and translation in eukaryotes will use the term “mRNAs” to describe only the mature, processed molecules that are ready to be translated.
7.15.181	RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes.
7.15.182	RNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus.
7.15.183	This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S pre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), and small nuclear pre- RNAs.
7.15.184	The tRNAs have a critical role in translation; they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain.
7.15.185	Small nuclear RNAs have a variety of functions, including “splicing” pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors.
7.15.186	A scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is expressed in the presence of a particular mushroom poison, α-amanitin (Table 15.1).
7.15.187	Interestingly, α-amanitin produced by Amanita phalloides, the Death Cap mushroom, affects the three polymerases very differently.
7.15.188	RNA polymerase I is completely insensitive to α-amanitin, meaning that the polymerase can transcribe DNA in vitro in the presence of this poison.
7.15.189	In contrast, RNA polymerase II is extremely sensitive to α-amanitin, and RNA polymerase III is moderately sensitive.
7.15.190	Knowing the transcribing polymerase can clue a researcher into the general function of the gene being studied.
7.15.191	Because RNA polymerase II transcribes the vast majority of genes, we will focus on this polymerase in our subsequent discussions about eukaryotic transcription factors and promoters.
7.15.192	Structure of an RNA Polymerase II Promoter Eukaryotic promoters are much larger and more complex than prokaryotic promoters, but both have a TATA box.
7.15.193	For example, in the mouse thymidine kinase gene, the TATA box is located at approximately -30 relative to the initiation (+1) site (Figure 15.10).
7.15.194	For this gene, the exact TATA box sequence is TATAAAA, as read in the 5' to 3' direction on the nontemplate strand.
7.15.195	This sequence is not identical to the E. coli TATA box, but it conserves the A–T rich element.
7.15.196	The thermostability of A–T bonds is low and this helps the DNA template to locally unwind in preparation for transcription.
7.15.197	A generalized promoter of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II is shown.
7.15.198	Transcription factors recognize the promoter.
7.15.199	RNA polymerase II then binds and forms the transcription initiation complex.
7.15.200	The mouse genome includes one gene and two pseudogenes for cytoplasmic thymidine kinase.
7.15.201	Pseudogenes are genes that have lost their protein-coding ability or are no longer expressed by the cell.
7.15.202	These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and incorporated into the chromosome.
7.15.203	For example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box (GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80.
7.15.204	This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors.
7.15.205	Further upstream of the TATA box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC-rich boxes (GGCG) or octamer boxes (ATTTGCAT).
7.15.206	These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more “active” genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell.
7.15.207	Transcription Factors for RNA Polymerase II
7.15.208	The complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the polymerases and promoters.
7.15.209	An army of basal transcription factors, enhancers, and silencers also help to regulate the frequency with which pre-mRNA is synthesized from a gene.
7.15.210	Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed.
7.15.211	Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation.
7.15.212	The names of the basal transcription factors begin with “TFII” (this is the transcription factor for RNA polymerase II) and are specified with the letters A–J.
7.15.213	The transcription factors systematically fall into place on the DNA template, with each one further stabilizing the preinitiation complex and contributing to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.
7.15.214	The processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex collections of transcription factors, but the general theme is the same.
7.15.215	Eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each other and with the DNA strand.
7.15.216	Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it ensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs that it needs for protein synthesis.
7.15.217	The Evolution of Promoters
7.15.218	The evolution of genes may be a familiar concept.
7.15.219	Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and the result may or may not be beneficial to the cell.
7.15.220	By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor, the process of mutation can transform functions or physical features.
7.15.221	However, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as well.
7.15.222	For instance, consider a gene that, over many generations, becomes more valuable to the cell.
7.15.223	Maybe the gene encodes a structural protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function.
7.15.224	If this is the case, it would be beneficial to the cell for that gene’s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression.
7.15.225	Scientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results.
7.15.226	In part, this is because it is difficult to infer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends.
7.15.227	Some promoters occur within genes; others are located very far upstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating.
7.15.228	However, when researchers limited their examination to human core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found that promoters evolve even faster than protein-coding genes.
7.15.229	It is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other higher organisms.
7.15.230	However, the evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product is an intriguing alternative to the evolution of the genes themselves.
7.15.231	Promoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III
7.15.232	In eukaryotes, the conserved promoter elements differ for genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I, II, and III.
7.15.233	RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region.
7.15.234	These sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from -180 to -105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation.
7.15.235	Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III have upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.
7.15.236	Eukaryotic Elongation and Termination
7.15.237	Following the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and elongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5'
7.15.238	to 3' direction.
7.15.239	As discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so this section will focus on how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.
7.15.240	Although the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template is more complex.
7.15.241	When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins called chromatin.
7.15.242	The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals.
7.15.243	These DNA–histone histones like thread around a spool.
7.15.244	For polynucleotide synthesis to occur, the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome.
7.15.245	This is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT, which stands for “facilitates chromatin transcription.
7.15.246	”
7.15.247	This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it.
7.15.248	Once the pre-mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.
7.15.249	The termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases.
7.15.250	Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes takes place 1,000–2,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed.
7.15.251	This premRNA tail is subsequently removed by cleavage during mRNA processing.
7.15.252	On the other hand, RNA polymerases I and III require termination signals.
7.15.253	Genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I contain a specific 18-nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a termination protein.
7.15.254	The process of termination in RNA polymerase III involves an mRNA hairpin similar to rho-independent termination of transcription in prokaryotes.
7.15.255	RNA Processing in Eukaryotes
7.15.256	After transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated.
7.15.257	Eukaryotic (and prokaryotic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein synthesis machinery.
7.15.258	mRNA Processing The eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated.
7.15.259	The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation create a molecule with a much longer half-life than a prokaryotic mRNA.
7.15.260	Eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical E. coli mRNA lasts no more than five seconds.
7.15.261	Pre-mRNAs are first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins; these protect the pre-mRNA from degradation while it is processed and exported out of the nucleus.
7.15.262	The three most important steps of pre-mRNA processing are the addition of stabilizing and signaling factors at the 5' and 3' ends of the molecule, and the removal of intervening sequences that do not specify the appropriate amino acids.
7.15.263	In rare cases, the mRNA transcript can be “edited” after it is transcribed.
7.15.264	RNA Editing in Trypanosomes
7.15.265	The trypanosomes are a group of protozoa that include the pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness in humans (Figure 15.12).
7.15.266	Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have organelles called mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy.
7.15.267	Mitochondria are organelles that express their own DNA and are believed to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed prokaryote.
7.15.268	The mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to The Central Dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have the correct information to specify a functional protein.
7.15.269	Usually, this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides.
7.15.270	The cell performs an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this.
7.15.271	Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans.
7.15.272	The mRNAs of this pathogen must be modified by the addition of nucleotides before protein synthesis can occur.
7.15.273	(credit: modification of work by Torsten Ochsenreiter)
7.15.274	Other genes in the mitochondrial genome encode
7.15.275	40- to 80-nucleotide guide RNAs.
7.15.276	One or more of these molecules interacts by complementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA transcript.
7.15.277	However, the guide RNA has more A nucleotides than the pre-mRNA has U nucleotides to bind with.
7.15.278	In these regions, the guide RNA loops out.
7.15.279	The 3' ends of guide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and these U bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide RNAs are looped.
7.15.280	This process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules.
7.15.281	That is, guide RNAs—rather than proteins—serve as the catalysts in RNA editing.
7.15.282	RNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes.
7.15.283	In the mitochondria of some plants, almost all pre-mRNAs are edited.
7.15.284	RNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even humans.
7.15.285	What could be the evolutionary reason for this additional step in pre-mRNA processing?
7.15.286	One possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient prokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNAbased method for regulating gene expression.
7.15.287	In support of this hypothesis, edits made to pre-mRNAs differ depending on cellular conditions.
7.15.288	Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a holdover from a primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.
7.15.289	5' Capping
7.15.290	While the pre-mRNA is still being synthesized, a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the growing transcript by a phosphate linkage.
7.15.291	This moiety (functional group) protects the nascent mRNA from degradation.
7.15.292	In addition, factors involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.
7.15.293	3' Poly-A Tail
7.15.294	Once elongation is complete, the pre-mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU-rich sequence, leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre-mRNA.
7.15.295	An enzyme called poly-A polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 A residues, called the poly-A tail.
7.15.296	This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm.
7.15.297	Pre-mRNA Splicing Eukaryotic genes are composed of exons, which correspond to protein-coding sequences (ex-on signifies that they are expressed), and intervening sequences called introns (int-ron denotes their intervening role), which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing.
7.15.298	Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins.
7.15.299	The discovery of introns came as a surprise to researchers in the 1970s who expected that pre-mRNAs would specify protein sequences without further processing, as they had observed in prokaryotes.
7.15.300	The genes of higher eukaryotes very often contain one or more introns.
7.15.301	These regions may correspond to regulatory sequences; however, the biological significance of having many introns or having very long introns in a gene is unclear.
7.15.302	It is possible that introns slow down gene expression because it takes longer to transcribe pre-mRNAs with lots of introns.
7.15.303	Alternatively, introns may be nonfunctional sequence remnants left over from the fusion of ancient genes throughout evolution.
7.15.304	This is supported by the fact that separate exons often encode separate protein subunits or domains.
7.15.305	For the most part, the sequences of introns can be mutated without ultimately affecting the protein product.
7.15.306	All of a pre-mRNA’s introns must be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis.
7.15.307	If the process errs by even a single nucleotide, the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift, and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional.
7.15.308	The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing (Figure 15.13).
7.15.309	Introns are removed and degraded while the pre-mRNA is still in the nucleus.
7.15.310	Splicing occurs by a sequence-specific mechanism that ensures introns will be removed and exons rejoined with the accuracy and precision of a single nucleotide.
7.15.311	The splicing of pre-mRNAs is conducted by complexes of proteins and RNA molecules called spliceosomes.
7.15.312	Pre-mRNA splicing involves the precise removal of introns from the primary RNA transcript.
7.15.313	The splicing process is catalyzed by protein complexes called spliceosomes that are composed of proteins and RNA molecules called snRNAs.
7.15.314	Spliceosomes recognize sequences at the 5' and 3' end of the intron.
7.15.315	Errors in splicing are implicated in cancers and other human diseases.
7.15.316	What kinds of mutations might lead to splicing errors?
7.15.317	Think of different possible outcomes if splicing errors occur.
7.15.318	Note that more than 70 individual introns can be present, and each has to undergo the process of splicing—in addition to 5' capping and the addition of a poly-A tail—just to generate a single, translatable mRNA molecule.
7.15.319	Processing of tRNAs and rRNAs
7.15.320	The tRNAs and rRNAs are structural molecules that have roles in protein synthesis; however, these RNAs are not themselves translated.
7.15.321	Pre-rRNAs are transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus.
7.15.322	Pre-tRNAs are transcribed and processed in the nucleus and then released into the cytoplasm where they are linked to free amino acids for protein synthesis.
7.15.323	Most of the tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first transcribed as a long precursor molecule that spans multiple rRNAs or tRNAs.
7.15.324	Enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits corresponding to each structural RNA.
7.15.325	Some of the bases of pre-rRNAs are methylated; that is, a –CH3 moiety (methyl functional group) is added for stability.
7.15.326	PretRNA molecules also undergo methylation.
7.15.327	As with pre-mRNAs, subunit excision occurs in eukaryotic pre-RNAs destined to become tRNAs or rRNAs.
7.15.328	Mature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome.
7.15.329	Some of a ribosome’s RNA molecules are purely structural, whereas others have catalytic or binding activities.
7.15.330	Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end (Figure 15.14).
7.15.331	The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon through complementary base pairing.
7.15.332	This is a space-filling model of a tRNA molecule that adds the amino acid phenylalanine to a growing polypeptide chain.
7.15.333	The anticodon AAG binds the Codon UUC on the mRNA.
7.15.334	The amino acid phenylalanine is attached to the other end of the tRNA.
7.15.335	The synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell’s energy than any other metabolic process.
7.15.336	In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell.
7.15.337	The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product.
7.15.338	Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000.
7.15.339	Each individual amino acid has an amino group (NH2) and a carboxyl (COOH) group.
7.15.340	Polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid (Figure 15.15).
7.15.341	This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule.
7.15.342	A peptide bond links the carboxyl end of one amino acid with the amino end of another, expelling one water molecule.
7.15.343	For simplicity in this image, only the functional groups involved in the peptide bond are shown.
7.15.344	The R and R' designations refer to the rest of each amino acid structure.
7.15.345	The Protein Synthesis Machinery
7.15.346	In addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation.
7.15.347	The composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of rRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism.
7.15.348	However, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells.
7.15.349	Translation requires the input of an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors.
7.15.350	Ribosomes Even before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes.
7.15.351	In E. coli, there are between 10,000 and 70,000 ribosomes present in each cell at any given time.
7.15.352	A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides.
7.15.353	In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.
7.15.354	Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes.
7.15.355	Mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm.
7.15.356	Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation.
7.15.357	In E. coli, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of 70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive).
7.15.358	Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit, for a total of 80S.
7.15.359	The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds tRNAs.
7.15.360	Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction: reading the mRNA from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus.
7.15.361	The complete mRNA/poly-ribosome structure is called a polysome.
7.15.362	tRNAs
7.15.363	The tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes by RNA polymerase III.
7.15.364	Depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of tRNAs exist in the cytoplasm.
7.15.365	Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to sequences on the mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain.
7.15.366	Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually “translate” the language of RNA into the language of proteins.
7.15.367	Of the 64 possible mRNA codons—or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and C—three specify the termination of protein synthesis and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain.
7.15.368	Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes the initiation of translation.
7.15.369	Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one of the mRNA codons and add an amino acid or terminate translation, according to the genetic code.
7.15.370	For instance, if the sequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a tRNA expressing the complementary sequence, GAU, which would be linked to the amino acid leucine.
7.15.371	As the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package.
7.15.372	Consider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors: 1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase (see below); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.
7.15.373	Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases
7.15.374	The process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule.
7.15.375	The corresponding amino acid must be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm.
7.15.376	Through the process of tRNA “charging,” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.
7.15.377	At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species.
7.15.378	These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a high-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction.
7.15.379	The activated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released.
7.15.380	The Mechanism of Protein Synthesis
7.15.381	As with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination.
7.15.382	The process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
7.15.383	Here we’ll explore how translation occurs in E. coli, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.
7.15.384	Initiation of Translation Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex.
7.15.385	In E. coli, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special initiator tRNA, called tRNAf Met .
7.15.386	The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG (or rarely, GUG), links to a formylated methionine called fMet, and can also bind IF-2.
7.15.387	Formylated methionine is inserted by
7.15.388	fMet − tRNAf Met at the beginning of every polypeptide chain synthesized by E. coli,
7.15.389	but it is usually clipped off after translation is complete.
7.15.390	When an in-frame AUG is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNAMet.
7.15.391	In E. coli mRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome.
7.15.392	This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template.
7.15.393	Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during translation—both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome’s translocation.
7.15.394	In eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, IFs, and nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP).
7.15.395	The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNAi, does not bind fMet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.
7.15.396	Instead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mRNA.
7.15.397	A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap.
7.15.398	Once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the AUG start codon.
7.15.399	Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case.
7.15.400	According to Kozak’s rules, the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon.
7.15.401	Kozak’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'.
7.15.402	The R (for purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but cannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation.
7.15.403	Once the appropriate AUG is identified, the other proteins and CBP dissociate, and the 60S subunit binds to the complex of Met-tRNAi, mRNA, and the 40S subunit.
7.15.404	This step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes.
7.15.405	Translation, Elongation, and Termination
7.15.406	In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of E. coli.
7.15.407	The 50S ribosomal subunit of E. coli consists of three compartments: the A (aminoacyl) site binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs.
7.15.408	The P (peptidyl) site binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA.
7.15.409	The E (exit) site releases dissociated tRNAs so that they can be recharged with free amino acids.
7.15.410	There is one exception to this assembly line of tRNAs: in E. coli,
7.15.411	fMet − tRNAf
7.15.412	Met is capable of entering the P site directly without first entering the A site.
7.15.413	Similarly, the eukaryotic Met-tRNAi, with help from other proteins of the initiation complex, binds directly to the P site.
7.15.414	In both cases, this creates an initiation complex with a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the first codon after the AUG.
7.15.415	During translation elongation, the mRNA template provides specificity.
7.15.416	As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, each mRNA codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged tRNA anticodon is ensured.
7.15.417	If mRNA were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind tRNAs nonspecifically.
7.15.418	Elongation proceeds with charged tRNAs entering the A site and then shifting to the P site followed by the E site with each single-codon “step” of the ribosome.
7.15.419	Ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3' direction.
7.15.420	The energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes GTP.
7.15.421	Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA.
7.15.422	The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit.
7.15.423	The energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor.
7.15.424	The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain.
7.15.425	As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled (Figure 15.16).
7.15.426	Amazingly, the E. coli translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.
7.15.427	Translation begins when an initiator tRNA anticodon recognizes a codon on mRNA.
7.15.428	The large ribosomal subunit joins the small subunit, and a second tRNA is recruited.
7.15.429	As the mRNA moves relative to the ribosome, the polypeptide chain is formed.
7.15.430	Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates translation and the components dissociate.
7.15.431	Many antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis.
7.15.432	For example, tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial ribosome, and chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer.
7.15.433	What specific effect would you expect each of these antibiotics to have on protein synthesis?
7.15.434	Termination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered.
7.15.435	Upon aligning with the A site, these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that instruct peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the P-site amino acid.
7.15.436	This reaction forces the P-site amino acid to detach from its tRNA, and the newly made protein is released.
7.15.437	The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex.
7.15.438	After many ribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription reaction.
7.15.439	Protein Folding, Modification, and Targeting During and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended, and the new protein “folds” into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions.
7.15.440	A signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment.
7.15.441	These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein’s “train ticket” to its ultimate destination.
7.15.442	Other cellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment.
7.15.443	For instance, a specific sequence at the amino terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants).
7.15.444	Once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off.
7.15.445	Many proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from aggregating during the complicated process of folding.
7.15.446	Even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mRNA, it could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or pH conditions prevent it from folding correctly.
7.16.0	GENE EXPRESSION
7.16.1	The genetic content of each somatic cell in an organism is the same, but not all genes are expressed in every cell.
7.16.2	The control of which genes are expressed dictates whether a cell is (a) an eye cell or (b) a liver cell.
7.16.3	It is the differential gene expression patterns that arise in different cells that give rise to (c) a complete organism.
7.16.4	Introduction
7.16.5	Each somatic cell in the body generally contains the same DNA.
7.16.6	A few exceptions include red blood cells, which contain no DNA in their mature state, and some immune system cells that rearrange their DNA while producing antibodies.
7.16.7	In general, however, the genes that determine whether you have green eyes, brown hair, and how fast you metabolize food are the same in the cells in your eyes and your liver, even though these organs function quite differently.
7.16.8	If each cell has the same DNA, how is it that cells or organs are different?
7.16.9	Why do cells in the eye differ so dramatically from cells in the liver?
7.16.10	Whereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes.
7.16.11	Each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function.
7.16.12	Therefore, only a small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell.
7.16.13	For the proteins to be expressed, the DNA must be transcribed into RNA and the RNA must be translated into protein.
7.16.14	In a given cell type, not all genes encoded in the DNA are transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our body have specific functions.
7.16.15	Specialized proteins that make up the eye (iris, lens, and cornea) are only expressed in the eye, whereas the specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and valves) are only expressed in the heart.
7.16.16	At any given time, only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our DNA are expressed and translated into proteins.
7.16.17	The expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels and stages of control.
7.16.18	This complexity ensures the proper expression in the proper cell at the proper time.
7.16.19	Regulation of Gene Expression For a cell to function properly, necessary proteins must be synthesized at the proper time.
7.16.20	All cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA.
7.16.21	The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression.
7.16.22	Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed.
7.16.23	For this to occur, there must be a mechanism to control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no longer needed.
7.16.24	The regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space.
7.16.25	It would require a significant amount of energy for an organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only when they are required.
7.16.26	In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because DNA must be unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA.
7.16.27	Cells would have to be enormous if every protein were expressed in every cell all the time.
7.16.28	The control of gene expression is extremely complex.
7.16.29	Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell and can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer.
7.16.30	Prokaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression
7.16.31	To understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional protein in a cell.
7.16.32	The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different manners.
7.16.33	Prokaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats freely in the cell cytoplasm.
7.16.34	To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost simultaneously.
7.16.35	When the resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops.
7.16.36	As a result, the primary method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is the regulation of DNA transcription.
7.16.37	All of the subsequent steps occur automatically.
7.16.38	When more protein is required, more transcription occurs.
7.16.39	Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression is mostly at the transcriptional level.
7.16.40	Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity.
7.16.41	In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is contained inside the cell’s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA.
7.16.42	The newly synthesized RNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into protein.
7.16.43	The processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm.
7.16.44	The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (Figure 16.2).
7.16.45	Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors ( epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed ( post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational level), or after the protein has been made ( post-translational level).
7.16.46	Prokaryotic transcription and translation occur simultaneously in the cytoplasm, and regulation occurs at the transcriptional level.
7.16.47	Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated during transcription and RNA processing, which take place in the nucleus, and during protein translation, which takes place in the cytoplasm.
7.16.48	Further regulation may occur through post-translational modifications of proteins.
7.16.49	The differences in the regulation of gene expression between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are summarized in Table 16.1.
7.16.50	The regulation of gene expression is discussed in detail in subsequent modules.
7.16.51	Evolution of Gene Regulation Prokaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the amount of transcription.
7.16.52	As eukaryotic cells evolved, the complexity of the control of gene expression increased.
7.16.53	For example, with the evolution of eukaryotic cells came compartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes.
7.16.54	A nuclear region that contains the DNA was formed.
7.16.55	Transcription and translation were physically separated into two different cellular compartments.
7.16.56	It therefore became possible to control gene expression by regulating transcription in the nucleus, and also by controlling the RNA levels and protein translation present outside the nucleus.
7.16.57	Some cellular processes arose from the need of the organism to defend itself.
7.16.58	Cellular processes such as gene silencing developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections.
7.16.59	If the cell could quickly shut off gene expression for a short period of time, it would be able to survive an infection when other organisms could not.
7.16.60	Therefore, the organism evolved a new process that helped it survive, and it was able to pass this new development to offspring.
7.16.61	Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
7.16.62	The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm.
7.16.63	Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called operons.
7.16.64	For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or lac) operon.
7.16.65	In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers.
7.16.66	Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus.
7.16.67	Finally, inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.
7.16.68	The trp Operon: A Repressor Operon Bacteria such as E. coli need amino acids to survive.
7.16.69	Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E. coli can ingest from the environment.
7.16.70	E. coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes.
7.16.71	These five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan (trp) operon (Figure 16.3).
7.16.72	If tryptophan is present in the environment, then E. coli does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation of the genes in the trp operon is switched off.
7.16.73	However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, transcription is initiated, the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized.
7.16.74	The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan in E. coli are located next to each other in the trp operon.
7.16.75	When tryptophan is plentiful, two tryptophan molecules bind the repressor protein at the operator sequence.
7.16.76	This physically blocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the tryptophan genes.
7.16.77	When tryptophan is absent, the repressor protein does not bind to the operator and the genes are transcribed.
7.16.78	A DNA sequence that codes for proteins is referred to as the coding region.
7.16.79	The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon.
7.16.80	Just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site.
7.16.81	This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.
7.16.82	The promoter sequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a sequence within or near the promoter to which proteins (activators or repressors) can bind and regulate transcription.
7.16.83	A DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene.
7.16.84	This operator contains the DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind.
7.16.85	When tryptophan is present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor, which changes shape to bind to the trp operator.
7.16.86	Binding of the tryptophan–repressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding, and transcribing the downstream genes.
7.16.87	When tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator; therefore, the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized.
7.16.88	Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off, the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators.
7.16.89	Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): An Activator Regulator
7.16.90	Just as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them.
7.16.91	For example, when glucose is scarce, E. coli bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel.
7.16.92	To do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed.
7.16.93	When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell.
7.16.94	The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in E. coli.
7.16.95	When glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein (CAP), a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars.
7.16.96	When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (Figure 16.4).
7.16.97	In these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter.
7.16.98	This increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the transcription of the genes.
7.16.99	When glucose levels fall, E. coli may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so.
7.16.100	As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase.
7.16.101	This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator that binds to an operator region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.
7.16.102	The lac Operon: An Inducer Operon
7.16.103	The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell.
7.16.104	The lac operon is a typical inducible operon.
7.16.105	As mentioned previously, E. coli is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low.
7.16.106	To do so, the cAMP–CAP protein complex serves as a positive regulator to induce transcription.
7.16.107	One such sugar source is lactose.
7.16.108	The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment.
7.16.109	CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon.
7.16.110	However, for the lac operon to be activated, two conditions must be met.
7.16.111	First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent.
7.16.112	Second, lactose must be present.
7.16.113	Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the lac operon be transcribed (Figure 16.5).
7.16.114	This makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available.
7.16.115	Transcription of the lac operon is carefully regulated so that its expression only occurs when glucose is limited and lactose is present to serve as an alternative fuel source.
7.16.116	If glucose is absent, then CAP can bind to the operator sequence to activate transcription.
7.16.117	If lactose is absent, then the repressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription.
7.16.118	If either of these requirements is met, then transcription remains off.
7.16.119	Only when both conditions are satisfied is the lac operon transcribed.
7.16.120	Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation Eukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression because the processes of transcription and translation are physically separated.
7.16.121	Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells can regulate gene expression at many different levels.
7.16.122	Eukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the DNA.
7.16.123	This form of regulation, called epigenetic regulation, occurs even before transcription is initiated.
7.16.124	Epigenetic Control: Regulating Access to Genes within the Chromosome
7.16.125	The human genome encodes over 20,000 genes; each of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes encodes thousands of genes.
7.16.126	The DNA in the nucleus is precisely wound, folded, and compacted into chromosomes so that it will fit into the nucleus.
7.16.127	It is also organized so that specific segments can be accessed as needed by a specific cell type.
7.16.128	The first level of organization, or packing, is the winding of DNA strands around histone proteins.
7.16.129	Histones package and order DNA into structural units called nucleosome complexes, which can control the access of proteins to the DNA regions (Figure 16.6a).
7.16.130	Under the electron microscope, this winding of DNA around histone proteins to form nucleosomes looks like small beads on a string (Figure 16.6b).
7.16.131	These beads (histone proteins) can move along the string (DNA) and change the structure of the molecule.
7.16.132	DNA is folded around histone proteins to create (a) nucleosome complexes.
7.16.133	These nucleosomes control the access of proteins to the underlying DNA.
7.16.134	When viewed through an electron microscope (b), the nucleosomes look like beads on a string.
7.16.135	(credit “micrograph
7.16.136	”:
7.16.137	modification of work by Chris Woodcock)
7.16.138	If DNA encoding a specific gene is to be transcribed into RNA, the nucleosomes surrounding
7.16.139	that region of DNA can slide down the DNA to open that specific chromosomal region and allow for the transcriptional machinery (RNA polymerase) to initiate transcription (Figure 16.7).
7.16.140	Nucleosomes can move to open the chromosome structure to expose a segment of DNA, but do so in a very controlled manner.
7.16.141	Nucleosomes can slide along DNA.
7.16.142	When nucleosomes are spaced closely together (top), transcription factors cannot bind and gene expression is turned off.
7.16.143	When the nucleosomes are spaced far apart (bottom), the DNA is exposed.
7.16.144	Transcription factors can bind, allowing gene expression to occur.
7.16.145	Modifications to the histones and DNA affect nucleosome spacing.
7.16.146	In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated during embryonic development because of epigenetic changes to the chromatin.
7.16.147	What impact do you think these changes would have on nucleosome packing?
7.16.148	How the histone proteins move is dependent on signals found on both the histone proteins and on the DNA.
7.16.149	These signals are tags added to histone proteins and DNA that tell the histones if a chromosomal region should be open or closed (Figure 16.8 depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA).
7.16.150	These tags are not permanent, but may be added or removed as needed.
7.16.151	They are chemical modifications (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) that are attached to specific amino acids in the protein or to the nucleotides of the DNA.
7.16.152	The tags do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter how tightly wound the DNA is around the histone proteins.
7.16.153	DNA is a negatively charged molecule; therefore, changes in the charge of the histone will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be.
7.16.154	When unmodified, the histone proteins have a large positive charge; by adding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive.
7.16.155	The DNA molecule itself can also be modified.
7.16.156	This occurs within very specific regions called CpG islands.
7.16.157	These are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter regions of genes.
7.16.158	When this configuration exists, the cytosine member of the pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added).
7.16.159	This modification changes how the DNA interacts with proteins, including the histone proteins that control access to the region.
7.16.160	Highly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive.
7.16.161	Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified chemically.
7.16.162	Modifications affect nucleosome spacing and gene expression.
7.16.163	(credit: modification of work by NIH)
7.16.164	This type of gene regulation is called epigenetic regulation.
7.16.165	Epigenetic means “around genetics.
7.16.166	”
7.16.167	The changes that occur to the histone proteins and DNA do not alter the nucleotide sequence and are not permanent.
7.16.168	Instead, these changes are temporary (although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division) and alter the chromosomal structure (open or closed) as needed.
7.16.169	A gene can be turned on or off depending upon the location and modifications to the histone proteins and DNA.
7.16.170	If a gene is to be transcribed, the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene.
7.16.171	This opens the chromosomal region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins, called transcription factors, to bind to the promoter region, located just upstream of the gene, and initiate transcription.
7.16.172	If a gene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration.
7.16.173	In this closed configuration, the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to the DNA and transcription cannot occur (Figure 16.7).
7.16.174	Eukaryotic Transcription Gene Regulation Like prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a sequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription.
7.16.175	However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation.
7.16.176	Transcription factors are proteins that bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene.
7.16.177	RNA polymerase by itself cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells.
7.16.178	Transcription factors must bind to the promoter region first and recruit RNA polymerase to the site for transcription to be established.
7.16.179	The Promoter and the Transcription Machinery Genes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier.
7.16.180	The promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding sequence.
7.16.181	This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long).
7.16.182	The longer the promoter, the more available space for proteins to bind.
7.16.183	This also adds more control to the transcription process.
7.16.184	The length of the promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes.
7.16.185	Consequently, the level of control of gene expression can also differ quite dramatically between genes.
7.16.186	The purpose of the promoter is to bind transcription factors that control the initiation of transcription.
7.16.187	Within the promoter region, just upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box.
7.16.188	This box is simply a repeat of thymine and adenine dinucleotides (literally, TATA repeats).
7.16.189	RNA polymerase binds to the transcription initiation complex, allowing transcription to occur.
7.16.190	To initiate transcription, a transcription factor (TFIID) is the first to bind to the TATA box.
7.16.191	Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH to the TATA box.
7.16.192	Once this complex is assembled, RNA polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence.
7.16.193	When bound along with the transcription factors, RNA polymerase is phosphorylated.
7.16.194	This releases part of the protein from the DNA to activate the transcription initiation complex and places RNA polymerase in the correct orientation to begin transcription; DNA-bending protein brings the enhancer, which can be quite a distance from the gene, in contact with transcription factors and mediator proteins (Figure 16.9).
7.16.195	An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription.
7.16.196	Each enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements.
7.16.197	Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins and transcription factors.
7.16.198	Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements, enabling differential gene expression.
7.16.199	In addition to the general transcription factors, other transcription factors can bind to the promoter to regulate gene transcription.
7.16.200	These transcription factors bind to the promoters of a specific set of genes.
7.16.201	They are not general transcription factors that bind to every promoter complex, but are recruited to a specific sequence on the promoter of a specific gene.
7.16.202	There are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif.
7.16.203	When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a cis-acting element, because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene.
7.16.204	The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site.
7.16.205	Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.
7.16.206	Enhancers and Transcription
7.16.207	In some eukaryotic genes, there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription.
7.16.208	These regions, called enhancers, are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance.
7.16.209	They can be located upstream of a gene, within the coding region of the gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away.
7.16.210	Enhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for transcription factors.
7.16.211	When a DNA-bending protein binds, the shape of the DNA changes (Figure 16.9).
7.16.212	This shape change allows for the interaction of the activators bound to the enhancers with the transcription factors bound to the promoter region and the RNA polymerase.
7.16.213	Whereas DNA is generally depicted as a straight line in two dimensions, it is actually a three-dimensional object.
7.16.214	Therefore, a nucleotide sequence thousands of nucleotides away can fold over and interact with a specific promoter.
7.16.215	Turning Genes
7.16.216	Off:
7.16.217	Transcriptional Repressors
7.16.218	Like prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription.
7.16.219	Transcriptional repressors can bind to promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription.
7.16.220	Like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external stimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors.
7.16.221	Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation RNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin.
7.16.222	This processing after an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification.
7.16.223	As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene expression in the cell.
7.16.224	If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized.
7.16.225	RNA splicing, the first stage of post-transcriptional control In eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcript often contains regions, called introns, that are removed prior to translation.
7.16.226	The regions of RNA that code for protein are called exons (Figure 16.10).
7.16.227	After an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but prior to its departure from the nucleus to be translated, the RNA is processed and the introns are removed by splicing.
7.16.228	Alternative RNA Splicing
7.16.229	In the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing.
7.16.230	Alternative RNA splicing is a mechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations of introns, and sometimes exons, are removed from the transcript (Figure 16.11).
7.16.231	This alternative splicing can be haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein products in different cells or at different stages of development.
7.16.232	Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.
7.16.233	How could alternative splicing evolve?
7.16.234	Introns have a beginning and ending recognition sequence; it is easy to imagine the failure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and instead find the end of the next intron, thus removing two introns and the intervening exon.
7.16.235	In fact, there are mechanisms in place to prevent such intron skipping, but mutations are likely to lead to their failure.
7.16.236	Such “mistakes” would more than likely produce a nonfunctional protein.
7.16.237	Indeed, the cause of many genetic diseases is alternative splicing rather than mutations in a sequence.
7.16.238	However, alternative splicing would create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein, opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new variant to new functions.
7.16.239	Gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way by providing genes that may evolve without eliminating the original, functional protein.
7.16.240	Control of RNA Stability
7.16.241	Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective "caps" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey.
7.16.242	The 5' cap, which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (GTP).
7.16.243	The poly-A tail, which is attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides.
7.16.244	Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled.
7.16.245	Each RNA molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate.
7.16.246	This rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell.
7.16.247	If the decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time for translation to occur.
7.16.248	Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the RNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more protein can be translated.
7.16.249	This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability.
7.16.250	If the RNA is stable, it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm.
7.16.251	Binding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability.
7.16.252	Proteins, called RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region.
7.16.253	These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions, or UTRs.
7.16.254	They are not introns (those have been removed in the nucleus).
7.16.255	Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation.
7.16.256	The region just before the protein-coding region is called the 5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3' UTR (Figure 16.12).
7.16.257	The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the specific RBP that binds.
7.16.258	The protein-coding region of mRNA is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs).
7.16.259	The presence of RNA-binding proteins at the 5' or 3' UTR influences the stability of the RNA molecule.
7.16.260	RNA Stability and microRNAs
7.16.261	In addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA stability, other elements called microRNAs can bind to the RNA molecule.
7.16.262	These microRNAs, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21–24 nucleotides in length.
7.16.263	The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre-miRNAs.
7.16.264	These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer.
7.16.265	Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA; however, miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
7.16.266	RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA.
7.16.267	Together, miRNAs and the RISC complex rapidly destroy the RNA molecule.
7.16.268	Eukaryotic Translational and Post-translational Gene Regulation
7.16.269	After the RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into protein.
7.16.270	Control of this process is largely dependent on the RNA molecule.
7.16.271	As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on its translation into a protein.
7.16.272	As the stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.
7.16.273	The Initiation Complex and Translation Rate Like transcription, translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process.
7.16.274	In translation, the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex.
7.16.275	The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2).
7.16.276	The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high-energy molecule guanosine triphosphate (GTP).
7.16.277	GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate (GDP).
7.16.278	The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit.
7.16.279	When bound, the methionine initiator tRNA associates with the eIF-2/40S ribosome complex, bringing along with it the mRNA to be translated.
7.16.280	At this point, when the initiator complex is assembled, the GTP is converted into GDP and energy is released.
7.16.281	The phosphate and the eIF-2 protein are released from the complex and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds to translate the RNA.
7.16.282	The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation.
7.16.283	If eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it undergoes a conformational change and cannot bind to GTP.
7.16.284	Therefore, the initiation complex cannot form properly and translation is impeded (Figure 16.13).
7.16.285	When eIF-2 remains unphosphorylated, it binds the RNA and actively translates the protein.
7.16.286	Chemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity Proteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups.
7.16.287	The addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell.
7.16.288	Sometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell—for example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or attached to the plasma membrane.
7.16.289	Chemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light exposure.
7.16.290	These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation—all resulting in changes in expression of various genes.
7.16.291	This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in response to the environment.
7.16.292	Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein (depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation (by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can modify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications).
7.16.293	The addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation.
7.16.294	Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete.
7.16.295	These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be degraded (Figure 16.14).
7.16.296	One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein.
7.16.297	Cancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases.
7.16.298	In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells don’t stop growing as they normally would.
7.16.299	Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle.
7.16.300	One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.
7.16.301	For cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints.
7.16.302	This ensures that the cell has properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function.
7.16.303	Many proteins, including cyclin B, control these checkpoints.
7.16.304	The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function.
7.16.305	As a result, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated.
7.16.306	This post-translational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the development of cancer.
7.16.307	Cancer: Disease of Altered Gene Expression Cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression.
7.16.308	There are many proteins that are turned on or off (gene activation or gene silencing) that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell.
7.16.309	A gene that is not normally expressed in that cell can be switched on and expressed at high levels.
7.16.310	This can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene regulation (epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-translation).
7.16.311	Changes in epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA stability, protein translation, and post-translational control can be detected in cancer.
7.16.312	While these changes don’t occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals.
7.16.313	Therefore, changes in histone acetylation (epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation, increased RNA stability, increased translational control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells.
7.16.314	Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell.
7.16.315	Tumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Cancer
7.16.316	In normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell growth.
7.16.317	These are tumor suppressor genes, which are active in normal cells to prevent uncontrolled cell growth.
7.16.318	There are many tumor suppressor genes in cells.
7.16.319	The most studied tumor suppressor gene is p53, which is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types.
7.16.320	The p53 protein itself functions as a transcription factor.
7.16.321	It can bind to sites in the promoters of genes to initiate transcription.
7.16.322	Therefore, the mutation of p53 in cancer will dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of its target genes.
7.16.323	Proto-oncogenes are positive cell-cycle regulators.
7.16.324	When mutated, proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes and cause cancer.
7.16.325	Overexpression of the oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.
7.16.326	This is because oncogenes can alter transcriptional activity, stability, or protein translation of another gene that directly or indirectly controls cell growth.
7.16.327	An example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc.
7.16.328	Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett’s Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system.
7.16.329	Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably.
7.16.330	High B-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function.
7.16.331	Patients with Burkett’s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability to eat.
7.16.332	Cancer and Epigenetic Alterations Silencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells.
7.16.333	There are characteristic modifications to histone proteins and DNA that are associated with silenced genes.
7.16.334	In cancer cells, the DNA in the promoter region of silenced genes is methylated on cytosine DNA residues in CpG islands.
7.16.335	Histone proteins that surround that region lack the acetylation modification that is present when the genes are expressed in normal cells.
7.16.336	This combination of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation (epigenetic modifications that lead to gene silencing) is commonly found in cancer.
7.16.337	When these modifications occur, the gene present in that chromosomal region is silenced.
7.16.338	Increasingly, scientists understand how epigenetic changes are altered in cancer.
7.16.339	Because these changes are temporary and can be reversed—for example, by preventing the action of the histone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups, or by DNA methyl transferase enzymes that add methyl groups to cytosines in
7.16.340	DNA—
7.16.341	it is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take advantage of the reversible nature of these processes.
7.16.342	Indeed, many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a cancer cell to help re-establish normal growth patterns.
7.16.343	Genes involved in the development of many other illnesses, ranging from allergies to inflammation to autism, are thought to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms.
7.16.344	As our knowledge of how genes are controlled deepens, new ways to treat diseases like cancer will emerge.
7.16.345	Cancer and Transcriptional Control Alterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional control of gene expression.
7.16.346	Mutations that activate transcription factors, such as increased phosphorylation, can increase the binding of a transcription factor to its binding site in a promoter.
7.16.347	This could lead to increased transcriptional activation of that gene that results in modified cell growth.
7.16.348	Alternatively, a mutation in the DNA of a promoter or enhancer region can increase the binding ability of a transcription factor.
7.16.349	This could also lead to the increased transcription and aberrant gene expression that is seen in cancer cells.
7.16.350	Researchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional activation of gene expression in cancer.
7.16.351	Identifying how a transcription factor binds, or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off, has led to new drugs and new ways to treat cancer.
7.16.352	In breast cancer, for example, many proteins are overexpressed.
7.16.353	This can lead to increased phosphorylation of key transcription factors that increase transcription.
7.16.354	One such example is the overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a subset of breast cancers.
7.16.355	The EGFR pathway activates many protein kinases that, in turn, activate many transcription factors that control genes involved in cell growth.
7.16.356	New drugs that prevent the activation of EGFR have been developed and are used to treat these cancers.
7.16.357	Cancer and Post-transcriptional Control Changes in the post-transcriptional control of a gene can also result in cancer.
7.16.358	Recently, several groups of researchers have shown that specific cancers have altered expression of miRNAs.
7.16.359	Because miRNAs bind to the 3' UTR of RNA molecules to degrade them
7.16.360	, overexpression of these miRNAs could be detrimental to normal cellular activity.
7.16.361	Too many miRNAs could dramatically decrease the RNA population leading to a decrease in protein expression.
7.16.362	Several studies have demonstrated a change in the miRNA population in specific cancer types.
7.16.363	It appears that the subset of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer cells is quite different from the subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells.
7.16.364	This suggests that alterations in miRNA activity can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells.
7.16.365	These types of studies also suggest that if some miRNAs are specifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be potential drug targets.
7.16.366	It would, therefore, be conceivable that new drugs that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat cancer.
7.16.367	Cancer and Translational/Post-translational Control
7.16.368	There are many examples of how translational or post-translational modifications of proteins arise in cancer.
7.16.369	Modifications are found in cancer cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein phosphorylation to alternative splice variants of a protein.
7.16.370	An example of how the expression of an alternative form of a protein can have dramatically different outcomes is seen in colon cancer cells.
7.16.371	The c-Flip protein, a protein involved in mediating the cell death pathway, comes in two forms: long (c-FLIPL) and short (c-FLIPS).
7.16.372	Both forms appear to be involved in initiating controlled cell death mechanisms in normal cells.
7.16.373	However, in colon cancer cells, expression of the long form results in increased cell growth instead of cell death.
7.16.374	Clearly, the expression of the wrong protein dramatically alters cell function and contributes to the development of cancer.
7.16.375	New Drugs to Combat Cancer:
7.16.376	Targeted Therapies Scientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression in disease states, including cancer, to develop new ways to treat and prevent disease development.
7.16.377	Many scientists are designing drugs on the basis of the gene expression patterns within individual tumors.
7.16.378	This idea, that therapy and medicines can be tailored to an individual, has given rise to the field of personalized medicine.
7.16.379	With an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to specifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells.
7.16.380	Some new medicines, called targeted therapies, have exploited the overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease.
7.16.381	One such example is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the EGF protein.
7.16.382	Undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about how gene expression changes can cause cancer.
7.16.383	Clinical Trial Coordinator
7.16.384	A clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial.
7.16.385	This job includes coordinating patient schedules and appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track patients (especially for long-term follow-up studies), ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and accepted, and working with the nurses and doctors to facilitate the trial and publication of the results.
7.16.386	A clinical trial coordinator may have a science background, like a nursing degree, or other certification.
7.16.387	People who have worked in science labs or in clinical offices are also qualified to become a clinical trial coordinator.
7.16.388	These jobs are generally in hospitals; however, some clinics and doctor’s offices also conduct clinical trials and may hire a coordinator.
7.17.0	BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GENOMICS
7.17.1	In genomics, the DNA of different organisms is compared, enabling scientists to create maps with which to navigate the DNA of different organisms.
7.17.2	Introduction
7.17.3	The study of nucleic acids began with the discovery of DNA, progressed to the study of genes and small fragments, and has now exploded to the field of genomics.
7.17.4	Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species.
7.17.5	The advances in genomics have been made possible by DNA sequencing technology.
7.17.6	Just as information technology has led to Google maps that enable people to get detailed information about locations around the globe, genomic information is used to create similar maps of the DNA of different organisms.
7.17.7	These findings have helped anthropologists to better understand human migration and have aided the field of medicine through the mapping of human genetic diseases.
7.17.8	The ways in which genomic information can contribute to scientific understanding are varied and quickly growing.
7.17.9	Biotechnology Biotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement.
7.17.10	Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood.
7.17.11	Since the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, the field of biotechnology has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies.
7.17.12	The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture (genetic modification of crops, such as to increase yields).
7.17.13	Biotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as fermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the production of biofuels (Figure 17.2).
7.17.14	Antibiotics are chemicals produced by fungi, bacteria, and other organisms that have antimicrobial properties.
7.17.15	The first antibiotic discovered was penicillin.
7.17.16	Antibiotics are now commercially produced and tested for their potential to inhibit bacterial growth.

7.17.18	Basic Techniques to Manipulate Genetic Material (DNA and RNA)
7.17.19	To understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids, remember that nucleic acids are macromolecules made of nucleotides (a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds.
7.17.20	The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge.
7.17.21	An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome.
7.17.22	DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases.
7.17.23	The two strands can be separated by exposure to high temperatures (DNA denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling.
7.17.24	The DNA can be replicated by the DNA polymerase enzyme.
7.17.25	Unlike DNA, which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the nucleus.
7.17.26	The most common type of RNA that is analyzed is the messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the proteincoding genes that are actively expressed.
7.17.27	However, RNA molecules present some other challenges to analysis, as they are often less stable than DNA.
7.17.28	DNA and RNA Extraction To study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA or RNA must first be isolated or extracted from the cells.
7.17.29	Various techniques are used to extract different types of DNA (Figure 17.3).
7.17.30	Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample).
7.17.31	Cells are broken using a lysis buffer (a solution which is mostly a detergent); lysis means “to split.
7.17.32	”
7.17.33	These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes.
7.17.34	Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins, and ribonucleases (RNAses) that break down RNA.
7.17.35	The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol.
7.17.36	Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a gelatinous, white mass.
7.17.37	The DNA samples can be stored frozen at –80°C for several years.
7.17.38	This diagram shows the basic method used for extraction of DNA.
7.17.39	RNA analysis is performed to study gene expression patterns in cells.
7.17.40	RNA is naturally very unstable because RNAses are commonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate.
7.17.41	Similar to DNA, RNA extraction involves the use of various buffers and enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the RNA.
7.17.42	Gel Electrophoresis
7.17.43	Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment, they can be mobilized by an electric field.
7.17.44	Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this charge.
7.17.45	The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments.
7.17.46	The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel.
7.17.47	Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size.
7.17.48	There are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the molecules to provide a size comparison.
7.17.49	Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored dyes.
7.17.50	Distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their size (Figure 17.4).
7.17.51	A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.
7.17.52	Shown are DNA fragments from seven samples run on a gel, stained with a fluorescent dye, and viewed under UV light.

7.17.54	Amplification of Nucleic Acid Fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction
7.17.55	Although genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk, DNA analysis often requires focusing on one or more specific regions of the genome.
7.17.56	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify specific regions of DNA for further analysis (Figure 17.5).
7.17.57	PCR is used for many purposes in laboratories, such as the cloning of gene fragments to analyze genetic diseases, identification of contaminant foreign DNA in a sample, and the amplification of DNA for sequencing.
7.17.58	More practical applications include the determination of paternity and detection of genetic diseases.
7.17.59	Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is used to amplify a specific sequence of DNA.
7.17.60	Primers—short pieces of DNA complementary to each end of the target sequence—are combined with genomic DNA, Taq polymerase, and deoxynucleotides.
7.17.61	Taq polymerase is a DNA polymerase isolated from the thermostable bacterium Thermus aquaticus that is able to withstand the high temperatures used in PCR.
7.17.62	Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park.
7.17.63	Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is similar to PCR, but cDNA is made from an RNA template before PCR begins.
7.17.64	DNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).
7.17.65	The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand (called cDNA) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA.
7.17.66	This process is called reverse transcription.
7.17.67	This requires the presence of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase.
7.17.68	After the cDNA is made, regular PCR can be used to amplify it.
7.17.69	Hybridization, Southern Blotting, and Northern Blotting Nucleic acid samples, such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts, can be probed for the presence of certain sequences.
7.17.70	Short DNA fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid detection.
7.17.71	Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size.
7.17.72	The fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting (Figure 17.6).
7.17.73	The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences.
7.17.74	When DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, the technique is called Southern blotting, and when RNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, it is called northern blotting.
7.17.75	Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome, and northern blots are used to detect gene expression.
7.17.76	Southern blotting is used to find a particular sequence in a sample of DNA.
7.17.77	DNA fragments are separated on a gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and incubated with a DNA probe complementary to the sequence of interest.
7.17.78	Northern blotting is similar to Southern blotting, but RNA is run on the gel instead of DNA.
7.17.79	In western blotting, proteins are run on a gel and detected using antibodies.
7.17.80	Molecular Cloning
7.17.81	In general, the word “cloning” means the creation of a perfect replica; however, in biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as “reproductive cloning.
7.17.82	”
7.17.83	Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to reproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome, a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.
7.17.84	Cloning small fragments of the genome allows for the manipulation and study of specific genes (and their protein products), or noncoding regions in isolation.
7.17.85	A plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA.
7.17.86	In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a "folder" in which to insert a desired DNA fragment.
7.17.87	Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation.
7.17.88	In the bacterial context, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is referred to as foreign DNA, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium, which is called the host DNA.
7.17.89	Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as Escherichia coli) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics).
7.17.90	Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as insulin and human growth hormone.
7.17.91	An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site (MCS).
7.17.92	The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases.
7.17.93	Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA.
7.17.94	Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang.
7.17.95	Because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary overhangs, these are called “sticky ends.
7.17.96	”
7.17.97	Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase permanently joins the DNA fragments via phosphodiester bonds.
7.17.98	In this way, any DNA fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction endonuclease (Figure 17.7).
7.17.99	Recombinant DNA Molecules Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature.
7.17.100	They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis.
7.17.101	Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins.
7.17.102	Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes.
7.17.103	The recombinant DNA may need to be moved into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene expression.
7.17.104	Plasmids may also be engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so that scientists can control the expression of the recombinant proteins.
7.17.105	Cellular Cloning Unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission; this is known as cellular cloning.
7.17.106	The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis, which creates an exact replica of the genetic material.
7.17.107	Reproductive Cloning Reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism.
7.17.108	Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent.
7.17.109	Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.
7.17.110	Parthenogenesis, or “virgin birth,” occurs when an embryo grows and develops without the fertilization of the egg occurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction.
7.17.111	An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male.
7.17.112	The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg.
7.17.113	Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.
7.17.114	Sexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results.
7.17.115	The zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual.
7.17.116	However, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell.
7.17.117	This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning.
7.17.118	Therefore, if the haploid nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (called a donor), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor.
7.17.119	Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg.
7.17.120	It can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.
7.17.121	The first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996.
7.17.122	The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low.
7.17.123	Dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications (Figure 17.8).
7.17.124	There is speculation that because the cell DNA belongs to an older individual, the age of the DNA may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual.
7.17.125	Since Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities.
7.17.126	There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes.
7.17.127	Therapeutic cloning produces stem cells to attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism).
7.17.128	Still, therapeutic cloning efforts have met with resistance because of bioethical considerations.
7.17.129	Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be cloned.
7.17.130	To create Dolly, the nucleus was removed from a donor egg cell.
7.17.131	The nucleus from a second sheep was then introduced into the cell, which was allowed to divide to the blastocyst stage before being implanted in a surrogate mother.
7.17.132	Genetic Engineering Genetic engineering is the alteration of an organism’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism’s DNA to achieve desirable traits.
7.17.133	The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering.
7.17.134	The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism (GMO).
7.17.135	If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called transgenic.
7.17.136	Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes.
7.17.137	In the US, GMOs such as Roundup-ready soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed foods.
7.17.138	Gene Targeting
7.17.139	Although classical methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: "What does this gene or DNA element do?
7.17.140	"
7.17.141	This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology.
7.17.142	This method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its function.
7.17.143	An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the function of the wing is flight.
7.17.144	The classical genetic method would compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that the non-flying insects have lost wings.
7.17.145	Similarly, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function.
7.17.146	The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting.
7.17.147	Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism.
7.17.148	Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture
7.17.149	It is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes.
7.17.150	Knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species, the genetic basis of heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant genes provides methods to treat the disease.
7.17.151	Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental stress, and improve both crop yield and quality.
7.17.152	Genetic Diagnosis and Gene Therapy
7.17.153	The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing.
7.17.154	Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic testing.
7.17.155	For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development.
7.17.156	Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer.
7.17.157	If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer.
7.17.158	Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases.
7.17.159	Gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease.
7.17.160	In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene.
7.17.161	The good gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign DNA (Figure 17.9).
7.17.162	More advanced forms of gene therapy try to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the case with treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).
7.17.163	Production of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones Traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms to mount the initial immune response.
7.17.164	Modern techniques use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the desired antigen.
7.17.165	The antigen is then introduced into the body to stimulate the primary immune response and trigger immune memory.
7.17.166	Genes cloned from the influenza virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.
7.17.167	Antibiotics are a biotechnological product.
7.17.168	They are naturally produced by microorganisms, such as fungi, to attain an advantage over bacterial populations.
7.17.169	Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells.
7.17.170	Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin in E. coli as early as 1978.
7.17.171	Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans because of differences in the gene product.
7.17.172	In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders in children.
7.17.173	The HGH gene was cloned from a cDNA library and inserted into E. coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector.
7.17.174	Transgenic Animals
7.17.175	Although several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins require a eukaryotic animal host for proper processing.
7.17.176	For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice.
7.17.177	Animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA are called transgenic animals.
7.17.178	Several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic sheep and goats, and some are expressed in the eggs of chickens.
7.17.179	Mice have been used extensively for expressing and studying the effects of recombinant genes and mutations.
7.17.180	Transgenic Plants Manipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide and pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (Figure 17.10).
7.17.181	Plants are the most important source of food for the human population.
7.17.182	Farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long before modern-day biotechnology practices were established.
7.17.183	Plants that have received recombinant DNA from other species are called transgenic plants.
7.17.184	Because they are not natural, transgenic plants and other GMOs are closely monitored by government agencies to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and do not endanger other plant and animal life.
7.17.185	Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment, extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability.
7.17.186	Staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the first crop plants to be genetically engineered.
7.17.187	Transformation of Plants Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens
7.17.188	Gene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations.
7.17.189	Many viruses that cause human diseases, such as cancer, act by incorporating their DNA into the human genome.
7.17.190	In plants, tumors caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens occur by transfer of DNA from the bacterium to the plant.
7.17.191	Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they make the plants stunted and more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions.
7.17.192	Many plants, such as walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets, are affected by A. tumefaciens.
7.17.193	The artificial introduction of DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells because of the thick plant cell wall.
7.17.194	Researchers used the natural transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their choice into plant hosts.
7.17.195	In nature, the disease-causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, called the Ti plasmids (tumorinducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants.
7.17.196	DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell’s genome.
7.17.197	Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the desired DNA fragment for transfer into the plant genome.
7.17.198	The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes to aid selection and can be propagated in E. coli cells as well.
7.17.199	The Organic Insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis Bacillus thuringiensis
7.17.200	(Bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many insect species that affect plants.
7.17.201	Bt toxin has to be ingested by insects for the toxin to be activated.
7.17.202	Insects that have eaten Bt toxin stop feeding on the plants within a few hours.
7.17.203	After the toxin is activated in the intestines of the insects, death occurs within a couple of days.
7.17.204	Modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects.
7.17.205	The crystal toxin genes have been cloned from Bt and introduced into plants.
7.17.206	Bt toxin has been found to be safe for the environment, non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and is approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide.
7.17.207	Flavr Savr Tomato
7.17.208	The first GM crop to be introduced into the market was the Flavr Savr Tomato produced in 1994.
7.17.209	Antisense RNA technology was used to slow down the process of softening and rotting caused by fungal infections, which led to increased shelf life of the GM tomatoes.
7.17.210	Additional genetic modification improved the flavor of this tomato.
7.17.211	The Flavr Savr tomato did not successfully stay in the market because of problems maintaining and shipping the crop.
7.17.212	Mapping Genomes Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species.
7.17.213	Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome.
7.17.214	The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets.
7.17.215	A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome.
7.17.216	Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks).
7.17.217	A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait.
7.17.218	Early geneticists called this linkage analysis.
7.17.219	Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map).
7.17.220	A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers.
7.17.221	Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome.
7.17.222	Having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes.
7.17.223	Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis.
7.17.224	Genome mapping can be used in a variety of other applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution.
7.17.225	Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change.
7.17.226	Genetic Maps
7.17.227	The study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment.
7.17.228	The term linkage was used before the discovery of DNA.
7.17.229	Early geneticists relied on the observation of phenotypic changes to understand the genotype of an organism.
7.17.230	Shortly after Gregor Mendel (the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits were determined by what are now known as genes, other researchers observed that different traits were often inherited together, and thereby deduced that the genes were physically linked by being located on the same chromosome.
7.17.231	The mapping of genes relative to each other based on linkage analysis led to the development of the first genetic maps.
7.17.232	Observations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the offspring of crosses between parents with different traits.
7.17.233	For example, in experiments performed on the garden pea, it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant’s pollen were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome.
7.17.234	The exchange of DNA between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination, which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between homologous strands of DNA, such as nonsister chromatids.
7.17.235	Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes.
7.17.236	The greater the distance between two genes, the higher the chance that a recombination event will occur between them, and the higher the recombination frequency between them.
7.17.237	Two possibilities for recombination between two nonsister chromatids during meiosis are shown in Figure 17.11.
7.17.238	If the recombination frequency between two genes is less than 50 percent, they are said to be linked.
7.17.239	Crossover may occur at different locations on the chromosome.
7.17.240	Recombination between
7.17.241	genes A and B is more frequent than recombination between genes B and C because genes A and B are farther apart; a crossover is therefore more likely to occur between them.
7.17.242	The generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains).
7.17.243	Early genetic maps were based on the use of known genes as markers.
7.17.244	More sophisticated markers, including those based on non-coding DNA, are now used to compare the genomes of individuals in a population.
7.17.245	Although individuals of a given species are genetically similar, they are not identical; every individual has a unique set of traits.
7.17.246	These minor differences in the genome between individuals in a population are useful for the purposes of genetic mapping.
7.17.247	In general, a good genetic marker is a region on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population.
7.17.248	Some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), microsatellite polymorphisms, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
7.17.249	RFLPs (sometimes pronounced “
7.17.250	rif-lips”) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments, which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
7.17.251	The DNA of every individual will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular set of restriction endonucleases; this is sometimes referred to as an individual’s DNA “fingerprint.
7.17.252	”
7.17.253	Certain regions of the chromosome that are subject to polymorphism will lead to the generation of the unique banding pattern.
7.17.254	VNTRs are repeated sets of nucleotides present in the non-coding regions of DNA.
7.17.255	Non-coding, or “junk,” DNA has no known biological function; however, research shows that much of this DNA is actually transcribed.
7.17.256	While its function is uncertain, it is certainly active, and it may be involved in the regulation of coding genes.
7.17.257	The number of repeats may vary in individual organisms of a population.
7.17.258	Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar to VNTRs, but the repeat unit is very small.
7.17.259	SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide.
7.17.260	Because genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, mapping is affected by natural increases or decreases in the level of recombination in any given area of the genome.
7.17.261	Some parts of the genome are recombination hotspots, whereas others do not show a propensity for recombination.
7.17.262	For this reason, it is important to look at mapping information developed by multiple methods.
7.17.263	Physical Maps
7.17.264	A physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers, as well as the number of nucleotides.
7.17.265	There are three methods used to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and sequence mapping.
7.17.266	Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome (Figure 17.12).
7.17.267	It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping, but not the exact distance (number of base pairs).
7.17.268	Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation, such as x-rays, to break the DNA into fragments.
7.17.269	The amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments.
7.17.270	This technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency.
7.17.271	Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs.
7.17.272	The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries (collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome) has sped up the process of physical mapping.
7.17.273	A genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology (a sequence-tagged site, or STS) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location.
7.17.274	An expressed sequence tag (EST) and a single sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) are common STSs.
7.17.275	An EST is a short STS that is identified with cDNA libraries, while SSLPs are obtained from known genetic markers and provide a link between genetic maps and physical maps.
7.17.276	cytogenetic map shows the appearance of a chromosome after it is stained and examined under a microscope.
7.17.277	(credit: National Human Genome Research Institute) Integration of Genetic and Physical Maps Genetic maps provide the outline and physical maps provide the details.
7.17.278	It is easy to understand why both types of genome mapping techniques are important to show the big picture.
7.17.279	Information obtained from each technique is used in combination to study the genome.
7.17.280	Genomic mapping is being used with different model organisms that are used for research.
7.17.281	Genome mapping is still an ongoing process, and as more advanced techniques are developed, more advances are expected.
7.17.282	Genome mapping is similar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of available data.
7.17.283	Mapping information generated in laboratories all over the world is entered into central databases, such as GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
7.17.284	(NCBI).
7.17.285	Efforts are being made to make the information more easily accessible to researchers and the general public.
7.17.286	Just as we use global positioning systems instead of paper maps to navigate through roadways, NCBI has created a genome viewer tool to simplify the data-mining process.
7.17.287	Whole-Genome Sequencing
7.17.288	Although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years, doctors are still confounded by some diseases, and they are using whole-genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem.
7.17.289	Whole-genome sequencing is a process that determines the DNA sequence of an entire genome.
7.17.290	Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease.
7.17.291	Several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and interpret entire genomes.
7.17.292	For example, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing.
7.17.293	In exome sequencing, only the coding, exon-producing regions of the DNA are sequenced.
7.17.294	In 2010, whole-exome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses.
7.17.295	The child had several colon operations with no relief.
7.17.296	Finally, whole-exome sequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death).
7.17.297	A bone-marrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy.
7.17.298	He was the first person to be successfully treated based on a diagnosis made by whole-exome sequencing.
7.17.299	Today, human genome sequencing is more readily available and can be completed in a day or two for about $1000.
7.17.300	Strategies Used in Sequencing Projects
7.17.301	The basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the dideoxy method), which was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s.
7.17.302	The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single-stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide (dNTP), which is a monomer, or a single unit, of DNA.
7.17.303	The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs).
7.17.304	The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (–OH) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain (Figure 17.13).
7.17.305	Each ddNTP is labeled with a different color of fluorophore.
7.17.306	Every time a ddNTP is incorporated in the growing complementary strand, it terminates the process of DNA replication, which results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA that are each terminated at a different point during replication.
7.17.307	When the reaction mixture is processed by gel electrophoresis after being separated into single strands, the multiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes.
7.17.308	Because the ddNTPs are fluorescently labeled, each band on the gel reflects the size of the DNA strand and the ddNTP that terminated the reaction.
7.17.309	The different colors of the fluorophore-labeled ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at that position.
7.17.310	Reading the gel on the basis of the color of each band on the ladder produces the sequence of the template strand (Figure 17.14).
7.17.311	A dideoxynucleotide is similar in structure to a deoxynucleotide, but is missing the 3' hydroxyl group (indicated by the box).
7.17.312	When a dideoxynucleotide is incorporated into a DNA strand, DNA synthesis stops.
7.17.313	Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method is illustrated.
7.17.314	Using dideoxynucleotides, the DNA fragment can be terminated at different points.
7.17.315	The DNA is separated on the basis of size, and these bands, based on the size of the fragments, can be read.
7.17.316	Early Strategies: Shotgun Sequencing and Pair-Wise End
7.17.317	Sequencing
7.17.318	In shotgun sequencing method, several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces (somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun).
7.17.319	All of the segments are then sequenced using the chain-sequencing method.
7.17.320	Then, with the help of a computer, the fragments are analyzed to see where their sequences overlap.
7.17.321	By matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment, the entire DNA sequence can be reformed.
7.17.322	A larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig.
7.17.323	As an analogy, consider that someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear.
7.17.324	The person then rips up each photograph with their hands, so that different size pieces are present from each copy.
7.17.325	The person then mixes all of the pieces together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph.
7.17.326	In one of the smaller pieces you see a mountain.
7.17.327	In a larger piece, you see that the same mountain is behind a lake.
7.17.328	A third fragment shows only the lake, but it reveals that there is a cabin on the shore of the lake.
7.17.329	Therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in these three fragments, you know that the picture contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore.
7.17.330	This is the principle behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using shotgun sequencing.
7.17.331	Originally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps.
7.17.332	This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes.
7.17.333	However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the development of doublebarrel shotgun sequencing, more formally known as pairwise-end sequencing.
7.17.334	In pairwise-end sequencing, both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap.
7.17.335	Pairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence because there is more available information.
7.17.336	Next-generation Sequencing Since 2005,
7.17.337	automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing, which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing.
7.17.338	These automated low-cost sequencers can generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day.
7.17.339	These sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.
7.17.340	Comparing Sequences
7.17.341	A sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA; it is used to identify regions of similarity between cell types or species, which may indicate conservation of function or structures.
7.17.342	Sequence alignments may be used to construct phylogenetic trees.
7.17.343	The following website uses a software program called BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) .
7.17.344	Under “Basic Blast,” click “Nucleotide Blast.
7.17.345	”
7.17.346	Input the following sequence into the large "query sequence" box: ATTGCTTCGATTGCA.
7.17.347	Below the box, locate the "Species" field and type "human" or "Homo sapiens".
7.17.348	Then click “BLAST” to compare the inputted sequence against known sequences of the human genome.
7.17.349	The result is that this sequence occurs in over a hundred places in the human genome.
7.17.350	Scroll down below the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see short description of each of the matching hits.
7.17.351	Pick one of the hits near the top of the list and click on "Graphics".
7.17.352	This will bring you to a page that shows where the sequence is found within the entire human genome.
7.17.353	You can move the slider that looks like a green flag back and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene.
7.17.354	You can then return to your selected sequence by clicking the "ATG" button.
7.17.355	Use of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms
7.17.356	The first genome to be completely sequenced was of a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs); this was accomplished by Fred Sanger using shotgun sequencing.
7.17.357	Several other organelle and viral genomes were later sequenced.
7.17.358	The first organism whose genome was sequenced was the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae; this was accomplished by Craig Venter in the 1980s.
7.17.359	Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on the sequencing of the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome that had been sequenced.
7.17.360	By 1997, the genome sequences of two important model organisms were available: the bacterium Escherichia coli K12 and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
7.17.361	Genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouse
7.17.362	Mus musculus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode Caenorhabditis. elegans, and humans Homo sapiens are now known.
7.17.363	A lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to genetically similar organisms.
7.17.364	A model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species represented by the model organism.
7.17.365	Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms.
7.17.366	The process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome annotation.
7.17.367	Annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology, such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets.
7.17.368	Uses of Genome Sequences DNA microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of DNA fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences.
7.17.369	Almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays, whereas whole-genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome.
7.17.370	Although the study of medical applications of genome sequencing is interesting, this discipline tends to dwell on abnormal gene function.
7.17.371	Knowledge of the entire genome will allow future onset diseases and other genetic disorders to be discovered early, which will allow for more informed decisions to be made about lifestyle, medication, and having children.
7.17.372	Genomics is still in its infancy, although someday it may become routine to use whole-genome sequencing to screen every newborn to detect genetic abnormalities.
7.17.373	In addition to disease and medicine, genomics can contribute to the development of novel enzymes that convert biomass to biofuel, which results in higher crop and fuel production, and lower cost to the consumer.
7.17.374	This knowledge should allow better methods of control over the microbes that are used in the production of biofuels.
7.17.375	Genomics could also improve the methods used to monitor the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and help clean up environmental contaminants.
7.17.376	Genomics has allowed for the development of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals that could benefit medical science and agriculture.
7.17.377	It sounds great to have all the knowledge we can get from whole-genome sequencing; however, humans have a responsibility to use this knowledge wisely.
7.17.378	Otherwise, it could be easy to misuse the power of such knowledge, leading to discrimination based on a person's genetics, human genetic engineering, and other ethical concerns.
7.17.379	This information could also lead to legal issues regarding health and privacy.
7.17.380	Applying Genomics
7.17.381	The introduction of DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the Human Genome project, has expanded the applicability of DNA sequence information.
7.17.382	Genomics is now being used in a wide variety of fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial genomics.
7.17.383	The most commonly known application of genomics is to understand and find cures for diseases.
7.17.384	Predicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level Predicting the risk of disease involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level.
7.17.385	Intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset.
7.17.386	However, this approach is most applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect.
7.17.387	Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries.
7.17.388	Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic, which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet.
7.17.389	In April 2010, scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases.
7.17.390	A risk assessment was performed to analyze Quake’s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions.
7.17.391	A rare genetic mutation was found, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack.
7.17.392	He was also predicted to have a 23 percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer’s.
7.17.393	The scientists used databases and several publications to analyze the genomic data.
7.17.394	Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools are becoming more reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level remain to be addressed.
7.17.395	PCA3 is a gene that is expressed in prostate epithelial cells and overexpressed in cancerous cells.
7.17.396	A high concentration of PCA3 in urine is indicative of prostate cancer.
7.17.397	The PCA3 test is considered to be a better indicator of cancer than the more well know PSA test, which measures the level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in the blood.
7.17.398	In 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer.
7.17.399	Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer.
7.17.400	Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side effects.
7.17.401	The PCA3 test is considered to be more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment.
7.17.402	What do you think?
7.17.403	Should all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the PCA3 or PSA test?
7.17.404	Should people in general be screened to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?Pharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics Pharmacogenomics, also called toxicogenomics, involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual's genomic sequence.
7.17.405	Genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats or mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans.
7.17.406	Studying changes in gene expression could provide information about the transcription profile in the presence of the drug, which can be used as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects.
7.17.407	For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of cancerous cells.
7.17.408	Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity.
7.17.409	Personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of the individual patient’s genotype.
7.17.410	The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.
7.17.411	Microbial Genomics:
7.17.412	Metagenomics Traditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory.
7.17.413	Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly.
7.17.414	In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in isolation.
7.17.415	Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms.
7.17.416	For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms.
7.17.417	Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche.
7.17.418	Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment (Figure 17.16).
7.17.419	Microbial Genomics: Creation of New Biofuels Knowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better ways to harness biofuels from algae and cyanobacteria.
7.17.420	The primary sources of fuel today are coal, oil, wood, and other plant products, such as ethanol.
7.17.421	Although plants are renewable resources, there is still a need to find more alternative renewable sources of energy to meet our population’s energy demands.
7.17.422	The microbial world is one of the largest resources for genes that encode new enzymes and produce new organic compounds, and it remains largely untapped.
7.17.423	Microorganisms are used to create products, such as enzymes that are used in research, antibiotics, and other anti-microbial mechanisms.
7.17.424	Microbial genomics is helping to develop diagnostic tools, improved vaccines, new disease treatments, and advanced environmental cleanup techniques.
7.17.425	Mitochondrial Genomics Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own DNA.
7.17.426	Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a rapid rate and is often used to study evolutionary relationships.
7.17.427	Another feature that makes studying the mitochondrial genome interesting is that the mitochondrial DNA in most multicellular organisms is passed on from the mother during the process of fertilization.
7.17.428	For this reason, mitochondrial genomics is often used to trace genealogy.
7.17.429	Information and clues obtained from DNA samples found at crime scenes have been used as evidence in court cases, and genetic markers have been used in forensic analysis.
7.17.430	Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field.
7.17.431	In 2001, the first use of genomics in forensics was published.
7.17.432	It was a collaborative attempt between academic research institutions and the FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via the US Postal Service.
7.17.433	Using microbial genomics, researchers determined that a specific strain of anthrax was used in all the mailings.
7.17.434	Genomics in Agriculture Genomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent, which could improve the quality and quantity of crop yields in agriculture.
7.17.435	Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities.
7.17.436	Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different organism.
7.17.437	Scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production.
7.17.438	For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.
7.17.439	Proteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function encoded by the gene.
7.17.440	Proteins are composed of amino acids and play important roles in the cell.
7.17.441	All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of reactions.
7.17.442	Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones.
7.17.443	Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs.
7.17.444	Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins.
7.17.445	In the diseased state, protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein.
7.17.446	A proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type.
7.17.447	Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins.
7.17.448	Although mRNA analysis is a step in the right direction, not all mRNAs are translated into proteins.
7.17.449	The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics.
7.17.450	Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes.
7.17.451	Even though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression.
7.17.452	Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism.
7.17.453	In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced (cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins) and many proteins are modified after translation by processes such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination.
7.17.454	There are also protein-protein interactions, which complicate the study of proteomes.
7.17.455	Although the genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the proteome.
7.17.456	Metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics.
7.17.457	Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism.
7.17.458	The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism.
7.17.459	Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic makeup and environmental factors.
7.17.460	The goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all of the metabolites that are found in the tissues and fluids of living organisms.
7.17.461	Basic Techniques in Protein Analysis
7.17.462	The ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific conditions, study the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug targets.
7.17.463	Just as the genome is analyzed using the basic technique of DNA sequencing, proteomics requires techniques for protein analysis.
7.17.464	The basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry.
7.17.465	Mass spectrometry is used to identify and determine the characteristics of a molecule.
7.17.466	Advances in spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small samples of protein.
7.17.467	X-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein crystal at atomic resolution.
7.17.468	Another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), uses the magnetic properties of atoms to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins in aqueous solution.
7.17.469	Protein microarrays have also been used to study interactions between proteins.
7.17.470	Large-scale adaptations of the basic two-hybrid screen (Figure 17.17) have provided the basis for protein microarrays.
7.17.471	Computer software is used to analyze the vast amount of data generated for proteomic analysis.
7.17.472	Genomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part of systems biology.
7.17.473	Systems biology is the study of whole biological systems (genomes and proteomes) based on interactions within the system.
7.17.474	The European Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data.
7.17.475	Because proteins are the direct products of genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is natural to use proteomes to compare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and genes involved in disease processes.
7.17.476	Most pharmaceutical drug trials target proteins.
7.17.477	Information obtained from proteomics is being used to identify novel drugs and understand their mechanisms of action.
7.17.478	Two-hybrid screening is used to determine whether two proteins interact.
7.17.479	In this method, a transcription factor is split into a DNA-binding domain (BD) and an activator domain (AD).
7.17.480	The binding domain is able to bind the promoter in the absence of the activator domain, but it does not turn on transcription.
7.17.481	A protein called the bait is attached to the BD, and a protein called the prey is attached to the AD.
7.17.482	Transcription occurs only if the prey “catches” the bait.
7.17.483	The challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of proteins.
7.17.484	Although mass spectrometry is good for detecting small amounts of proteins, variations in protein expression in diseased states can be difficult to discern.
7.17.485	Proteins are naturally unstable molecules, which makes proteomic analysis much more difficult than genomic analysis.
7.17.486	Cancer Proteomics Genomes and proteomes of patients suffering from specific diseases are being studied to understand the genetic basis of the disease.
7.17.487	The most prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer.
7.17.488	Proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process.
7.17.489	An individual protein is called a biomarker, whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature.
7.17.490	For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer, it must be secreted in body fluids, such as sweat, blood, or urine, such that largescale screenings can be performed in a non-invasive fashion.
7.17.491	The current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false-negative results.
7.17.492	A false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive.
7.17.493	In other words, many cases of cancer go undetected, which makes biomarkers unreliable.
7.17.494	Some examples of protein biomarkers used in cancer detection are CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer.
7.17.495	Protein signatures may be more reliable than biomarkers to detect cancer cells.
7.17.496	Proteomics is also being used to develop individualized treatment plans, which involves the prediction of whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side effects that the individual may experience.
7.17.497	Proteomics is also being used to predict the possibility of disease recurrence.
7.17.498	The National Cancer Institute has developed programs to improve the detection and treatment of cancer.
7.17.499	The Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer and the Early Detection Research Network are efforts to identify protein signatures specific to different types of cancers.
7.17.500	The Biomedical Proteomics Program is designed to identify protein signatures and design effective therapies for cancer patients.   
7.18.0	EVOLUTION AND THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES
7.18.1	All organisms are products of evolution adapted to their environment.
7.18.2	(a) Saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) can soak up 750 liters of water in a single rain storm, enabling these cacti to survive the dry conditions of the Sonora desert in Mexico and the Southwestern United States.
7.18.3	(b)
7.18.4	The Andean semiaquatic lizard (Potamites montanicola) discovered in Peru in 2010 lives between 1,570 to 2,100 meters in elevation, and, unlike most lizards, is nocturnal and swims.
7.18.5	Scientists still do no know how these cold-blood animals are able to move in the cold (10 to 15°C) temperatures of the Andean night.
7.18.6	Introduction
7.18.7	All species of living organisms, from bacteria to baboons to blueberries, evolved at some point from a different species.
7.18.8	Although it may seem that living things today stay much the same, that is not the case—evolution is an ongoing process.
7.18.9	The theory of evolution is the unifying theory of biology, meaning it is the framework within which biologists ask questions about the living world.
7.18.10	Its power is that it provides direction for predictions about living things that are borne out in experiment after experiment.
7.18.11	The Ukrainian-born American geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky famously wrote that “nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of evolution.
7.18.12	”
7.18.13	[1]
7.18.14	He meant that the tenet that all life has evolved and diversified from a common ancestor is the foundation from which we approach all questions in biology.
7.18.15	Understanding Evolution Evolution by natural selection describes a mechanism for how species change over time.
7.18.16	That species change had been suggested and debated well before Darwin began to explore this idea.
7.18.17	The view that species were static and unchanging was grounded in the writings of Plato, yet there were also ancient Greeks who expressed evolutionary ideas.
7.18.18	In the eighteenth century, ideas about the evolution of animals were reintroduced by the naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon who observed that various geographic regions have different plant and animal populations, even when the environments are similar.
7.18.19	It was also accepted that there were extinct species.
7.18.20	During this time, James Hutton, a Scottish naturalist, proposed that geological change occurred gradually by the accumulation of small changes from processes operating like they are today over long periods of time.
7.18.21	This contrasted with the predominant view that the geology of the planet was a consequence of catastrophic events occurring during a relatively brief past.
7.18.22	Hutton’s view was popularized in the nineteenth century by the geologist Charles Lyell who became a friend to Darwin.
7.18.23	Lyell’s ideas were influential on Darwin’s thinking:
7.18.24	Lyell’s notion of the greater age of Earth gave more time for gradual change in species, and the process of change provided an analogy for gradual change in species.
7.18.25	In the early nineteenth century, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a book that detailed a mechanism for evolutionary change.
7.18.26	This mechanism is now referred to as an inheritance of acquired characteristics by which modifications in an individual are caused by its environment, or the use or disuse of a structure during its lifetime, could be inherited by its offspring and thus bring about change in a species.
7.18.27	While this mechanism for evolutionary change was discredited, Lamarck’s ideas were an important influence on evolutionary thought.
7.18.28	Charles Darwin and Natural Selection
7.18.29	In the mid-nineteenth century, the actual mechanism for evolution was independently conceived of and described by two naturalists: Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace.
7.18.30	Importantly, each naturalist spent time exploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics.
7.18.31	From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the world on H.M.S. Beagle, including stops in South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa.
7.18.32	Wallace traveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago from 1854 to 1862.
7.18.33	Darwin’s journey, like Wallace’s later journeys to the Malay Archipelago, included stops at several island chains, the last being the Galápagos Islands west of Ecuador.
7.18.34	On these islands, Darwin observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences.
7.18.35	For example, the ground finches inhabiting the Galápagos Islands comprised several species with a unique beak shape (Figure 18.2).
7.18.36	The species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very small differences between the most similar.
7.18.37	He observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the mainland of South America.
7.18.38	Darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from one of the original mainland species.
7.18.39	Upon further study, he realized that the varied beaks of each finch helped the birds acquire a specific type of food.
7.18.40	For example, seed-eating finches had stronger, thicker beaks for breaking seeds, and insect-eating finches had spear-like beaks for stabbing their prey.
7.18.41	Darwin observed that beak shape varies among finch species.
7.18.42	He postulated that the beak of an ancestral species had adapted over time to equip the finches to acquire different food sources.
7.18.43	Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the same explanation for how and why such changes could take place.
7.18.44	Darwin called this mechanism natural selection.
7.18.45	Natural selection, also known as “survival of the fittest,” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits; this leads to evolutionary change.
7.18.46	For example, a population of giant tortoises found in the Galapagos Archipelago was observed by Darwin to have longer necks than those that lived on other islands with dry lowlands.
7.18.47	These tortoises were
7.18.48	“selected” because they could reach more leaves and access more food than those with short necks.
7.18.49	In times of drought when fewer leaves would be available, those that could reach more leaves had a better chance to eat and survive than those that couldn’t reach the food source.
7.18.50	Consequently, long-necked tortoises would be more likely to be reproductively successful and pass the long-necked trait to their offspring.
7.18.51	Over time, only long-necked tortoises would be present in the population.
7.18.52	Natural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature.
7.18.53	First, most characteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring.
7.18.54	Although no one, including Darwin and Wallace, knew how this happened at the time, it was a common understanding.
7.18.55	Second, more offspring are produced than are able to survive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited.
7.18.56	The capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the availability of resources to support their numbers.
7.18.57	Thus, there is competition for those resources in each generation.
7.18.58	Both Darwin and Wallace’s understanding of this principle came from reading an essay by the economist Thomas Malthus who discussed this principle in relation to human populations.
7.18.59	Third, offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited.
7.18.60	Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics which allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to compete.
7.18.61	Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation.
7.18.62	This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called descent with modification.
7.18.63	Ultimately, natural selection leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment; it is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution.
7.18.64	Papers by Darwin and Wallace
7.18.65	(Figure 18.3) presenting the idea of natural selection were read together in 1858 before the Linnean Society in London.
7.18.66	The following year Darwin’s book, On the Origin of Species, was published.
7.18.67	His book outlined in considerable detail his arguments for evolution by natural selection.
7.18.68	Both (a) Charles Darwin and (b)
7.18.69	Alfred Wallace wrote scientific papers on natural selection that were presented together before the Linnean Society in 1858.
7.18.70	Demonstrations of evolution by natural selection are time consuming and difficult to obtain.
7.18.71	One of the best examples has been demonstrated in the very birds that helped to inspire Darwin’s theory: the Galápagos finches.
7.18.72	Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have studied Galápagos finch populations every year since 1976 and have provided important demonstrations of natural selection.
7.18.73	The Grants found changes from one generation to the next in the distribution of beak shapes with the medium ground finch on the Galápagos island of Daphne Major.
7.18.74	The birds have inherited variation in the bill shape with some birds having wide deep bills and others having thinner bills.
7.18.75	During a period in which rainfall was higher than normal because of an El Niño, the large hard seeds that large-billed birds ate were reduced in number; however, there was an abundance of the small soft seeds which the small-billed birds ate.
7.18.76	Therefore, survival and reproduction were much better in the following years for the small-billed birds.
7.18.77	In the years following this El Niño, the Grants measured beak sizes in the population and found that the average bill size was smaller.
7.18.78	Since bill size is an inherited trait, parents with smaller bills had more offspring and the size of bills had evolved to be smaller.
7.18.79	As conditions improved in 1987 and larger seeds became more available, the trend toward smaller average bill size ceased.
7.18.80	Field Biologist
7.18.81	Many people hike, explore caves, scuba dive, or climb mountains for recreation.
7.18.82	People often participate in these activities hoping to see wildlife.
7.18.83	Experiencing the outdoors can be incredibly enjoyable and invigorating.
7.18.84	What if your job was to be outside in the wilderness?
7.18.85	Field biologists by definition work outdoors in the “field.
7.18.86	”
7.18.87	The term field in this case refers to any location outdoors, even under water.
7.18.88	A field biologist typically focuses research on a certain species, group of organisms, or a single habitat (Figure 18.4).
7.18.89	A field biologist tranquilizes a polar bear for study.
7.18.90	(credit: Karen Rhode)
7.18.91	One objective of many field biologists includes discovering new species that have never been recorded.
7.18.92	Not only do such findings expand our understanding of the natural world, but they also lead to important innovations in fields such as medicine and agriculture.
7.18.93	Plant and microbial species, in particular, can reveal new medicinal and nutritive knowledge.
7.18.94	Other organisms can play key roles in ecosystems or be considered rare and in need of protection.
7.18.95	When discovered, these important species can be used as evidence for environmental regulations and laws.
7.18.96	Processes and Patterns of Evolution
7.18.97	Natural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population.
7.18.98	Importantly, these differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation.
7.18.99	This is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons such as an individual being taller because of better nutrition rather than different genes.
7.18.100	Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction.
7.18.101	Mutation, a change in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population.
7.18.102	The genetic changes caused by mutation can have one of three outcomes on the phenotype.
7.18.103	A mutation affects the phenotype of the organism in a way that gives it reduced fitness—lower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring.
7.18.104	A mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness.
7.18.105	And, many mutations will also have no effect on the fitness of the phenotype; these are called neutral mutations.
7.18.106	Mutations may also have a whole range of effect sizes on the fitness of the organism that expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect.
7.18.107	Sexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity: when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each of the offspring.
7.18.108	A heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation.
7.18.109	Scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the “fit” of the population to its environment.
7.18.110	The webbed feet of platypuses are an adaptation for swimming.
7.18.111	The snow leopards’ thick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold.
7.18.112	The cheetahs’ fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey.
7.18.113	Whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the environmental conditions at the time.
7.18.114	The same traits are not always selected because environmental conditions can change.
7.18.115	For example, consider a species of plant that grew in a moist climate and did not need to conserve water.
7.18.116	Large leaves were selected because they allowed the plant to obtain more energy from the sun.
7.18.117	Large leaves require more water to maintain than small leaves, and the moist environment provided favorable conditions to support large leaves.
7.18.118	After thousands of years, the climate changed, and the area no longer had excess water.
7.18.119	The direction of natural selection shifted so that plants with small leaves were selected because those populations were able to conserve water to survive the new environmental conditions.
7.18.120	The evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function.
7.18.121	Sometimes, evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other.
7.18.122	When two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point, it is called divergent evolution.
7.18.123	Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies; however, they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators (Figure 18.5).
7.18.124	Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor.
7.18.125	Notice that the (a) dense blazing star (Liatrus spicata) and the (b) purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) vary in appearance, yet both share a similar basic morphology.
7.18.126	(credit a: modification of work by Drew Avery; credit b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)
7.18.127	In other cases, similar phenotypes evolve independently in distantly related species.
7.18.128	For example, flight has evolved in both bats and insects, and they both have structures we refer to as wings, which are adaptations to flight.
7.18.129	However, the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures.
7.18.130	This phenomenon is called convergent evolution , where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry.
7.18.131	The two species came to the same function, flying, but did so separately from each other.
7.18.132	These physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs.
7.18.133	Natural selection acts on individual organisms, which in turn can shape an entire species.
7.18.134	Although natural selection may work in a single generation on an individual, it can take thousands or even millions of years for the genotype of an entire species to evolve.
7.18.135	It is over these large time spans that life on earth has changed and continues to change.
7.18.136	Evidence of Evolution
7.18.137	The evidence for evolution is compelling and extensive.
7.18.138	Looking at every level of organization in living systems, biologists see the signature of past and present evolution.
7.18.139	Darwin dedicated a large portion of his book, On the Origin of Species, to identifying patterns in nature that were consistent with evolution, and since Darwin, our understanding has become clearer and broader.
7.18.140	Fossils Fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those found today, and fossils show a progression of evolution.
7.18.141	Scientists determine the age of fossils and categorize them from all over the world to determine when the organisms lived relative to each other.
7.18.142	The resulting fossil record tells the story of the past and shows the evolution of form over millions of years (Figure 18.6).
7.18.143	For example, scientists have recovered highly detailed records showing the evolution of humans and horses (Figure 18.6).
7.18.144	The whale flipper shares a similar morphology to appendages of birds and mammals (Figure 18.7) indicating that these species share a common ancestor.
7.18.145	In this (a) display, fossil hominids are arranged from oldest (bottom) to newest (top).
7.18.146	As hominids evolved, the shape of the skull changed.
7.18.147	An artist’s rendition of (b) extinct species of the genus
7.18.148	Equus reveals that these ancient species resembled the modern horse (Equus ferus) but varied in size.
7.18.149	Anatomy and Embryology Another type of evidence for evolution is the presence of structures in organisms that share the same basic form.
7.18.150	For example, the bones in the appendages of a human, dog, bird, and whale all share the same overall construction (Figure 18.7) resulting from their origin in the appendages of a common ancestor.
7.18.151	Over time, evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species, but they have maintained the same overall layout.
7.18.152	Scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures.
7.18.153	The similar construction of these appendages indicates that these organisms share a common ancestor.
7.18.154	Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all, and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor.
7.18.155	These unused structures without function are called vestigial structures.
7.18.156	Other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds, leaves on some cacti, and hind leg bones in whales.
7.18.157	Another evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments.
7.18.158	For example, species of unrelated animals, such as the arctic fox and ptarmigan, living in the arctic region have been selected for seasonal white phenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice
7.18.159	(Figure 18.8ab).
7.18.160	These similarities occur not because of common ancestry, but because of similar selection pressures—the benefits of not being seen by predators.
7.18.161	The white winter coat of the (a) arctic fox and the (b) ptarmigan’s plumage are adaptations to their environments.
7.18.162	(credit a: modification of work by Keith Morehouse)
7.18.163	Embryology, the study of the development of the anatomy of an organism to its adult form, also provides evidence of relatedness between now widely divergent groups of organisms.
7.18.164	Mutational tweaking in the embryo can have such magnified consequences in the adult that embryo formation tends to be conserved.
7.18.165	As a result, structures that are absent in some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear by the time the adult or juvenile form is reached.
7.18.166	For example, all vertebrate embryos, including humans, exhibit gill slits and tails at some point in their early development.
7.18.167	These disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups but are maintained in adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some amphibians.
7.18.168	Great ape embryos, including humans, have a tail structure during their development that is lost by the time of birth.
7.18.169	Biogeography
7.18.170	The geographic distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that are best explained by evolution in conjunction with the movement of tectonic plates over geological time.
7.18.171	Broad groups that evolved before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea (about 200 million years ago) are distributed worldwide.
7.18.172	Groups that evolved since the breakup appear uniquely in regions of the planet, such as the unique flora and fauna of northern continents that formed from the supercontinent Laurasia and of the southern continents that formed from the supercontinent Gondwana.
7.18.173	The presence of members of the plant family Proteaceae in Australia, southern Africa, and South America is best by their presence prior to the southern supercontinent Gondwana breaking up.
7.18.174	The great diversification of marsupials in Australia and the absence of other mammals reflect Australia’s long isolation.
7.18.175	Australia has an abundance of endemic species—species found nowhere else—which is typical of islands whose isolation by expanses of water prevents species to migrate.
7.18.176	Over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that look very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland.
7.18.177	The marsupials of Australia, the finches on the Galápagos, and many species on the Hawaiian Islands are all unique to their one point of origin, yet they display distant relationships to ancestral species on mainlands.
7.18.178	Molecular Biology
7.18.179	Like anatomical structures, the structures of the molecules of life reflect descent with modification.
7.18.180	Evidence of a common ancestor for all of life is reflected in the universality of DNA as the genetic material and in the near universality of the genetic code and the machinery of DNA replication and expression.
7.18.181	Fundamental divisions in life between the three domains are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as the components of ribosomes and the structures of membranes.
7.18.182	In general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity of their DNA sequences—exactly the pattern that would be expected from descent and diversification from a common ancestor.
7.18.183	DNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution.
7.18.184	For example, it is clear that the evolution of new functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow the free modification of one copy by mutation, selection, or drift (changes in a population’s gene pool resulting from chance), while the second copy continues to produce a functional protein.
7.18.185	Misconceptions of Evolution
7.18.186	Although the theory of evolution generated some controversy when it was first proposed, it was almost universally accepted by biologists, particularly younger biologists, within 20 years after publication of On the Origin of Species.
7.18.187	Nevertheless, the theory of evolution is a difficult concept and misconceptions about how it works abound.
7.18.188	Evolution Is Just a Theory Critics of the theory of evolution dismiss its importance by purposefully confounding the everyday usage of the word “theory” with the way scientists use the word.
7.18.189	In science, a “theory” is understood to be a body of thoroughly tested and verified explanations for a set of observations of the natural world.
7.18.190	Scientists have a theory of the atom, a theory of gravity, and the theory of relativity, each of which describes understood facts about the world.
7.18.191	In the same way, the theory of evolution describes facts about the living world.
7.18.192	As such, a theory in science has survived significant efforts to discredit it by scientists.
7.18.193	In contrast, a “theory” in common vernacular is a word meaning a guess or suggested explanation; this meaning is more akin to the scientific concept of “hypothesis.
7.18.194	”
7.18.195	When critics of evolution say evolution is “just a theory,” they are implying that there is little evidence supporting it and that it is still in the process of being rigorously tested.
7.18.196	This is a mischaracterization.
7.18.197	Individuals Evolve Evolution is the change in genetic composition of a population over time, specifically over generations, resulting from differential reproduction of individuals with certain alleles.
7.18.198	Individuals do change over their lifetime, obviously, but this is called development and involves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination with the individual’s environment.
7.18.199	When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about the change of the average value of the characteristic in the population over time.
7.18.200	For example, when natural selection leads to bill-size change in medium-ground finches in the Galápagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are changing.
7.18.201	If one measures the average bill size among all individuals in the population at one time and then measures the average bill size in the population several years later, this average value will be different as a result of evolution.
7.18.202	Although some individuals may survive from the first time to the second, they will still have the same bill size; however, there will be many new individuals that contribute to the shift in average bill size.
7.18.203	Evolution Explains the Origin of Life
7.18.204	It is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life’s origins.
7.18.205	Conversely, some of the theory’s critics believe that it cannot explain the origin of life.
7.18.206	The theory does not try to explain the origin of life.
7.18.207	The theory of evolution explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species.
7.18.208	It does not shed light on the beginnings of life including the origins of the first cells, which is how life is defined.
7.18.209	The mechanisms of the origin of life on Earth are a particularly difficult problem because it occurred a very long time ago, and presumably it just occurred once.
7.18.210	Importantly, biologists believe that the presence of life on Earth precludes the possibility that the events that led to life on Earth can be repeated because the intermediate stages would immediately become food for existing living things.
7.18.211	However, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell or pre-cell, these entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection.
7.18.212	More effective reproducers would increase in frequency at the expense of inefficient reproducers.
7.18.213	So while evolution does not explain the origin of life, it may have something to say about some of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties.
7.18.214	Organisms Evolve on Purpose Statements such as “organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment
7.18.215	” are quite common, but such statements can lead to two types of misunderstandings.
7.18.216	First, the statement must not be understood to mean that individual organisms evolve.
7.18.217	The statement is shorthand for “a population evolves in response to a changing environment.
7.18.218	”
7.18.219	However, a second misunderstanding may arise by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional.
7.18.220	A changed environment results in some individuals in the population, those with particular phenotypes, benefiting and therefore producing proportionately more offspring than other phenotypes.
7.18.221	This results in change in the population if the characteristics are genetically determined.
7.18.222	It is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise in response to an environmental change.
7.18.223	For example, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will, over time, select a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.
7.18.224	The resistance, which is caused by a gene, did not arise by mutation because of the application of the antibiotic.
7.18.225	The gene for resistance was already present in the gene pool of the bacteria, likely at a low frequency.
7.18.226	The antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects individuals that are resistant, since these would be the only ones that survived and divided.
7.18.227	Experiments have demonstrated that mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a result of antibiotic.
7.18.228	In a larger sense, evolution is not goal directed.
7.18.229	Species do not become “better” over time; they simply track their changing environment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time.
7.18.230	Evolution has no goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species, despite the commonness of this kind of language in popular discourse.
7.18.231	What characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the environment, both of which are constantly changing in a non-directional way.
7.18.232	What trait is fit in one environment at one time may well be fatal at some point in the future.
7.18.233	This holds equally well for a species of insect as it does the human species.
7.18.234	Formation of New Species reproduction and have offspring that can then successfully reproduce.
7.18.235	Scientists call such organisms members of the same biological species.
7.18.236	Species and the Ability to Reproduce
7.18.237	A species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring.
7.18.238	According to this definition, one species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring.
7.18.239	Members of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their DNA.
7.18.240	The closer relationship two organisms share, the more DNA they have in common, just like people and their families.
7.18.241	People’s DNA is likely to be more like their father or mother’s DNA than their cousin or grandparent’s DNA.
7.18.242	Organisms of the same species have the highest level of DNA alignment and therefore share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful reproduction.
7.18.243	Species’ appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate.
7.18.244	For example, even though domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) display phenotypic differences, such as size, build, and coat, most dogs can interbreed and produce viable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce (Figure 18.9).
7.18.245	The (a) poodle and (b) cocker spaniel can reproduce to produce a breed known as (c) the cockapoo.
7.18.246	(credit a: modification of work by Sally Eller, Tom Reese; credit b: modification of work by Jeremy McWilliams; credit c: modification of work by Kathleen Conklin)
7.18.247	In other cases, individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species.
7.18.248	For example, even though bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) are both birds and eagles, each belongs to a separate species group (Figure 18.10).
7.18.249	If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called a hybrid (a cross between two species), would probably be infertile—unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity.
7.18.250	Different species may have different genes that are active in development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions.
7.18.251	Thus, even though hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate.
7.18.252	The (a) African fish eagle is similar in appearance to the (b) bald eagle, but the two birds are members of different species.
7.18.253	(credit a: modification of work by Nigel Wedge; credit b: modification of work by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)
7.18.254	Populations of species share a gene pool: a collection of all the variants of genes in the species.
7.18.255	Again, the basis to any changes in a group or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits.
7.18.256	When variations occur within a species, they can only be passed to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction.
7.18.257	The change will be passed on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait.
7.18.258	For the changed trait to be passed on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell, must possess the changed trait.
7.18.259	In other words, sexually-reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes in their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a sperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next generation.
7.18.260	Only heritable traits can evolve.
7.18.261	Therefore, reproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root in a population or species.
7.18.262	In short, organisms must be able to reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring.
7.18.263	Speciation
7.18.264	The biological definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actually or potentially interbreeding individuals.
7.18.265	There are exceptions to this rule.
7.18.266	Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds.
7.18.267	In fact, the presence in nature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process may not yet be completed.
7.18.268	Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation: the formation of two species from one original species.
7.18.269	Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in On the Origin of Species (Figure 18.11a).
7.18.270	Compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant evolution (Figure 18.11b), which shows that as one species changes over time, it branches to form more than one new species, repeatedly, as long as the population survives or until the organism becomes extinct.
7.18.271	The only illustration in Darwin's On the Origin of Species is (a) a diagram showing speciation events leading to biological diversity.
7.18.272	The diagram shows similarities to phylogenetic charts that are drawn today to illustrate the relationships of species.
7.18.273	(b)
7.18.274	Modern elephants evolved from the Palaeomastodon, a species that lived in Egypt 35–50 million years ago.
7.18.275	For speciation to occur, two new populations must be formed from one original population and they must evolve in such a way that it becomes impossible for individuals from the two new populations to interbreed.
7.18.276	Biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories.
7.18.277	Allopatric speciation (allo- =
7.18.278	"other"; -patric = "homeland") involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution.
7.18.279	Sympatric speciation (sym- =
7.18.280	"same"; -patric = "homeland") involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location.
7.18.281	Biologists think of speciation events as the splitting of one ancestral species into two descendant species.
7.18.282	There is no reason why there might not be more than two species formed at one time except that it is less likely and multiple events can be conceptualized as single splits occurring close in time.
7.18.283	Allopatric Speciation A geographically continuous population has a gene pool that is relatively homogeneous.
7.18.284	Gene flow, the movement of alleles across the range of the species, is relatively free because individuals can move and then mate with individuals in their new location.
7.18.285	Thus, the frequency of an allele at one end of a distribution will be similar to the frequency of the allele at the other end.
7.18.286	When populations become geographically discontinuous, that free-flow of alleles is prevented.
7.18.287	When that separation lasts for a period of time, the two populations are able to evolve along different trajectories.
7.18.288	Thus, their allele frequencies at numerous genetic loci gradually become more and more different as new alleles independently arise by mutation in each population.
7.18.289	Typically, environmental conditions, such as climate, resources, predators, and competitors for the two populations will differ causing natural selection to favor divergent adaptations in each group.
7.18.290	Isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways: a river forming a new branch, erosion forming a new valley, a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to return, or seeds floating over the ocean to an island.
7.18.291	The nature of the geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on the biology of the organism and its potential for dispersal.
7.18.292	If two flying insect populations took up residence in separate nearby valleys, chances are, individuals from each population would fly back and forth continuing gene flow.
7.18.293	However, if two rodent populations became divided by the formation of a new lake, continued gene flow would be unlikely; therefore, speciation would be more likely.
7.18.294	Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories: dispersal and vicariance.
7.18.295	Dispersal is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area, and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms.
7.18.296	Scientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place.
7.18.297	For example, along the west coast of the United States, two separate sub-species of spotted owls exist.
7.18.298	The northern spotted owl has genetic and phenotypic differences from its close relative: the Mexican spotted owl, which lives in the south (Figure 18.12).
7.18.299	The northern spotted owl and the Mexican spotted owl inhabit geographically separate locations with different climates and ecosystems.
7.18.300	The owl is an example of allopatric speciation.
7.18.301	(credit "northern spotted owl": modification of work by John and Karen Hollingsworth; credit "Mexican spotted owl": modification of work by Bill Radke)
7.18.302	Additionally, scientists have found that the further the distance between two groups that once were the same species, the more likely it is that speciation will occur.
7.18.303	This seems logical because as the distance increases, the various environmental factors would likely have less in common than locations in close proximity.
7.18.304	Consider the two owls: in the north, the climate is cooler than in the south; the types of organisms in each ecosystem differ, as do their behaviors and habits; also, the hunting habits and prey choices of the southern owls vary from the northern owls.
7.18.305	These variances can lead to evolved differences in the owls, and speciation likely will occur.
7.18.306	Adaptive Radiation
7.18.307	In some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each finds a distinct niche or isolated habitat.
7.18.308	Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species.
7.18.309	This is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing the species to radiate into several new ones.
7.18.310	Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms.
7.18.311	The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example of adaptive radiation.
7.18.312	From a single species, called the founder species, numerous species have evolved, including the six shown in Figure 18.13.
7.18.313	The honeycreeper birds illustrate adaptive radiation.
7.18.314	From one original species of bird, multiple others evolved, each with its own distinctive characteristics.
7.18.315	Notice the differences in the species’ beaks in Figure 18.13.
7.18.316	Evolution in response to natural selection based on specific food sources in each new habitat led to evolution of a different beak suited to the specific food source.
7.18.317	The seed-eating bird has a thicker, stronger beak which is suited to break hard nuts.
7.18.318	The nectar-eating birds have long beaks to dip into flowers to reach the nectar.
7.18.319	The insect-eating birds have beaks like swords, appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects.
7.18.320	Darwin’s finches are another example of adaptive radiation in an archipelago.
7.18.321	Sympatric Speciation Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat?
7.18.322	The answer is yes.
7.18.323	The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix “
7.18.324	sym”
7.18.325	means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland.
7.18.326	”
7.18.327	A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied.
7.18.328	One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division.
7.18.329	In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes.
7.18.330	However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.14).
7.18.331	Polyploidy is a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes.
7.18.332	Scientists have identified two main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state.
7.18.333	Reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed.
7.18.334	In some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy (Figure 18.15).
7.18.335	The prefix “auto-
7.18.336	” means “self,
7.18.337	” so the term means multiple chromosomes from one’s own species.
7.18.338	Polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into one cell instead of separating.
7.18.339	Autopolyploidy results when mitosis is not followed by cytokinesis.
7.18.340	For example, if a plant species with 2n = 6 produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid (2n = 6, when they should be n = 3), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have.
7.18.341	These new gametes will be incompatible with the normal gametes produced by this plant species.
7.18.342	However, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number.
7.18.343	In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by forming offspring with 4n called a tetraploid.
7.18.344	These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of this new kind and not those of the ancestral species.
7.18.345	The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an allopolyploid.
7.18.346	The prefix “
7.18.347	allo-
7.18.348	” means “other” (recall from allopatric): therefore, an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine.
7.18.349	Figure 18.16 illustrates one possible way an allopolyploid can form.
7.18.350	Notice how it takes two generations, or two reproductive acts, before the viable fertile hybrid results.
7.18.351	Alloploidy results when two species mate to produce viable offspring.
7.18.352	In the example shown, a normal gamete from one species fuses with a polyploidy gamete from another.
7.18.353	Two matings are necessary to produce viable offspring.
7.18.354	The cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids.
7.18.355	Although polyploidy occurs occasionally in animals, it takes place most commonly in plants.
7.18.356	(Animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations described here are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring.)
7.18.357	Scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy.
7.18.358	With such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error.
7.18.359	Reproductive Isolation
7.18.360	Given enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction: if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating occurred, offspring would be non-viable or infertile.
7.18.361	Many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation, the ability to interbreed, of the two populations.
7.18.362	Reproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways.
7.18.363	Scientists organize them into two groups: prezygotic barriers and postzygotic barriers.
7.18.364	Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg: the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually.
7.18.365	Therefore, a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction.
7.18.366	A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation; this includes organisms
7.18.367	that don’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile.
7.18.368	Some types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely.
7.18.369	Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year, often just annually.
7.18.370	Differences in breeding schedules, called temporal isolation, can act as a form of reproductive isolation.
7.18.371	For example, two species of frogs inhabit the same area, but one reproduces from January to March, whereas the other reproduces from March to May (Figure 18.17).
7.18.372	These two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation.
7.18.373	(a)
7.18.374	Rana aurora breeds earlier in the year than (b) Rana boylii.
7.18.375	In some cases, populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species.
7.18.376	This situation is called habitat isolation.
7.18.377	Reproduction with the parent species ceases, and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent.
7.18.378	For example, a cricket population that was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other.
7.18.379	Over time, the forces of natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift will likely result in the divergence of the two groups (Figure 18.18).
7.18.380	Speciation can occur when two populations occupy different habitats.
7.18.381	The habitats need not be far apart.
7.18.382	The cricket (a) Gryllus pennsylvanicus prefers sandy soil, and the cricket (b)
7.18.383	Gryllus firmus prefers loamy soil.
7.18.384	The two species can live in close proximity, but because of their different soil preferences, they became genetically isolated.
7.18.385	Behavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place.
7.18.386	For example, male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females.
7.18.387	Various species of fireflies display their lights differently.
7.18.388	If a male of one species tried to attract the female of another, she would not recognize the light pattern and would not mate with the male.
7.18.389	Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking place; this is called a gametic barrier.
7.18.390	Similarly, in some cases closely related organisms try to mate, but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together.
7.18.391	For example, damselfly males of different species have differently shaped reproductive organs.
7.18.392	If one species tries to mate with the female of another, their body parts simply do not fit together.
7.18.393	(Figure 18.19).
7.18.394	The shape of the male reproductive organ varies among male damselfly species, and is only compatible with the female of that species.
7.18.395	Reproductive organ incompatibility keeps the species reproductively isolated.
7.18.396	In plants, certain structures aimed to attract one type of pollinator simultaneously prevent a different pollinator from accessing the pollen.
7.18.397	The tunnel through which an animal must access nectar can vary widely in length and diameter, which prevents the plant from being cross-pollinated with a different species (Figure 18.20).
7.18.398	Some flowers have evolved to attract certain pollinators.
7.18.399	The (a) wide foxglove flower is adapted for pollination by bees, while the (b) long, tube-shaped trumpet creeper flower is adapted for pollination by humming birds.
7.18.400	When fertilization takes place and a zygote forms, postzygotic barriers can prevent reproduction.
7.18.401	Hybrid individuals in many cases cannot form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages.
7.18.402	This is called hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable.
7.18.403	In another postzygotic situation, reproduction leads to the birth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own; this is called hybrid sterility.
7.18.404	Habitat Influence on Speciation Sympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy.
7.18.405	For example, consider a species of fish that lives in a lake.
7.18.406	As the population grows, competition for food also grows.
7.18.407	Under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these fish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that was unused by the other fish.
7.18.408	What if this new food source was found at a different depth of the lake?
7.18.409	Over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact more with each other than the other fish; therefore, they would breed together as well.
7.18.410	Offspring of these fish would likely behave as their parents: feeding and living in the same area and keeping separate from the original population.
7.18.411	If this group of fish continued to remain separate from the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic differences accumulated between them.
7.18.412	This scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation.
7.18.413	One such place is Lake Victoria in Africa, famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish.
7.18.414	Researchers have found hundreds of sympatric speciation events in these fish, which have not only happened in great number, but also over a short period of time.
7.18.415	Figure 18.21 shows this type of speciation among a cichlid fish population in Nicaragua.
7.18.416	In this locale, two types of cichlids live in the same geographic location but have come to have different morphologies that allow them to eat various food sources.
7.18.417	Cichlid fish from Lake Apoyeque, Nicaragua, show evidence of sympatric speciation.
7.18.418	Lake Apoyeque, a crater lake, is 1800 years old, but genetic evidence indicates that the lake was populated only 100 years ago by a single population of cichlid fish.
7.18.419	Nevertheless, two populations with distinct morphologies and diets now exist in the lake, and scientists believe these populations may be in an early stage of speciation.
7.18.420	Reconnection and Rates of Speciation Speciation occurs over a span of evolutionary time, so when a new species arises, there is a transition period during which the closely related species continue to interact.
7.18.421	Reconnection
7.18.422	After speciation, two species may recombine or even continue interacting indefinitely.
7.18.423	Individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with.
7.18.424	An area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids, is called a hybrid zone.
7.18.425	Over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers (Figure 18.22).
7.18.426	If the hybrids are less fit than the parents, reinforcement of speciation occurs, and the species continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring.
7.18.427	If reproductive barriers weaken, fusion occurs and the two species become one.
7.18.428	Barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and reproductive: stability may occur and hybridization continues.
7.18.429	Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same.
7.18.430	Usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such reproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process called reinforcement.
7.18.431	This term is used because the low success of the hybrids reinforces the original speciation.
7.18.432	If the hybrids are as fit or more fit than the parents, the two species may fuse back into one species (Figure 18.23).
7.18.433	Scientists have also observed that sometimes two species will remain separate but also continue to interact to produce some hybrid individuals; this is classified as stability because no real net change is taking place.
7.18.434	Varying Rates of Speciation Scientists around the world study speciation, documenting observations both of living organisms and those found in the fossil record.
7.18.435	As their ideas take shape and as research reveals new details about how life evolves, they develop models to help explain rates of speciation.
7.18.436	In terms of how quickly speciation occurs, two patterns are currently observed: gradual speciation model and punctuated equilibrium model.
7.18.437	In the gradual speciation model, species diverge gradually over time in small steps.
7.18.438	In the punctuated equilibrium model, a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward (Figure 18.23).
7.18.439	This early change model is called punctuated equilibrium, because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward.
7.18.440	While punctuated equilibrium suggests a faster tempo, it does not necessarily exclude gradualism.
7.18.441	The primary influencing factor on changes in speciation rate is environmental conditions.
7.18.442	Under some conditions, selection occurs quickly or radically.
7.18.443	Consider a species of snails that had been living with the same basic form for many thousands of years.
7.18.444	Layers of their fossils would appear similar for a long time.
7.18.445	When a change in the environment takes place—such as a drop in the water level—a small number of organisms are separated from the rest in a brief period of time, essentially forming one large and one tiny population.
7.18.446	The tiny population faces new environmental conditions.
7.18.447	Because its gene pool quickly became so small, any variation that surfaces and that aids in surviving the new conditions becomes the predominant form.
7.19.0	THE EVOLUTION OF POPULATIONS Living things may be single-celled or complex, multicellular organisms.
7.19.1	They may be plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, or archaea.
7.19.2	This diversity results from evolution.
7.19.3	Introduction
7.19.4	All life on Earth is related.
7.19.5	Evolutionary theory states that humans, beetles, plants, and bacteria all share a common ancestor, but that millions of years of evolution have shaped each of these organisms into the forms seen today.
7.19.6	Scientists consider evolution a key concept to understanding life.
7.19.7	Natural selection is one of the most dominant evolutionary forces.
7.19.8	Natural selection acts to promote traits and behaviors that increase an organism
7.19.9	’s chances of survival and reproduction, while eliminating those traits and behaviors that are to the organism’s detriment.
7.19.10	But natural selection can only, as its name implies, select—it cannot create.
7.19.11	The introduction of novel traits and behaviors falls on the shoulders of another evolutionary force—mutation.
7.19.12	Mutation and other sources of variation among individuals, as well as the evolutionary forces that act upon them, alter populations and species.
7.19.13	This combination of processes has led to the world of life we see today.
7.19.14	Population Evolution
7.19.15	The mechanisms of inheritance, or genetics, were not understood at the time Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were developing their idea of natural selection.
7.19.16	This lack of understanding was a stumbling block to understanding many aspects of evolution.
7.19.17	In fact, the predominant (and incorrect) genetic theory of the time, blending inheritance, made it difficult to understand how natural selection might operate.
7.19.18	Darwin and Wallace were unaware of the genetics work by Austrian monk Gregor Mendel, which was published in 1866, not long after publication of Darwin's book, On the Origin of Species.
7.19.19	Mendel’s work was rediscovered in the early twentieth century at which time geneticists were rapidly coming to an understanding of the basics of inheritance.
7.19.20	Initially, the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur.
7.19.21	But over the next few decades genetics and evolution were integrated in what became known as the modern synthesis—the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today.
7.19.22	In sum, the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes, such as natural selection, can affect a population’s genetic makeup, and, in turn, how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species.
7.19.23	The theory also connects this change of a population over time, called microevolution, with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters, called macroevolution.
7.19.24	Evolution and Flu Vaccines
7.19.25	Every fall, the media starts reporting on flu vaccinations and potential outbreaks.
7.19.26	Scientists, health experts, and institutions determine recommendations for different parts of the population, predict optimal production and inoculation schedules, create vaccines, and set up clinics to provide inoculations.
7.19.27	You may think of the annual flu shot as a lot of media hype, an important health protection, or just a briefly uncomfortable prick in your arm.
7.19.28	But do you think of it in terms of evolution?
7.19.29	The media hype of annual flu shots is scientifically grounded in our understanding of evolution.
7.19.30	Each year, scientists across the globe strive to predict the flu strains that they anticipate being most widespread and harmful in the coming year.
7.19.31	This knowledge is based in how flu strains have evolved over time and over the past few flu seasons.
7.19.32	Scientists then work to create the most effective vaccine to combat those selected strains.
7.19.33	Hundreds of millions of doses are produced in a short period in order to provide vaccinations to key populations at the optimal time.
7.19.34	Because viruses, like the flu, evolve very quickly (especially in evolutionary time), this poses quite a challenge.
7.19.35	Viruses mutate and replicate at a fast rate, so the vaccine developed to protect against last year’s flu strain may not provide the protection needed against the coming year’s strain.
7.19.36	Evolution of these viruses means continued adaptions to ensure survival, including adaptations to survive previous vaccines.
7.19.37	Population Genetics Recall that a gene for a particular character may have several alleles, or variants, that code for different traits associated with that character.
7.19.38	For example, in the ABO blood type system in humans, three alleles determine the particular blood-type protein on the surface of red blood cells.
7.19.39	Each individual in a population of diploid organisms can only carry two alleles for a particular gene, but more than two may be present in the individuals that make up the population.
7.19.40	Mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring.
7.19.41	In the early twentieth century, biologists in a field of study known as population genetics began to study how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies.
7.19.42	The allele frequency (or gene frequency) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population.
7.19.43	Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms, but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change.
7.19.44	In population genetics, the term evolution is defined as a change in the frequency of an allele in a population.
7.19.45	Using the ABO blood type system as an example, the frequency of one of the alleles, IA, is the number of copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the ABO gene in the population.
7.19.46	For example, a study in Jordan [1] found a frequency of IA to be 26.1 percent.
7.19.47	The IB and I0 alleles made up 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent.
7.19.48	A change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population.
7.19.49	The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become more widespread than others during the process of natural selection.
7.19.50	Natural selection can alter the population’s genetic makeup; for example, if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more offspring.
7.19.51	Because many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more offspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle.
7.19.52	Over time, the allele will spread throughout the population.
7.19.53	Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool.
7.19.54	The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population.
7.19.55	Sometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies.
7.19.56	This phenomenon is called genetic drift.
7.19.57	Natural selection and genetic drift usually occur simultaneously in populations and are not isolated events.
7.19.58	It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence.
7.19.59	An event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is called the founder effect.
7.19.60	Natural selection, random drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population.
7.19.61	Hardy-Weinberg Principle of Equilibrium
7.19.62	In the early twentieth century, English mathematician Godfrey Hardy and German physician Wilhelm Weinberg stated the principle of equilibrium to describe the genetic makeup of a population.
7.19.63	The theory, which later became known as the Hardy-Weinberg principle of equilibrium, states that a population’s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable— unless some kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change.
7.19.64	The Hardy-Weinberg principle assumes conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or selective pressure for or against genotype, plus an infinite population; while no population can satisfy those conditions, the principle offers a useful model against which to compare real population changes.
7.19.65	Working under this theory, population geneticists represent different alleles as different variables in their mathematical models.
7.19.66	The variable p, for example, often represents the frequency of a particular allele, say Y for the trait of yellow in Mendel’s peas, while the variable q represents the frequency of y alleles that confer the color green.
7.19.67	If these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population, p + q = 1.
7.19.68	In other words, all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population.
7.19.69	But what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes, known as the population’s genetic structure, from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes.
7.19.70	If the phenotype is observed, only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known; the calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes.
7.19.71	Since each individual carries two alleles per gene, if the allele frequencies (p and q) are known, predicting the frequencies of these genotypes is a simple mathematical calculation to determine the probability of getting these genotypes if two alleles are drawn at random from the gene pool.
7.19.72	So in the above scenario, an individual pea plant could be pp (YY), and thus produce yellow peas;
7.19.73	pq (Yy), also yellow; or qq (yy), and thus producing green peas (Figure 19.2).
7.19.74	In other words, the frequency of pp individuals is simply p2; the frequency of pq individuals is 2pq; and the frequency of qq individuals is q2.
7.19.75	And, again, if p and q are the only two possible alleles for a given trait in the population, these genotypes frequencies will sum to one:
7.19.76	p2 + 2pq + q2
7.19.77	= 1.
7.19.78	When populations are in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the allelic frequency is stable from generation to generation and the distribution of alleles can be determined from the Hardy-Weinberg equation.
7.19.79	If the allelic frequency measured in the field differs from the predicted value, scientists can make inferences about what evolutionary forces are at play.
7.19.80	In plants, violet flower color (V) is dominant over white (v).
7.19.81	If p = 0.8 and q = 0.2 in a population of 500 plants, how many individuals would you expect to be homozygous dominant (VV), heterozygous (Vv), and homozygous recessive (vv)?
7.19.82	How many plants would you expect to have violet flowers, and how many would have white flowers?
7.19.83	In theory, if a population is at equilibrium—that is, there are no evolutionary forces acting upon it
7.19.84	—generation after generation would have the same gene pool and genetic structure, and these equations would all hold true all of the time.
7.19.85	Of course, even Hardy and Weinberg recognized that no natural population is immune to evolution.
7.19.86	Populations in nature are constantly changing in genetic makeup due to drift, mutation, possibly migration, and selection.
7.19.87	As a result, the only way to determine the exact distribution of phenotypes in a population is to go out and count them.
7.19.88	But the Hardy-Weinberg principle gives scientists a mathematical baseline of a non-evolving population to which they can compare evolving populations and thereby infer what evolutionary forces might be at play.
7.19.89	If the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate from the value expected from the Hardy-Weinberg equation, then the population is evolving.
7.19.90	Individuals of a population often display different phenotypes, or express different alleles of a particular gene, referred to as polymorphisms.
7.19.91	Populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic.
7.19.92	The distribution of phenotypes among individuals, known as the population variation, is influenced by a number of factors, including the population’s genetic structure and the environment (Figure 19.3).
7.19.93	Understanding the sources of a phenotypic variation in a population is important for determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures.
7.19.94	Population Genetics Genetic Variance Natural selection and some of the other evolutionary forces can only act on heritable traits, namely an organism’s genetic code.
7.19.95	Because alleles are passed from parent to offspring, those that confer beneficial traits or behaviors may be selected for, while deleterious alleles may be selected against.
7.19.96	Acquired traits, for the most part, are not heritable.
7.19.97	For example, if an athlete works out in the gym every day, building up muscle strength, the athlete’s offspring will not necessarily grow up to be a body builder.
7.19.98	If there is a genetic basis for the ability to run fast, on the other hand, this may be passed to a child.
7.19.99	Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences, or genetic variance, among individuals in a population.
7.19.100	The greater the hereditability of a population’s phenotypic variation, the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation.
7.19.101	The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance.
7.19.102	When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a population’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can.
7.19.103	This also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding, the mating of closely related individuals, which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease.
7.19.104	For example, a disease that is caused by a rare, recessive allele might exist in a population, but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele.
7.19.105	Because the allele is rare in a normal, healthy population with unrestricted habitat, the chance that two carriers will mate is low, and even then, only 25 percent of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from both parents.
7.19.106	While it is likely to happen at some point, it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population, and as a result, the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool.
7.19.107	However, if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other, this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression.
7.19.108	Changes in allele frequencies that are identified in a population can shed light on how it is evolving.
7.19.109	In addition to natural selection, there are other evolutionary forces that could be in play: genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, nonrandom mating, and environmental variances.
7.19.110	Genetic Drift
7.19.111	The theory of natural selection stems from the observation that some individuals in a population are more likely to survive longer and have more offspring than others; thus, they will pass on more of their genes to the next generation.
7.19.112	A big, powerful male gorilla, for example, is much more likely than a smaller, weaker one to become the population’s silverback, the pack’s leader who mates far more than the other males of the group.
7.19.113	The pack leader will father more offspring, who share half of his genes, and are likely to also grow bigger and stronger like their father.
7.19.114	Over time, the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population, and the population will, as a result, grow larger on average.
7.19.115	That is, this would occur if this particular selection pressure, or driving selective force, were the only one acting on the population.
7.19.116	In other examples, better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure.
7.19.117	Another way a population’s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift (Figure 19.4), which is simply the effect of chance.
7.19.118	By chance, some individuals will have more offspring than others—not due to an advantage conferred by some genetically-encoded trait, but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time (when the receptive female walked by) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (when a fox was hunting).
7.19.119	Genetic drift in a population can lead to the elimination of an allele from a population by chance.
7.19.120	In this example, rabbits with the brown coat color allele (B) are dominant over rabbits with the white coat color allele (b).
7.19.121	In the first generation, the two alleles occur with equal frequency in the population, resulting in p and q values of .5.
7.19.122	Only half of the individuals reproduce, resulting in a second generation with p and q values of .7 and .3, respectively.
7.19.123	Only two individuals in the second generation reproduce, and by chance these individuals are homozygous dominant for brown coat color.
7.19.124	As a result, in the third generation the recessive b allele is lost.
7.19.125	Small populations are more susceptible to the forces of genetic drift.
7.19.126	Large populations, on the other hand, are buffered against the effects of chance.
7.19.127	If one individual of a population of 10 individuals happens to die at a young age before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—1/10 of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost.
7.19.128	In a population of 100, that’s only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it is much less impactful on the population’s genetic structure.
7.19.129	Genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events, such as a natural disaster that kills—at random—a large portion of the population.
7.19.130	Known as the bottleneck effect, it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out (Figure 19.5).
7.19.131	In one fell swoop, the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population, which may be very different from the pre-disaster population.
7.19.132	population leaves to start a new population in a new location or if a population gets divided by a physical barrier of some kind.
7.19.133	In this situation, those individuals are unlikely to be representative of the entire population, which results in the founder effect.
7.19.134	The founder effect occurs when the genetic structure changes to match that of the new population’s founding fathers and mothers.
7.19.135	The founder effect is believed to have been a key factor in the genetic history of the Afrikaner population of Dutch settlers in South Africa, as evidenced by mutations that are common in Afrikaners but rare in most other populations.
7.19.136	This is likely due to the fact that a higher-than-normal proportion of the founding colonists carried these mutations.
7.19.137	As a result, the population expresses unusually high incidences of Huntington’s disease (HD) and Fanconi anemia (FA), a genetic disorder known to cause blood marrow and congenital abnormalities—even cancer.
7.19.138	[2] Testing the Bottleneck Effect Question: How do natural disasters affect the genetic structure of a population?
7.19.139	Background: When much of a population is suddenly wiped out by an earthquake or hurricane, the individuals that survive the event are usually a random sampling of the original group.
7.19.140	As a result, the genetic makeup of the population can change dramatically.
7.19.141	This phenomenon is known as the bottleneck effect.
7.19.142	Hypothesis:
7.19.143	Repeated natural disasters will yield different population genetic structures; therefore, each time this experiment is run, the results will vary.
7.19.144	Test the hypothesis
7.19.145	: Count out the original population using different colored beads.
7.19.146	For example, red, blue, and yellow beads might represent red, blue, and yellow individuals.
7.19.147	After recording the number of each individual in the original population, place them all in a bottle with a narrow neck that will only allow a few beads out at a time.
7.19.148	Then, pour 1/3 of the bottle’s contents into a bowl.
7.19.149	This represents the surviving individuals after a natural disaster kills a majority of the population.
7.19.150	Count the number of the different colored beads in the bowl, and record it.
7.19.151	Then, place all of the beads back in the bottle and repeat the experiment four more times.
7.19.152	Analyze the data: Compare the five populations that resulted from the experiment.
7.19.153	Do the populations all contain the same number of different colored beads, or do they vary?
7.19.154	Remember, these populations all came from the same exact parent population.
7.19.155	Form a conclusion: Most likely, the five resulting populations will differ quite dramatically.
7.19.156	This is because natural disasters are not selective—they kill and spare individuals at random.
7.19.157	Now think about how this might affect a real population.
7.19.158	What happens when a hurricane hits the Mississippi Gulf Coast?
7.19.159	How do the seabirds that live on the beach fare?
7.19.160	Gene Flow
7.19.161	Another important evolutionary force is gene flow: the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of individuals or gametes (Figure 19.6).
7.19.162	While some populations are fairly stable, others experience more flux.
7.19.163	Many plants, for example, send their pollen far and wide, by wind or by bird, to pollinate other populations of the same species some distance away.
7.19.164	Even a population that may initially appear to be stable, such as a pride of lions, can experience its fair share of immigration and emigration as developing males leave their mothers to seek out a new pride with genetically unrelated females.
7.19.165	This variable flow of individuals in and out of the group not only changes the gene structure of the population, but it can also introduce new genetic variation to populations in different geological locations and habitats.
7.19.166	Mutation Mutations are changes to an organism’s DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations.
7.19.167	Species evolve because of the accumulation of mutations that occur over time.
7.19.168	The appearance of new mutations is the most common way to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance.
7.19.169	Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated from the population by natural selection.
7.19.170	Others are beneficial and will spread through the population.
7.19.171	Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce.
7.19.172	Some mutations do not do anything and can linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome.
7.19.173	Some can have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting phenotype.
7.19.174	Nonrandom Mating
7.19.175	If individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers, the result can be a changing population.
7.19.176	There are many reasons nonrandom mating occurs.
7.19.177	One reason is simple mate choice; for example, female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger, brighter tails.
7.19.178	Traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection.
7.19.179	One common form of mate choice, called assortative mating, is an individual’s preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves.
7.19.180	Another cause of nonrandom mating is physical location.
7.19.181	This is especially true in large populations spread over large geographic distances where not all individuals will have equal access to one another.
7.19.182	Some might be miles apart through woods or over rough terrain, while others might live immediately nearby.
7.19.183	Environmental Variance Genes are not the only players involved in determining population variation.
7.19.184	Phenotypes are also influenced by other factors, such as the environment (Figure 19.7).
7.19.185	A beachgoer is likely to have darker skin than a city dweller, for example, due to regular exposure to the sun, an environmental factor.
7.19.186	Some major characteristics, such as gender, are determined by the environment for some species.
7.19.187	For example, some turtles and other reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD).
7.19.188	TSD means that individuals develop into males if their eggs are incubated within a certain temperature range, or females at a different temperature range.
7.19.189	The sex of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is determined by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated.
7.19.190	Eggs incubated at 30°C produce females, and eggs incubated at 33°C produce males.
7.19.191	(credit: Steve Hillebrand, USFWS)
7.19.192	Geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations.
7.19.193	Such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant.
7.19.194	One type of geographic variation, called a cline, can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient.
7.19.195	Species of warmblooded animals, for example, tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth’s poles, allowing them to better conserve heat.
7.19.196	This is considered a latitudinal cline.
7.19.197	Alternatively, flowering plants tend to bloom at different times depending on where they are along the slope of a mountain, known as an altitudinal cline.
7.19.198	If there is gene flow between the populations, the individuals will likely show gradual differences in phenotype along the cline.
7.19.199	Restricted gene flow, on the other hand, can lead to abrupt differences, even speciation.
7.19.200	Adaptive Evolution Natural selection only acts on the population’s heritable traits: selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population, while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency—a process known as adaptive evolution.
7.19.201	Natural selection does not act on individual alleles, however, but on entire organisms.
7.19.202	An individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that, for example, increases the ability to reproduce (fecundity), but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease, that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age.
7.19.203	Natural selection acts at the level of the individual; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation, known as an organism’s evolutionary (Darwinian) fitness.
7.19.204	Fitness is often quantifiable and is measured by scientists in the field.
7.19.205	However, it is not the absolute fitness of an individual that counts, but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population.
7.19.206	This concept, called relative fitness, allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation, and thus, how the population might evolve.
7.19.207	There are several ways selection can affect population variation: stabilizing selection, directional selection, diversifying selection, frequency-dependent selection, and sexual selection.
7.19.208	As natural selection influences the allele frequencies in a population, individuals can either become more or less genetically similar and the phenotypes displayed can become more similar or more disparate.
7.19.209	Stabilizing Selection
7.19.210	If natural selection favors an average phenotype, selecting against extreme variation, the population will undergo stabilizing selection (Figure 19.8).
7.19.211	In a population of mice that live in the woods, for example, natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators.
7.19.212	Assuming the ground is a fairly consistent shade of brown, those mice whose fur is most closely matched to that color will be most likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes for their brown coat.
7.19.213	Mice that carry alleles that make them a bit lighter or
7.19.214	a bit darker will stand out against the ground and be more likely to fall victim to predation.
7.19.215	As a result of this selection, the population’s genetic variance will decrease.
7.19.216	Directional Selection
7.19.217	When the environment changes, populations will often undergo directional selection (Figure 19.8), which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation.
7.19.218	A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England.
7.19.219	Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the moths were predominately light in color, which allowed them to blend in with the light-colored trees and lichens in their environment.
7.19.220	But as soot began spewing from factories, the trees became darkened, and the light-colored moths became easier for predatory birds to spot.
7.19.221	Over time, the frequency of the melanic form of the moth increased because they had a higher survival rate in habitats affected by air pollution because their darker coloration blended with the sooty trees.
7.19.222	Similarly, the hypothetical mouse population may evolve to take on a different coloration if something were to cause the forest floor where they live to change color.
7.19.223	The result of this type of selection is a shift in the population’s genetic variance toward the new, fit phenotype.
7.19.224	Diversifying Selection
7.19.225	Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection, while the intermediate phenotypes are, on average, less fit.
7.19.226	Known as diversifying selection (Figure 19.8), this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms.
7.19.227	Large, dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force, while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male’s territory.
7.19.228	In this case, both the alpha males and the “sneaking” males will be selected for, but medium-sized males, which can’t overtake the alpha males and are too big to sneak copulations, are selected against.
7.19.229	Diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes favor individuals on either end of the phenotypic spectrum.
7.19.230	Imagine a population of mice living at the beach where there is light-colored sand interspersed with patches of tall grass.
7.19.231	In this scenario, light-colored mice that blend in with the sand would be favored, as well as dark-colored mice that can hide in the grass.
7.19.232	Medium-colored mice, on the other hand, would not blend in with either the grass or the sand, and would thus be more likely to be eaten by predators.
7.19.233	The result of this type of selection is increased genetic variance as the population becomes more diverse.
7.19.234	Different types of natural selection can impact the distribution of phenotypes within a population.
7.19.235	In (a) stabilizing selection, an average phenotype is favored.
7.19.236	In (b) directional selection, a change in the environment shifts the spectrum of phenotypes observed.
7.19.237	In (c) diversifying selection, two or more extreme phenotypes are selected for, while the average phenotype is selected against.
7.19.238	Frequency-dependent Selection Another type of selection, called frequency-dependent selection, favors phenotypes that are either common (positive frequency-dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependent selection).
7.19.239	An interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the Pacific Northwest.
7.19.240	Male common side-blotched lizards come in three throat-color patterns: orange, blue, and yellow.
7.19.241	Each of these forms has a different reproductive strategy: orange males are the strongest and can fight other males for access to their females; blue males are medium-sized and form strong pair bonds with their mates; and yellow males (Figure 19.9) are the smallest, and look a bit like females, which allows them to sneak copulations.
7.19.242	Like a game of rock-paper-scissors, orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange in the competition for females.
7.19.243	That is, the big, strong orange males can fight off the blue males to mate with the blue’s pairbonded females, the blue males are successful at guarding their mates against yellow sneaker males, and the yellow males can sneak copulations from the potential mates of the large, polygynous orange males.
7.19.244	A yellow-throated side-blotched lizard is smaller than either the blue-throated or orange-throated males and appears a bit like the females of the species, allowing it to sneak copulations.
7.19.245	In this scenario, orange males will be favored by natural selection when the population is dominated by blue males, blue males will thrive when the population is mostly yellow males, and yellow males will be selected for when orange males are the most populous.
7.19.246	As a result, populations of side-blotched lizards cycle in the distribution of these phenotypes—in one generation, orange might be predominant, and then yellow males will begin to rise in frequency.
7.19.247	Once yellow males make up a majority of the population, blue males will be selected for.
7.19.248	Finally, when blue males become common, orange males will once again be favored.
7.19.249	Negative frequency-dependent selection serves to increase the population’s genetic variance by selecting for rare phenotypes, whereas positive frequency-dependent selection usually decreases genetic variance by selecting for common phenotypes.
7.19.250	Sexual Selection Males and females of certain species are often quite different from one another in ways beyond the reproductive organs.
7.19.251	Males are often larger, for example, and display many elaborate colors and adornments, like the peacock’s tail, while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration.
7.19.252	Such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms (Figure 19.10), which arise from the fact that in many populations, particularly animal populations, there is more variance in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females.
7.19.253	That is, some males—often the bigger, stronger, or more decorated males—get the vast majority of the total matings, while others receive none.
7.19.254	This can occur because the males are better at fighting off other males, or because females will choose to mate with the bigger or more decorated males.
7.19.255	In either case, this variation in reproductive success generates a strong selection pressure among males to get those matings, resulting in the evolution of bigger body size and elaborate ornaments to get the females’ attention.
7.19.256	Females, on the other hand, tend to get a handful of selected matings; therefore, they are more likely to select more desirable males.
7.19.257	Sexual dimorphism varies widely among species, of course, and some species are even sex-role reversed.
7.19.258	In such cases, females tend to have a greater variance in their reproductive success than males and are correspondingly selected for the bigger body size and elaborate traits usually characteristic of males.
7.19.259	Sexual dimorphism is observed in (a) peacocks and peahens, (b) Argiope appensa spiders (the female spider is the large one), and in (c) wood ducks The selection pressures on males and females to obtain matings is known as sexual selection; it can result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics that do not benefit the individual’s likelihood of survival but help to maximize its reproductive success.
7.19.260	Sexual selection can be so strong that it selects for traits that are actually detrimental to the individual’s survival.
7.19.261	Think, once again, about the peacock’s tail.
7.19.262	While it is beautiful and the male with the largest, most colorful tail is more likely to win the female, it is not the most practical appendage.
7.19.263	In addition to being more visible to predators, it makes the males slower in their attempted escapes.
7.19.264	There is some evidence that this risk, in fact, is why females like the big tails in the first place.
7.19.265	The speculation is that large tails carry risk, and only the best males survive that risk: the bigger the tail, the more fit the male.
7.19.266	This idea is known as the handicap principle.
7.19.267	The good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease.
7.19.268	Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority, which they will then pass on to their offspring.
7.19.269	Though it might be argued that females should not be picky because it will likely reduce their number of offspring, if better males father more fit offspring, it may be beneficial.
7.19.270	Fewer, healthier offspring may increase the chances of survival more than many, weaker offspring.
7.19.271	thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates— males that will pass the best genes to their offspring.
7.19.272	No Perfect Organism Natural selection is a driving force in evolution and can generate populations that are better adapted to survive and successfully reproduce in their environments.
7.19.273	But natural selection cannot produce the perfect organism.
7.19.274	Natural selection can only select on existing variation in the population; it does not create anything from scratch.
7.19.275	Thus, it is limited by a population’s existing genetic variance and whatever new alleles arise through mutation and gene flow.
7.19.276	Natural selection is also limited because it works at the level of individuals, not alleles, and some alleles are linked due to their physical proximity in the genome, making them more likely to be passed on together (linkage disequilibrium).
7.19.277	Any given individual may carry some beneficial alleles and some unfavorable alleles.
7.19.278	It is the net effect of these alleles, or the organism’s fitness, upon which natural selection can act.
7.19.279	As a result, good alleles can be lost if they are carried by individuals that also have several overwhelmingly bad alleles; likewise, bad alleles can be kept if they are carried by individuals that have enough good alleles to result in an overall fitness benefit.
7.19.280	Furthermore, natural selection can be constrained by the relationships between different polymorphisms.
7.19.281	One morph may confer a higher fitness than another, but may not increase in frequency due to the fact that going from the less beneficial to the more beneficial trait would require going through a less beneficial phenotype.
7.19.282	Think back to the mice that live at the beach.
7.19.283	Some are light-colored and blend in with the sand, while others are dark and blend in with the patches of grass.
7.19.284	The dark-colored mice may be, overall, more fit than the light-colored mice, and at first glance, one might expect the lightcolored mice be selected for a darker coloration.
7.19.285	But remember that the intermediate phenotype, a medium-colored coat, is very bad for the mice
7.19.286	—they cannot blend in with either the sand or the grass and are more likely to be eaten by predators.
7.19.287	As a result, the light-colored mice would not be selected for a dark coloration because those individuals that began moving in that direction (began being selected for a darker coat) would be less fit than those that stayed light.
7.19.288	Finally, it is important to understand that not all evolution is adaptive.
7.19.289	While natural selection selects the fittest individuals and often results in a more fit population overall, other forces of evolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often do the opposite: introducing deleterious alleles to the population’s gene pool.
7.19.290	Evolution has no purpose—it is not changing a population into a preconceived ideal.
7.19.291	It is simply the sum of the various forces described in this chapter and how they influence the genetic and phenotypic variance of a population.
7.20.0	PHYLOGENIES AND THE HISTORY OF LIFE
7.20.1	The life of a bee is very different from the life of a flower, but the two organisms are related.
7.20.2	Both are members the domain Eukarya and have cells containing many similar organelles, genes, and proteins.
7.20.3	Introduction
7.20.4	This bee and Echinacea flower (Figure 20.1) could not look more different, yet they are related, as are all living organisms on Earth.
7.20.5	By following pathways of similarities and changes—both visible and genetic—scientists seek to map the evolutionary past of how life developed from single-celled organisms to the tremendous collection of creatures that have germinated, crawled, floated, swam, flown, and walked on this planet.
7.20.6	Organizing Life on Earth In scientific terms, the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms is called its phylogeny.
7.20.7	A phylogeny describes the relationships of an organism, such as from which organisms it is thought to have evolved, to which species it is most closely related, and so forth.
7.20.8	Phylogenetic relationships provide information on shared ancestry but not necessarily on how organisms are similar or different.
7.20.9	Phylogenetic Trees Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms.
7.20.10	A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms.
7.20.11	Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships.
7.20.12	In other words, a “tree of life” can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms (Figure 20.2).
7.20.13	Unlike a taxonomic classification diagram, a phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history.
7.20.14	Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor.
7.20.15	Scientists call such trees rooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate.
7.20.16	Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains— Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya—diverge from a single point and branch off.
7.20.17	The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms.
7.20.18	Unrooted trees don’t show a common ancestor but do show relationships among species.
7.20.19	Both of these phylogenetic trees shows the relationship of the three domains of life—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya—but the (a) rooted tree attempts to identify when various species diverged from a common ancestor while the (b) unrooted tree does not.
7.20.20	(credit a: modification of work by Eric Gaba)
7.20.21	In a rooted tree, the branching indicates evolutionary relationships (Figure 20.3).
7.20.22	The point where a split occurs, called a branch point, represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one.
7.20.23	A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon.
7.20.24	When two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are called sister taxa.
7.20.25	A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships.
7.20.26	It is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor, it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other.
7.20.27	Organisms in two taxa may have split apart at a specific branch point, but neither taxa gave rise to the other.
7.20.28	The root of a phylogenetic tree indicates that an ancestral lineage gave rise to all organisms on the tree.
7.20.29	A branch point indicates where two lineages diverged.
7.20.30	A lineage that evolved early and remains unbranched is a basal taxon.
7.20.31	When two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are sister taxa.
7.20.32	A branch with more than two lineages is a polytomy.
7.20.33	The diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history.
7.20.34	The pathway can be traced from the origin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points.
7.20.35	Also, by starting with a single species and tracing back towards the "trunk" of the tree, one can discover that species' ancestors, as well as where lineages share a common ancestry.
7.20.36	In addition, the tree can be used to study entire groups of organisms.
7.20.37	Another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information.
7.20.38	For example, if a branch point was rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because the evolution of each taxon from the branch point was independent of the other.
7.20.39	Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these disciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the “tree of life.
7.20.40	”
7.20.41	Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics.
7.20.42	Data may be collected from fossils, from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism, and by DNA analysis.
7.20.43	By combining data from many sources, scientists can put together the phylogeny of an organism; since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, they will continue to change as new types of life are discovered and new information is learned.
7.20.44	Limitations of Phylogenetic Trees
7.20.45	It may be easy to assume that more closely related organisms look more alike, and while this is often the case, it is not always true.
7.20.46	If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings or after the evolution of a major new adaptation, it is possible for the two groups to appear more different than other groups that are not as closely related.
7.20.47	For example, the phylogenetic tree in Figure 20.4 shows that lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs, whereas frogs do not; yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and rabbits.
7.20.48	This ladder-like phylogenetic tree of vertebrates is rooted by an organism that lacked a vertebral column.
7.20.49	At each branch point, organisms with different characters are placed in different groups based on the characteristics they share.
7.20.50	Another aspect of phylogenetic trees is that, unless otherwise indicated, the branches do not account for length of time, only the evolutionary order.
7.20.51	In other words, the length of a branch does not typically mean more time passed, nor does a short branch mean less time passed— unless specified on the diagram.
7.20.52	For example, in Figure 20.4, the tree does not indicate how much time passed between the evolution of amniotic eggs and hair.
7.20.53	What the tree does show is the order in which things took place.
7.20.54	Again using Figure 20.4, the tree shows that the oldest trait is the vertebral column, followed by hinged jaws, and so forth.
7.20.55	Remember that any phylogenetic tree is a part of the greater whole, and like a real tree, it does not grow in only one direction after a new branch develops.
7.20.56	So, for the organisms in Figure 20.4, just because a vertebral column evolved does not mean that invertebrate evolution ceased, it only means that a new branch formed.
7.20.57	Also, groups that are not closely related, but evolve under similar conditions, may appear more phenotypically similar to each other than to a close relative.
7.20.58	The Levels of Classification Taxonomy (which literally means “arrangement law”) is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings.
7.20.59	Think about how a grocery store is organized.
7.20.60	One large space is divided into departments, such as produce, dairy, and meats.
7.20.61	Then each department further divides into aisles, then each aisle into categories and brands, and then finally a single product.
7.20.62	This organization from larger to smaller, more specific categories is called a hierarchical system.
7.20.63	The taxonomic classification system (also called the Linnaean system after its inventor, Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician) uses a hierarchical model.
7.20.64	Moving from the point of origin, the groups become more specific, until one branch ends as a single species.
7.20.65	For example, after the common beginning of all life, scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
7.20.66	Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom.
7.20.67	After kingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species (Figure 20.5).
7.20.68	The taxonomic classification system uses a hierarchical model to organize living organisms into increasingly specific categories.
7.20.69	The common dog, Canis lupus familiaris, is a subspecies of Canis lupus, which also includes the wolf and dingo.
7.20.70	(credit “dog
7.20.71	”:
7.20.72	modification of work by Janneke Vreugdenhil)
7.20.73	The kingdom Animalia stems from the Eukarya domain.
7.20.74	For the common dog, the classification levels would be as shown in Figure 20.5.
7.20.75	Therefore, the full name of an organism technically has eight terms.
7.20.76	For the dog, it is: Eukarya, Animalia, Chordata, Mammalia, Carnivora, Canidae, Canis, and lupus.
7.20.77	Notice that each name is capitalized except for species, and the genus and species names are italicized.
7.20.78	Scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species, which is its two-word scientific name, in what is called binomial nomenclature.
7.20.79	Therefore, the scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus.
7.20.80	The name at each level is also called a taxon.
7.20.81	In other words, dogs are in order Carnivora.
7.20.82	Carnivora is the name of the taxon at the order level; Canidae is the taxon at the family level, and so forth.
7.20.83	Organisms also have a common name that people typically use, in this case, dog.
7.20.84	Note that the dog is additionally a subspecies: the “familiaris” in Canis lupus familiaris.
7.20.85	Subspecies are members of the same species that are capable of mating and reproducing viable offspring, but they are considered separate subspecies due to geographic or behavioral isolation or other factors.
7.20.86	Figure 20.6 shows how the levels move toward specificity with other organisms.
7.20.87	Notice how the dog shares a domain with the widest diversity of organisms, including plants and butterflies.
7.20.88	At each sublevel, the organisms become more similar because they are more closely related.
7.20.89	Historically, scientists classified organisms using characteristics, but as DNA technology developed, more precise phylogenies have been determined.
7.20.90	At each sublevel in the taxonomic classification system, organisms become more similar.
7.20.91	Dogs and wolves are the same species because they can breed and produce viable offspring, but they are different enough to be classified as different subspecies.
7.20.92	Recent genetic analysis and other advancements have found that some earlier phylogenetic classifications do not align with the evolutionary past; therefore, changes and updates must be made as new discoveries occur.
7.20.93	Recall that phylogenetic trees are hypotheses and are modified as data becomes available.
7.20.94	In addition, classification historically has focused on grouping organisms mainly by shared characteristics and does not necessarily illustrate how the various groups relate to each other from an evolutionary perspective.
7.20.95	For example, despite the fact that a hippopotamus resembles a pig more than a whale, the hippopotamus may be the closest living relative of the whale.
7.20.96	Determining Evolutionary Relationships Scientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make evolutionary connections among organisms.
7.20.97	Similar to detective work, scientists must use evidence to uncover the facts.
7.20.98	In the case of phylogeny, evolutionary investigations focus on two types of evidence: morphologic (form and function) and genetic.
7.20.99	Two Options for Similarities
7.20.100	In general, organisms that share similar physical features and genomes tend to be more closely related than those that do not.
7.20.101	Such features that overlap both morphologically (in form) and genetically are referred to as homologous structures; they stem from developmental similarities that are based on evolution.
7.20.102	For example, the bones in the wings of bats and birds have homologous structures.
7.20.103	Bat and bird wings are homologous structures, indicating that bats and birds share a common evolutionary past.
7.20.104	Notice
7.20.105	it is not simply a single bone, but rather a grouping of several bones arranged in a similar way.
7.20.106	The more complex the feature, the more likely any kind of overlap is due to a common evolutionary past.
7.20.107	Imagine two people from different countries both inventing a car with all the same parts and in exactly the same arrangement without any previous or shared knowledge.
7.20.108	That outcome would be highly improbable.
7.20.109	However, if two people both invented a hammer, it would be reasonable to conclude that both could have the original idea without the help of the other.
7.20.110	The same relationship between complexity and shared evolutionary history is true for homologous structures in organisms.
7.20.111	Misleading Appearances
7.20.112	Some organisms may be very closely related, even though a minor genetic change caused a major morphological difference to make them look quite different.
7.20.113	Similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but appear very much alike.
7.20.114	This usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions.
7.20.115	When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is called an analogy or homoplasy.
7.20.116	For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and birds, but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different.
7.20.117	These are called analogous structures (Figure 20.8).
7.20.118	Similar traits can be either homologous or analogous.
7.20.119	Homologous structures share a similar embryonic origin; analogous organs have a similar function.
7.20.120	For example, the bones in the front flipper of a whale are homologous to the bones in the human arm.
7.20.121	These structures are not analogous.
7.20.122	The wings of a butterfly and the wings of a bird are analogous but not homologous.
7.20.123	Some structures are both analogous and homologous: the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat are both homologous and analogous.
7.20.124	Scientists must determine which type of similarity a feature exhibits to decipher the phylogeny of the organisms being studied.
7.20.125	The (c) wing of a honeybee is similar in shape to a (b) bird wing and (a) bat wing, and it serves the same function.
7.20.126	However, the honeybee wing is not composed of bones and has a distinctly different structure and embryonic origin.
7.20.127	These wing types (insect versus bat and bird) illustrate an analogy—similar structures that do not share an evolutionary history.
7.20.128	Molecular Comparisons
7.20.129	With the advancement of DNA technology, the area of molecular systematics, which describes the use of information on the molecular level including DNA analysis, has blossomed.
7.20.130	New computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms, but also uncover previously made errors.
7.20.131	As with physical characteristics, even the DNA sequence can be tricky to read in some cases.
7.20.132	For some situations, two very closely related organisms can appear unrelated if a mutation occurred that caused a shift in the genetic code.
7.20.133	An insertion or deletion mutation would move each nucleotide base over one place, causing two similar codes to appear unrelated.
7.20.134	Sometimes two segments of DNA code in distantly related organisms randomly share a high percentage of bases in the same locations, causing these organisms to appear closely related when they are not.
7.20.135	For both of these situations, computer technologies have been developed to help identify the actual relationships, and, ultimately, the coupled use of both morphologic and molecular information is more effective in determining phylogeny.
7.20.136	Why Does Phylogeny Matter?
7.20.137	Evolutionary biologists could list many reasons why understanding phylogeny is important to everyday life in human society.
7.20.138	For botanists, phylogeny acts as a guide to discovering new plants that can be used to benefit people.
7.20.139	Think of all the ways humans use plants—food, medicine, and clothing are a few examples.
7.20.140	If a plant contains a compound that is effective in treating cancer, scientists might want to examine all of the relatives of that plant for other useful drugs.
7.20.141	A research team in China identified a segment of DNA thought to be common to some medicinal plants in the family Fabaceae (the legume family) and worked to identify which species had this segment (Figure 20.9).
7.20.142	After testing plant species in this family, the team found a DNA marker (a known location on a chromosome that enabled them to identify the species) present.
7.20.143	Then, using the DNA to uncover phylogenetic relationships, the team could identify whether a newly discovered plant was in this family and assess its potential medicinal properties.
7.20.144	Building Phylogenetic Trees
7.20.145	How do scientists construct phylogenetic trees?
7.20.146	After the homologous and analogous traits are sorted, scientists often organize the homologous traits using a system called cladistics.
7.20.147	This system sorts organisms into clades: groups of organisms that descended from a single ancestor.
7.20.148	For example, in Figure 20.10, all of the organisms in the orange region evolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs.
7.20.149	Consequently, all of these organisms also have amniotic eggs and make a single clade, also called a monophyletic group.
7.20.150	Clades must include all of the descendants from a branch point.
7.20.151	Clades can vary in size depending on which branch point is being referenced.
7.20.152	The important factor is that all of the organisms in the clade or monophyletic group stem from a single point on the tree.
7.20.153	This can be remembered because monophyletic breaks down into “mono,” meaning one, and “phyletic,” meaning evolutionary relationship.
7.20.154	Figure 20.11 shows various examples of clades.
7.20.155	Notice how each clade comes from a single point, whereas the non-clade groups show branches that do not share a single point.
7.20.156	All the organisms within a clade stem from a single point on the tree.
7.20.157	A clade may contain multiple groups, as in the case of animals, fungi and plants, or a single group, as in the case of flagellates.
7.20.158	Groups that diverge at a different branch point, or that do not include all groups in a single branch point, are not considered clades.
7.20.159	Shared Characteristics Organisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify.
7.20.160	Scientists use the phrase “descent with modification” because even though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes, changes occur.
7.20.161	This pattern repeats over and over as one goes through the phylogenetic tree of life:
7.20.162	1.
7.20.163	A change in the genetic makeup of an organism leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group.
7.20.164	2.
7.20.165	Many organisms descend from this point and have this trait.
7.20.166	3.
7.20.167	New variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist, leading to new traits.
7.20.168	4.
7.20.169	With new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1 and repeat).
7.20.170	If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group, it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait.
7.20.171	The vertebrate in Figure 20.10 is a shared ancestral character.
7.20.172	Now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure.
7.20.173	Only some of the organisms in Figure 20.10 have this trait, and to those that do, it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree.
7.20.174	The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative.
7.20.175	The same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used.
7.20.176	Returning to Figure 20.10, note that the amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for the Amniota clade, while having hair is a shared derived character for some organisms in this group.
7.20.177	These terms help scientists distinguish between clades in the building of phylogenetic trees.
7.20.178	Choosing the Right Relationships Imagine being the person responsible for organizing all of the items in a department store properly—an overwhelming task.
7.20.179	Organizing the evolutionary relationships of all life on Earth proves much more difficult: scientists must span enormous blocks of time and work with information from long-extinct organisms.
7.20.180	Trying to decipher the proper connections, especially given the presence of homologies and analogies, makes the task of building an accurate tree of life extraordinarily difficult.
7.20.181	Add to that the advancement of DNA technology, which now provides large quantities of genetic sequences to be used and analyzed.
7.20.182	Taxonomy is a subjective discipline: many organisms have more than one connection to each other, so each taxonomist will decide the order of connections.
7.20.183	To aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately, scientists often use a concept called maximum parsimony, which means that events occurred in the simplest, most obvious way.
7.20.184	For example, if a group of people entered a forest preserve to go hiking, based on the principle of maximum parsimony, one could predict that most of the people would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones.
7.20.185	For scientists deciphering evolutionary pathways, the same idea is used: the pathway of evolution probably includes the fewest major events that coincide with the evidence at hand.
7.20.186	Starting with all of the homologous traits in a group of organisms, scientists look for the most obvious and simple order of evolutionary events that led to the occurrence of those traits.
7.20.187	These tools and concepts are only a few of the strategies scientists use to tackle the task of revealing the evolutionary history of life on Earth.
7.20.188	Recently, newer technologies have uncovered surprising discoveries with unexpected relationships, such as the fact that people seem to be more closely related to fungi than fungi are to plants.
7.20.189	Sound unbelievable?
7.20.190	As the information about DNA sequences grows, scientists will become closer to mapping the evolutionary history of all life on Earth.
7.20.191	Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree
7.20.192	The concepts of phylogenetic modeling are constantly changing.
7.20.193	It is one of the most dynamic fields of study in all of biology.
7.20.194	Over the last several decades, new research has challenged scientists’ ideas about how organisms are related.
7.20.195	New models of these relationships have been proposed for consideration by the scientific community.
7.20.196	Many phylogenetic trees have been shown as models of the evolutionary relationship among species.
7.20.197	Phylogenetic trees originated with Charles Darwin, who sketched the first phylogenetic tree in 1837 (Figure 20.12a), which served as a pattern for subsequent studies for more than a century.
7.20.198	The concept of a phylogenetic tree with a single trunk representing a common ancestor, with the branches representing the divergence of species from this ancestor, fits well with the structure of many common trees, such as the oak (Figure 20.12b).
7.20.199	However, evidence from modern DNA sequence analysis and newly developed computer algorithms has caused skepticism about the validity of the standard tree model in the scientific community.
7.20.200	The (a) concept of the “tree of life” goes back to an 1837 sketch by Charles Darwin.
7.20.201	Like an (b) oak tree, the “tree of life” has a single trunk and many branches.
7.20.202	Limitations to the Classic Model Classical thinking about prokaryotic evolution, included in the classic tree model, is that species evolve clonally.
7.20.203	That is, they produce offspring themselves with only random mutations causing the descent into the variety of modern-day and extinct species known to science.
7.20.204	This view is somewhat complicated in eukaryotes that reproduce sexually, but the laws of Mendelian genetics explain the variation in offspring, again, to be a result of a mutation within the species.
7.20.205	The concept of genes being transferred between unrelated species was not considered as a possibility until relatively recently.
7.20.206	Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), also known as lateral gene transfer, is the transfer of genes between unrelated species.
7.20.207	HGT has been shown to be an ever-present phenomenon, with many evolutionists postulating a major role for this process in evolution, thus complicating the simple tree model.
7.20.208	Genes have been shown to be passed between species which are only distantly related using standard phylogeny, thus adding a layer of complexity to the understanding of phylogenetic relationships.
7.20.209	The various ways that HGT occurs in prokaryotes is important to understanding phylogenies.
7.20.210	Although at present HGT is not viewed as important to eukaryotic evolution, HGT does occur in this domain as well.
7.20.211	Finally, as an example of the ultimate gene transfer, theories of genome fusion between symbiotic or endosymbiotic organisms have been proposed to explain an event of great importance—
7.20.212	the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell, without which humans could not have come into existence.
7.20.213	Horizontal Gene Transfer Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by mechanisms other than the vertical transmission from parent(s) to offspring.
7.20.214	These transfers allow even distantly related species to share genes, influencing their phenotypes.
7.20.215	It is thought that HGT is more prevalent in prokaryotes, but that only about 2% of the prokaryotic genome may be transferred by this process.
7.20.216	Some researchers believe such estimates are premature: the actual importance of HGT to evolutionary processes must be viewed as a work in progress.
7.20.217	As the phenomenon is investigated more thoroughly, it may be revealed to be more common.
7.20.218	Many scientists believe that HGT and mutation appear to be (especially in prokaryotes) a significant source of genetic variation, which is the raw material for the process of natural selection.
7.20.219	These transfers may occur between any two species that share an intimate relationship (Table 20.1).
7.20.220	HGT in Prokaryotes
7.20.221	The mechanism of HGT has been shown to be quite common in the prokaryotic domains of Bacteria and Archaea, significantly changing the way their evolution is viewed.
7.20.222	The majority of evolutionary models, such as in the Endosymbiont Theory, propose that eukaryotes descended from multiple prokaryotes, which makes HGT all the more important to understanding the phylogenetic relationships of all extant and extinct species.
7.20.223	The fact that genes are transferred among common bacteria is well known to microbiology students.
7.20.224	These gene transfers between species are the major mechanism whereby bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics.
7.20.225	Classically, this type of transfer has been thought to occur by three different mechanisms: 1.
7.20.226	Transformation:
7.20.227	naked DNA is taken up by a bacteria 2.
7.20.228	Transduction:
7.20.229	genes are transferred using a virus 3.
7.20.230	Conjugation: the use a hollow tube called a pilus to transfer genes between organisms More recently,
7.20.231	a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered.
7.20.232	Small, virus-like particles called gene transfer agents (GTAs) transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another.
7.20.233	GTAs have been shown to be responsible for genetic changes, sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes.
7.20.234	The first GTA was characterized in 1974 using purple, non-sulfur bacteria.
7.20.235	These GTAs, which are thought to be bacteriophages that lost the ability to reproduce on their own, carry random pieces of DNA from one organism to another.
7.20.236	The ability of GTAs to act with high frequency has been demonstrated in controlled studies using marine bacteria.
7.20.237	Gene transfer events in marine prokaryotes, either by GTAs or by viruses, have been estimated to be as high as 1013 per year in the Mediterranean Sea alone.
7.20.238	GTAs and viruses are thought to be efficient HGT vehicles with a major impact on prokaryotic evolution.
7.20.239	As a consequence of this modern DNA analysis, the idea that eukaryotes evolved directly from Archaea has fallen out of favor.
7.20.240	While eukaryotes share many features that are absent in bacteria, such as the TATA box (found in the promoter region of many genes), the discovery that some eukaryotic genes were more homologous with bacterial DNA than Archaea DNA made this idea less tenable.
7.20.241	Furthermore, the fusion of genomes from Archaea and Bacteria by endosymbiosis has been proposed as the ultimate event in eukaryotic evolution.
7.20.242	HGT in Eukaryotes
7.20.243	Although it is easy to see how prokaryotes exchange genetic material by HGT, it was initially thought that this process was absent in eukaryotes.
7.20.244	After all, prokaryotes are but single cells exposed directly to their environment, whereas the sex cells of multicellular organisms are usually sequestered in protected parts of the body.
7.20.245	It follows from this idea that the gene transfers between multicellular eukaryotes should be more difficult.
7.20.246	Indeed, it is thought that this process is rarer in eukaryotes and has a much smaller evolutionary impact than in prokaryotes.
7.20.247	In spite of this fact, HGT between distantly related organisms has been demonstrated in several eukaryotic species, and it is possible that more examples will be discovered in the future.
7.20.248	In plants, gene transfer has been observed in species that cannot cross-pollinate by normal means.
7.20.249	Transposons or “jumping genes” have been shown to transfer between rice and millet plant species.
7.20.250	Furthermore, fungal species feeding on yew trees, from which the anti-cancer drug TAXOL® is derived from the bark, have acquired the ability to make taxol themselves, a clear example of gene transfer.
7.20.251	In animals, a particularly interesting example of HGT occurs within the aphid species (Figure 20.13).
7.20.252	Aphids are insects that vary in color based on carotenoid content.
7.20.253	Carotenoids are pigments made by a variety of plants, fungi, and microbes, and they serve a variety of functions in animals, who obtain these chemicals from their food.
7.20.254	Humans require carotenoids to synthesize vitamin A, and we obtain them by eating orange fruits and vegetables: carrots, apricots, mangoes, and sweet potatoes.
7.20.255	On the other hand, aphids have acquired the ability to make the carotenoids on their own.
7.20.256	According to DNA analysis, this ability is due to the transfer of fungal genes into the insect by HGT, presumably as the insect consumed fungi for food.
7.20.257	A carotenoid enzyme called a desaturase is responsible for the red coloration seen in certain aphids, and it has been further shown that when this gene is inactivated by mutation, the aphids revert back to their more common green color (Figure 20.13).
7.20.258	(a) Red aphids get their color from red carotenoid pigment.
7.20.259	Genes necessary to make this pigment are present in certain fungi, and scientists speculate that aphids acquired these genes through HGT after consuming fungi for food.
7.20.260	If genes for making carotenoids are inactivated by mutation, the aphids revert back to (b) their green color.
7.20.261	Red coloration makes the aphids a lot more conspicuous to predators, but evidence suggests that red aphids are more resistant to insecticides than green ones.
7.20.262	Thus, red aphids may be more fit to survive in some environments than green ones.
7.20.263	Genome Fusion and the Evolution of Eukaryotes
7.20.264	Scientists believe the ultimate in HGT occurs through genome fusion between different species of prokaryotes when two symbiotic organisms become endosymbiotic.
7.20.265	This occurs when one species is taken inside the cytoplasm of another species, which ultimately results in a genome consisting of genes from both the endosymbiont and the host.
7.20.266	This mechanism is an aspect of the Endosymbiont Theory, which is accepted by a majority of biologists as the mechanism whereby eukaryotic cells obtained their mitochondria and chloroplasts.
7.20.267	However, the role of endosymbiosis in the development of the nucleus is more controversial.
7.20.268	Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of different (separate) evolutionary origin, with the mitochondrial DNA being derived from the circular genomes of bacteria that were engulfed by ancient prokaryotic cells.
7.20.269	Mitochondrial DNA can be regarded as the smallest chromosome.
7.20.270	Interestingly enough, mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother.
7.20.271	The mitochondrial DNA degrades in sperm when the sperm degrades in the fertilized egg or in other instances when the mitochondria located in the flagellum of the sperm fails to enter the egg.
7.20.272	Within the past decade, the process of genome fusion by endosymbiosis has been proposed by James Lake of the UCLA/ NASA Astrobiology Institute to be responsible for the evolution of the first eukaryotic cells (Figure 20.14a).
7.20.273	Using DNA analysis and a new mathematical algorithm called conditioned reconstruction (CR), his laboratory proposed that eukaryotic cells developed from an endosymbiotic gene fusion between two species, one an Archaea and the other a Bacteria.
7.20.274	As mentioned, some eukaryotic genes resemble those of Archaea, whereas others resemble those from Bacteria.
7.20.275	An endosymbiotic fusion event, such as Lake has proposed, would clearly explain this observation.
7.20.276	On the other hand, this work is new and the CR algorithm is relatively unsubstantiated, which causes many scientists to resist this hypothesis.
7.20.277	More recent work by Lake (Figure 20.14b) proposes that gram-negative bacteria, which are unique within their domain in that they contain two lipid bilayer membranes, indeed resulted from an endosymbiotic fusion of archaeal and bacterial species.
7.20.278	The double membrane would be a direct result of the endosymbiosis, with the endosymbiont picking up the second membrane from the host as it was internalized.
7.20.279	This mechanism has also been used to explain the double membranes found in mitochondria and chloroplasts.
7.20.280	Lake’s work is not without skepticism, and the ideas are still debated within the biological science community.
7.20.281	In addition to Lake’s hypothesis, there are several other competing theories as to the origin of eukaryotes.
7.20.282	How did the eukaryotic nucleus evolve?
7.20.283	One theory is that the prokaryotic cells produced an additional membrane that surrounded the bacterial chromosome.
7.20.284	Some bacteria have the DNA enclosed by two membranes; however, there is no evidence of a nucleolus or nuclear pores.
7.20.285	Other proteobacteria also have membrane-bound chromosomes.
7.20.286	If the eukaryotic nucleus evolved this way, we would expect one of the two types of prokaryotes to be more closely related to eukaryotes.
7.20.287	The theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts are endosymbiotic in origin is now widely accepted.
7.20.288	More controversial is the proposal that (a) the eukaryotic nucleus resulted from the fusion of archaeal and bacterial genomes, and that (b) Gram-negative bacteria, which have two membranes, resulted from the fusion of Archaea and Grampositive bacteria, each of which has a single membrane.
7.20.289	The nucleus-first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first (Figure 20.15a), followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria.
7.20.290	The mitochondria-first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host (Figure 20.15b), which subsequently acquired a nucleus, by fusion or other mechanisms, to become the first eukaryotic cell.
7.20.291	Most interestingly, the eukaryote-first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity (Figure 20.15c).
7.20.292	All of these hypotheses are testable.
7.20.293	Only time and more experimentation will determine which hypothesis is best supported by data.
7.20.294	Three alternate hypotheses of eukaryotic and prokaryotic evolution are (a) the nucleus-first hypothesis, (b) the mitochondrion-first hypothesis, and (c) the eukaryote-first hypothesis.
7.20.295	Web and Network Models
7.20.296	The recognition of the importance of HGT, especially in the evolution of prokaryotes, has caused some to propose abandoning the classic “tree of life” model.
7.20.297	In 1999, W. Ford Doolittle proposed a phylogenetic model that resembles a web or a network more than a tree.
7.20.298	The hypothesis is that eukaryotes evolved not from a single prokaryotic ancestor, but from a pool of many species that were sharing genes by HGT mechanisms.
7.20.299	As shown in Figure 20.16a, some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes, whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts.
7.20.300	This model is often called the “ web of life.
7.20.301	”
7.20.302	In an effort to save the tree analogy, some have proposed using the Ficus tree (Figure 20.16b) with its multiple trunks as a phylogenetic to represent a diminished evolutionary role for HGT.
7.20.303	In the (a) phylogenetic model proposed by W. Ford Doolittle, the “tree of life” arose from a community of ancestral cells, has multiple trunks, and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred.
7.20.304	Visually, this concept is better represented by (b) the multi-trunked Ficus than by the single trunk of the oak similar to the tree drawn by Darwin Figure 20.12.
7.20.305	Ring of Life
7.20.306	Models Others have proposed abandoning any tree-like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure, the so-called “ ring of life” (Figure 20.17); a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes.
7.20.307	Lake, again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm, proposes a ring-like model in which species of all three domains—Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya—evolved from a single pool of gene-swapping prokaryotes.
7.20.308	His laboratory proposes that this structure is the best fit for data from extensive DNA analyses performed in his laboratory, and that the ring model is the only one that adequately takes HGT and genomic fusion into account.
7.20.309	However, other phylogeneticists remain highly skeptical of this model.
7.20.310	According to the “ring of life” phylogenetic model, the three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes.
7.20.311	In summary, the “tree of life” model proposed by Darwin must be modified to include HGT.
7.20.312	Does this mean abandoning the tree model completely?
7.20.313	Even Lake argues that all attempts should be made to discover some modification of the tree model to allow it to accurately fit his data, and only the inability to do so will sway people toward his ring proposal.
7.20.314	This doesn’t mean a tree, web, or a ring will correlate completely to an accurate description of phylogenetic relationships of life.
7.20.315	A consequence of the new thinking about phylogenetic models is the idea that Darwin’s original conception of the phylogenetic tree is too simple, but made sense based on what was known at the time.
7.20.316	However, the search for a more useful model moves on: each model serving as hypotheses to be tested with the possibility of developing new models.
7.20.317	This is how science advances.
7.20.318	These models are used as visualizations to help construct hypothetical evolutionary relationships and understand the massive amount of data being analyzed.
7.21.0	VIRUSES
7.21.1	The tobacco mosaic virus (left), seen here by transmission electron microscopy, was the first virus to be discovered.
7.21.2	The virus causes disease in tobacco and other plants, such as the orchid.
7.21.3	Introduction
7.21.4	No one knows exactly when viruses emerged or from where they came, since viruses do not leave historical footprints such as fossils.
7.21.5	Modern viruses are thought to be a mosaic of bits and pieces of nucleic acids picked up from various sources along their respective evolutionary paths.
7.21.6	Viruses are acellular, parasitic entities that are not classified within any kingdom.
7.21.7	Unlike most living organisms, viruses are not cells and cannot divide.
7.21.8	Instead, they infect a host cell and use the host’s replication processes to produce identical progeny virus particles.
7.21.9	Viruses infect organisms as diverse as bacteria, plants, and animals.
7.21.10	They exist in a netherworld between a living organism and a nonliving entity.
7.21.11	Living things grow, metabolize, and reproduce.
7.21.12	Viruses replicate, but to do so, they are entirely dependent on their host cells.
7.21.13	They do not metabolize or grow, but are assembled in their mature form.
7.21.14	Viral Evolution, Morphology, and Classification Viruses are diverse entities.
7.21.15	They vary in their structure, their replication methods, and in their target hosts.
7.21.16	Nearly all forms of life—from bacteria and archaea to eukaryotes such as plants, animals, and fungi—have viruses that infect them.
7.21.17	While most biological diversity can be understood through evolutionary history, such as how species have adapted to conditions and environments, much about virus origins and evolution remains unknown.
7.21.18	Discovery and Detection Viruses were first discovered after the development of a porcelain filter, called the Chamberland-Pasteur filter, which could remove all bacteria visible in the microscope from any liquid sample.
7.21.19	In 1886, Adolph Meyer demonstrated that a disease of tobacco plants, tobacco mosaic disease, could be transferred from a diseased plant to a healthy one via liquid plant extracts.
7.21.20	In 1892, Dmitri Ivanowski showed that this disease could be transmitted in this way even after the Chamberland-Pasteur filter had removed all viable bacteria from the extract.
7.21.21	Still, it was many years before it was proven that these “filterable” infectious agents were not simply very small bacteria but were a new type of very small, disease-causing particle.
7.21.22	Virions, single virus particles, are very small, about 20–250 nanometers in diameter.
7.21.23	These individual virus particles are the infectious form of a virus outside the host cell.
7.21.24	Unlike bacteria (which are about 100-times larger), we cannot see viruses with a light microscope, with the exception of some large virions of the poxvirus family.
7.21.25	It was not until the development of the electron microscope in the late 1930s that scientists got their first good view of the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Figure 21.1) and other viruses (Figure 21.2).
7.21.26	The surface structure of virions can be observed by both scanning and transmission electron microscopy, whereas the internal structures of the virus can only be observed in images from a transmission electron microscope.
7.21.27	The use of these technologies has allowed for the discovery of many viruses of all types of living organisms.
7.21.28	They were initially grouped by shared morphology.
7.21.29	Later, groups of viruses were classified by the type of nucleic acid they contained, DNA or RNA, and whether their nucleic acid was single- or double-stranded.
7.21.30	More recently, molecular analysis of viral replicative cycles has further refined their classification.
7.21.31	In these transmission electron micrographs, (a) a virus is dwarfed by the bacterial cell it infects, while (b) these E. coli cells are dwarfed by cultured colon cells.
7.21.32	Evolution of Viruses
7.21.33	Although biologists have accumulated a significant amount of knowledge about how present-day viruses evolve, much less is known about how viruses originated in the first place.
7.21.34	When exploring the evolutionary history of most organisms, scientists can look at fossil records and similar historic evidence.
7.21.35	However, viruses do not fossilize, so researchers must conjecture by investigating how today’s viruses evolve and by using biochemical and genetic information to create speculative virus histories.
7.21.36	While most findings agree that viruses don’t have a single common ancestor, scholars have yet to find a single hypothesis about virus origins that is fully accepted in the field.
7.21.37	One such hypothesis, called devolution or the regressive hypothesis, proposes to explain the origin of viruses by suggesting that viruses evolved from free-living cells.
7.21.38	However, many components of how this process might have occurred are a mystery.
7.21.39	A second hypothesis (called escapist or the progressive hypothesis) accounts for viruses having either an RNA or a DNA genome and suggests that viruses originated from RNA and DNA molecules that escaped from a host cell.
7.21.40	A third hypothesis posits a system of self-replication similar to that of other self-replicating molecules, likely evolving alongside the cells they rely on as hosts; studies of some plant pathogens support this hypothesis.
7.21.41	As technology advances, scientists may develop and refine further hypotheses to explain the origin of viruses.
7.21.42	The emerging field called virus molecular systematics attempts to do just that through comparisons of sequenced genetic material.
7.21.43	These researchers hope to one day better understand the origin of viruses, a discovery that could lead to advances in the treatments for the ailments they produce.
7.21.44	Viral Morphology Viruses are acellular, meaning they are biological entities that do not have a cellular structure.
7.21.45	They therefore lack most of the components of cells, such as organelles, ribosomes, and the plasma membrane.
7.21.46	A virion consists of a nucleic acid core, an outer protein coating or capsid, and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell.
7.21.47	Viruses may also contain additional proteins, such as enzymes.
7.21.48	The most obvious difference between members of viral families is their morphology, which is quite diverse.
7.21.49	An interesting feature of viral complexity is that the complexity of the host does not correlate with the complexity of the virion.
7.21.50	Some of the most complex virion structures are observed in bacteriophages, viruses that infect the simplest living organisms, bacteria.
7.21.51	Morphology Viruses come in many shapes and sizes, but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family.
7.21.52	All virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins, called a capsid.
7.21.53	The capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres.
7.21.54	Some viral capsids are simple polyhedral “spheres,” whereas others are quite complex in structure.
7.21.55	In general, the shapes of viruses are classified into four groups: filamentous, isometric (or icosahedral), enveloped, and head and tail.
7.21.56	Filamentous viruses are long and cylindrical.
7.21.57	Many plant viruses are filamentous, including TMV.
7.21.58	Isometric viruses have shapes that are roughly spherical, such as poliovirus or herpesviruses.
7.21.59	Enveloped viruses have membranes surrounding capsids.
7.21.60	Animal viruses, such as HIV, are frequently enveloped.
7.21.61	Head and tail viruses infect bacteria and have a head that is similar to icosahedral viruses and a tail shape like filamentous viruses.
7.21.62	Many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors (Figure 21.3).
7.21.63	For these viruses, attachment is a requirement for later penetration of the cell membrane, so they can complete their replication inside the cell.
7.21.64	The receptors that viruses use are molecules that are normally found on cell surfaces and have their own physiological functions.
7.21.65	Viruses have simply evolved to make use of these molecules for their own replication.
7.21.66	For example, HIV uses the CD4 molecule on T lymphocytes as one of its receptors.
7.21.67	CD4 is a type of molecule called a cell adhesion molecule, which functions to keep different types of immune cells in close proximity to each other during the generation of a T lymphocyte immune response.
7.21.68	The KSHV virus binds the xCT receptor on the surface of human cells.
7.21.69	xCT receptors protect cells against stress.
7.21.70	Stressed cells express more xCT receptors than non-stressed cells.
7.21.71	The KSHV virion causes cells to become stressed, thereby increasing expression of the receptor to which it binds.
7.21.72	Among the most complex virions known, the T4 bacteriophage, which infects the Escherichia coli bacterium, has a tail structure that the virus uses to attach to host cells and a head structure that houses its DNA.
7.21.73	Adenovirus, a non-enveloped animal virus that causes respiratory illnesses in humans, uses glycoprotein spikes protruding from its capsomeres to attach to host cells.
7.21.74	Non-enveloped viruses also include those that cause polio (poliovirus), plantar warts (papillomavirus), and hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus).
7.21.75	Enveloped virions like HIV, the causative agent in AIDS, consist of nucleic acid (RNA in the case of HIV) and capsid proteins surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope and its associated proteins.
7.21.76	Glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope are used to attach to host cells.
7.21.77	Other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins that stabilize the envelope and often play a role in the assembly of progeny virions.
7.21.78	Chicken pox, influenza, and mumps are examples of diseases caused by viruses with envelopes.
7.21.79	Because of the fragility of the envelope, non-enveloped viruses are more resistant to changes in temperature, pH, and some disinfectants than enveloped viruses.
7.21.80	Overall, the shape of the virion and the presence or absence of an envelope tell us little about what disease the virus may cause or what species it might infect, but they are still useful means to begin viral classification (Figure 21.4).
7.21.81	Viruses can be either complex in shape or relatively simple.
7.21.82	This figure shows three relatively complex virions: the bacteriophage T4, with its DNA-containing head group and tail fibers that attach to host cells; adenovirus, which uses spikes from its capsid to bind to host cells; and HIV, which uses glycoproteins embedded in its envelope to bind to host cells.
7.21.83	Notice that HIV has proteins called matrix proteins, internal to the envelope, which help stabilize virion shape.
7.21.84	Types of Nucleic Acid Unlike nearly all living organisms that use DNA as their genetic material, viruses may use either DNA or RNA as theirs.
7.21.85	The virus core contains the genome or total genetic content of the virus.
7.21.86	Viral genomes tend to be small, containing only those genes that encode proteins that the virus cannot get from the host cell.
7.21.87	This genetic material may be single- or doublestranded.
7.21.88	It may also be linear or circular.
7.21.89	While most viruses contain a single nucleic acid, others have genomes that have several, which are called segments.
7.21.90	In DNA viruses, the viral DNA directs the host cell’s replication proteins to synthesize new copies of the viral genome and to transcribe and translate that genome into viral proteins.
7.21.91	DNA viruses cause human diseases, such as chickenpox, hepatitis B, and some venereal diseases, like herpes and genital warts.
7.21.92	RNA viruses contain only RNA as their genetic material.
7.21.93	To replicate their genomes in the host cell, the RNA viruses encode enzymes that can replicate RNA into DNA, which cannot be done by the host cell.
7.21.94	These RNA polymerase enzymes are more likely to make copying errors than DNA polymerases, and therefore often make mistakes during transcription.
7.21.95	For this reason, mutations in RNA viruses occur more frequently than in DNA viruses.
7.21.96	This causes them to change and adapt more rapidly to their host.
7.21.97	Human diseases caused by RNA viruses include hepatitis C, measles, and rabies.
7.21.98	Virus Classification
7.21.99	To understand the features shared among different groups of viruses, a classification scheme is necessary.
7.21.100	As most viruses are not thought to have evolved from a common ancestor, however, the methods that scientists use to classify living things are not very useful.
7.21.101	Biologists have used several classification systems in the past, based on the morphology and genetics of the different viruses.
7.21.102	However, these earlier classification methods grouped viruses differently, based on which features of the virus they were using to classify them.
7.21.103	The most commonly used classification method today is called the Baltimore classification scheme and is based on how messenger RNA (mRNA) is generated in each particular type of virus.
7.21.104	Past Systems of Classification Viruses are classified in several ways: by factors such as their core content (Table 21.1 and Figure 21.3), the structure of their capsids, and whether they have an outer envelope.
7.21.105	The type of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and its structure (single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and segmented or non-segmented) are used to classify the virus core structures.
7.21.106	Viruses are classified based on their core genetic material and capsid design.
7.21.107	(a)
7.21.108	Rabies virus has a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) core and an enveloped helical capsid, whereas (b) variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, has a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) core and a complex capsid.
7.21.109	Rabies transmission occurs when saliva from an infected mammal enters a wound.
7.21.110	The virus travels through neurons in the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system where it impairs brain function, and then travels to other tissues.
7.21.111	The virus can infect any mammal, and most die within weeks of infection.
7.21.112	Smallpox is a human virus transmitted by inhalation of the variola virus, localized in the skin, mouth, and throat, which causes a characteristic rash.
7.21.113	Before its eradication in 1979, infection resulted in a 30–35 percent mortality rate.
7.21.114	Viruses can also be classified by the design of their capsids (Figure 21.4 and Figure 21.5).
7.21.115	Capsids are classified as naked icosahedral, enveloped icosahedral, enveloped helical, naked helical, and complex (Figure 21.6 and Figure 21.7).
7.21.116	The type of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and its structure (single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and segmented or nonsegmented) are used to classify the virus core structures (Table 21.2).
7.21.117	Adenovirus (left) is depicted with a double-stranded DNA genome enclosed in an icosahedral capsid that is 90–100 nm across.
7.21.118	The virus, shown clustered in the micrograph (right), is transmitted orally and causes a variety of illnesses in vertebrates, including human eye and respiratory infections.
7.21.119	( Transmission electron micrographs of various viruses show their structures.
7.21.120	The capsid of the (a) polio virus is naked icosahedral; (b) the Epstein-Barr virus capsid is enveloped icosahedral; (c) the mumps virus capsid is an enveloped helix; (d) the tobacco mosaic virus capsid is naked helical; and (e) the herpesvirus capsid is complex.
7.21.121	Baltimore Classification
7.21.122	The most commonly used system of virus classification was developed by Nobel Prize-winning biologist David Baltimore in the early 1970s.
7.21.123	In addition to the differences in morphology and genetics mentioned above, the Baltimore classification scheme groups viruses according to how the mRNA is produced during the replicative cycle of the virus.
7.21.124	Group I viruses contain double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as their genome.
7.21.125	Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA.
7.21.126	Group II viruses have single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as their genome.
7.21.127	They convert their single-stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur.
7.21.128	Group III viruses use dsRNA as their genome.
7.21.129	The strands separate, and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus.
7.21.130	Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity.
7.21.131	Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA.
7.21.132	Intermediates of dsRNA, called replicative intermediates, are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA.
7.21.133	Multiple, full-length RNA strands of negative polarity (complimentary to the positive-stranded genomic RNA) are formed from these intermediates, which may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity, including both full-length genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs.
7.21.134	Group V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity, meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mRNA.
7.21.135	As with Group IV viruses, dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the genome and produce mRNA.
7.21.136	In this case, the negative-stranded genome can be converted directly to mRNA.
7.21.137	Additionally, fulllength positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative-stranded genome.
7.21.138	Group VI viruses have diploid (two copies) ssRNA genomes that must be converted, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase, to dsDNA; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome.
7.21.139	Then, mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome.
7.21.140	Group VII viruses have partial dsDNA genomes and make ssRNA intermediates that act as mRNA, but are also converted back into dsDNA genomes by reverse transcriptase, necessary for genome replication.
7.21.141	The characteristics of each group in the Baltimore classification are summarized in Table 21.3 with examples of each group.
7.21.142	Virus Infections and Hosts certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host.
7.21.143	Cells that a virus may use to replicate are called permissive.
7.21.144	For most viruses, the molecular basis for this specificity is that a particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach.
7.21.145	Also, metabolic and host cell immune response differences seen in different cell types based on differential gene expression are a likely factor in which cells a virus may target for replication.
7.21.146	The permissive cell must make the substances that the virus needs or the virus will not be able to replicate there.
7.21.147	Steps of Virus Infections
7.21.148	A virus must use cell processes to replicate.
7.21.149	The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell, which may cause cell damage.
7.21.150	These changes, called cytopathic (causing cell damage) effects, can change cell functions or even destroy the cell.
7.21.151	Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, die through lysis (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death or “cell suicide”), releasing all progeny virions at once.
7.21.152	The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus, which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body, and from cell damage caused by the virus.
7.21.153	Many animal viruses, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding, where virions leave the cell individually.
7.21.154	During the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed.
7.21.155	However, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make it impossible for the cells to function normally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time.
7.21.156	Most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release (Figure 21.8).
7.21.157	Attachment A virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope.
7.21.158	The specificity of this interaction determines the host—and the cells within the host—that can be infected by a particular virus.
7.21.159	This can be illustrated by thinking of several keys and several locks, where each key will fit only one specific lock.
7.21.160	Entry
7.21.161	The nucleic acid of bacteriophages enters the host cell naked, leaving the capsid outside the cell.
7.21.162	Plant and animal viruses can enter through endocytosis, in which the cell membrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus.
7.21.163	Some enveloped viruses enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly with the cell membrane.
7.21.164	Once inside the cell, the viral capsid is degraded, and the viral nucleic acid is released, which then becomes available for replication and transcription.
7.21.165	Replication and Assembly
7.21.166	The replication mechanism depends on the viral genome.
7.21.167	DNA viruses usually use host cell proteins and enzymes to make additional DNA that is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then used to direct protein synthesis.
7.21.168	RNA viruses usually use the RNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA.
7.21.169	The viral mRNA directs the host cell to synthesize viral enzymes and capsid proteins, and assemble new virions.
7.21.170	Of course, there are exceptions to this pattern.
7.21.171	If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral genes supply the information to direct synthesis of the missing proteins.
7.21.172	Retroviruses, such as HIV, have an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed into DNA, which then is incorporated into the host cell genome.
7.21.173	They are within group VI of the Baltimore classification scheme.
7.21.174	To convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses must contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse transcriptase that transcribes an RNA template to DNA.
7.21.175	Reverse transcription never occurs in uninfected host cells—the needed enzyme reverse transcriptase is only derived from the expression of viral genes within the infected host cells.
7.21.176	The fact that HIV produces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes.
7.21.177	These drugs, including the reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT, inhibit HIV replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the host’s metabolism.
7.21.178	This approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat HIV and has been effective at reducing the number of infectious virions (copies of viral RNA) in the blood to non-detectable levels in many HIV-infected individuals.
7.21.179	Egress
7.21.180	The last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions produced in the host organism, where they are able to infect adjacent cells and repeat the replication cycle.
7.21.181	As you’ve learned, some viruses are released when the host cell dies, and other viruses can leave infected cells by budding through the membrane without directly killing the cell.
7.21.182	In influenza virus infection, glycoproteins attach to a host epithelial cell.
7.21.183	As a result, the virus is engulfed.
7.21.184	RNA and proteins are made and assembled into new virions.
7.21.185	Different Hosts and Their Viruses
7.21.186	As you’ve learned, viruses are often very specific as to which hosts and which cells within the host they will infect.
7.21.187	This feature of a virus makes it specific to one or a few species of life on Earth.
7.21.188	On the other hand, so many different types of viruses exist on Earth that nearly every living organism has its own set of viruses that tries to infect its cells.
7.21.189	Even the smallest and simplest of cells, prokaryotic bacteria, may be attacked by specific types of viruses.
7.21.190	This transmission electron micrograph shows bacteriophages attached to a bacterial cell.
7.21.191	(credit: modification of work by Dr. Graham Beards; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.21.192	Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria (Figure 21.9).
7.21.193	When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions, the infection is said to be productive.
7.21.194	If the virions are released by bursting the cell, the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle (Figure 21.10).
7.21.195	An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4, which infects Escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract.
7.21.196	Sometimes, however, a virus can remain within the cell without being released.
7.21.197	For example, when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle (Figure 21.10), and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell.
7.21.198	When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome, it is called a prophage.
7.21.199	An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the λ (lambda) virus, which also infects the E. coli bacterium.
7.21.200	Viruses that infect plant or animal cells may also undergo infections where they are not producing virions for long periods.
7.21.201	An example is the animal herpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans.
7.21.202	In a process called latency, these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions, only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates.
7.21.203	Even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency, the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages.
7.21.204	Latency will be described in more detail below.
7.21.205	A temperate bacteriophage has both lytic and lysogenic cycles.
7.21.206	In the lytic cycle, the phage replicates and lyses the host cell.
7.21.207	In the lysogenic cycle, phage DNA is incorporated into the host genome, where it is passed on to subsequent generations.
7.21.208	Environmental stressors such as starvation or exposure to toxic chemicals may cause the prophage to excise and enter the lytic cycle.
7.21.209	Animal Viruses Animal viruses, unlike the viruses of plants and bacteria, do not have to penetrate a cell wall to gain access to the host cell.
7.21.210	Non-enveloped or “naked” animal viruses may enter cells in two different ways.
7.21.211	As a protein in the viral capsid binds to its receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the cell via a vesicle during the normal cell process of receptormediated endocytosis.
7.21.212	An alternative method of cell penetration used by non-enveloped viruses is for capsid proteins to undergo shape changes after binding to the receptor, creating channels in the host cell membrane.
7.21.213	The viral genome is then “injected” into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages.
7.21.214	Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis, or fusion.
7.21.215	Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non-enveloped viruses.
7.21.216	On the other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions.
7.21.217	These viruses, which include HIV among others, use special fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus releasing the genome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm.
7.21.218	After making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions and exit the cell.
7.21.219	As we have already discussed using the example of HIV, enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane as they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cell’s plasma membrane in the process.
7.21.220	On the other hand, non-enveloped viral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in infected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are released together.
7.21.221	As you will learn in the next module, animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases.
7.21.222	Some of them follow the classic pattern of acute disease, where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection.
7.21.223	Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza.
7.21.224	Other viruses cause long-term chronic infections, such as the virus causing hepatitis C, whereas others, like herpes simplex virus, only cause intermittent symptoms.
7.21.225	Still other viruses, such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7, which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola, often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host, and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection.
7.21.226	In hepatitis C infections, the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells, causing low levels of liver damage.
7.21.227	The damage is so low that infected individuals are often unaware that they are infected, and many infections are detected only by routine blood work on patients with risk factors such as intravenous drug use.
7.21.228	On the other hand, since many of the symptoms of viral diseases are caused by immune responses, a lack of symptoms is an indication of a weak immune response to the virus.
7.21.229	This allows for the virus to escape elimination by the immune system and persist in individuals for years, all the while producing low levels of progeny virions in what is known as a chronic viral disease.
7.21.230	Chronic infection of the liver by this virus leads to a much greater chance of developing liver cancer, sometimes as much as 30 years after the initial infection.
7.21.231	As already discussed, herpes simplex virus can remain in a state of latency in nervous tissue for months, even years.
7.21.232	As the virus “hides” in the tissue and makes few if any viral proteins, there is nothing for the immune response to act against, and immunity to the virus slowly declines.
7.21.233	Under certain conditions, including various types of physical and psychological stress, the latent herpes simplex virus may be reactivated and undergo a lytic replication cycle in the skin, causing the lesions associated with the disease.
7.21.234	Once virions are produced in the skin and viral proteins are synthesized, the immune response is again stimulated and resolves the skin lesions in a few days by destroying viruses in the skin.
7.21.235	As a result of this type of replicative cycle, appearances of cold sores and genital herpes outbreaks only occur intermittently, even though the viruses remain in the nervous tissue for life.
7.21.236	Latent infections are common with other herpesviruses as well, including the varicellazoster virus that causes chickenpox.
7.21.237	After having a chickenpox infection in childhood, the varicella-zoster virus can remain latent for many years and reactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as “shingles”
7.21.238	(Figure 21.11ab).
7.21.239	(a)
7.21.240	Varicella-zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox, has an enveloped icosahedral capsid visible in this transmission electron micrograph.
7.21.241	Its double-stranded DNA genome becomes incorporated in the host DNA and can reactivate after latency in the form of (b) shingles, often exhibiting a rash.
7.21.242	Some animal-infecting viruses, including the hepatitis C virus discussed above, are known as oncogenic viruses: They have the ability to cause cancer.
7.21.243	These viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either introducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth (oncogenes) or by interfering with the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth.
7.21.244	Oncogenic viruses can be either DNA or RNA viruses.
7.21.245	Cancers known to be associated with viral infections include cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV)
7.21.246	(Figure 21.12), liver cancer caused by hepatitis B virus, T-cell leukemia, and several types of lymphoma.
7.21.247	HPV, or human papillomavirus, has a naked icosahedral capsid visible in this transmission electron micrograph and a double-stranded DNA genome that is incorporated into the host DNA.
7.21.248	The virus, which is sexually transmitted, is oncogenic and can lead to cervical cancer.
7.21.249	Plant Viruses Plant viruses, like other viruses, contain a core of either DNA or RNA.
7.21.250	You have already learned about one of these, the tobacco mosaic virus.
7.21.251	As plant viruses have a cell wall to protect their cells, these viruses do not use receptor-mediated endocytosis to enter host cells as is seen with animal viruses.
7.21.252	For many plant viruses to be transferred from plant to plant, damage to some of the plants’ cells must occur to allow the virus to enter a new host.
7.21.253	This damage is often caused by weather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping.
7.21.254	Additionally, plant offspring may inherit viral diseases from parent plants.
7.21.255	Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors, through contact with an infected plant’s sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through pollen.
7.21.256	When plants viruses are transferred between different plants, this is known as horizontal transmission, and when they are inherited from a parent, this is called vertical transmission.
7.21.257	Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host (Table 21.4).
7.21.258	One common symptom is hyperplasia, the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls.
7.21.259	Other viruses induce hypoplasia, or decreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear.
7.21.260	Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells, a process known as cell necrosis.
7.21.261	Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves, black streaks on the stems of the plants, altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits, and ring spots, which are circular or linear areas of discoloration found in a leaf.
7.21.262	Plant viruses can seriously disrupt crop growth and development, significantly affecting our food supply.
7.21.263	They are responsible for poor crop quality and quantity globally, and can bring about huge economic losses annually.
7.21.264	Others viruses may damage plants used in landscaping.
7.21.265	Some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include the name of the plant they infect, such as tomato spotted wilt virus, bean common mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus.
7.21.266	In plants used for landscaping, two of the most common viruses are peony ring spot and rose mosaic virus.
7.21.267	There are far too many plant viruses to discuss each in detail, but symptoms of bean common mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted, unproductive plants.
7.21.268	In the ornamental rose, the rose mosaic disease causes wavy yellow lines and colored splotches on the leaves of the plant.
7.21.269	Prevention and Treatment of Viral Infections Viruses cause a variety of diseases in animals, including humans, ranging from the common cold to potentially fatal illnesses like meningitis (Figure 21.13).
7.21.270	These diseases can be treated by antiviral drugs or by vaccines, but some viruses, such as HIV, are capable of both avoiding the immune response and mutating to become resistant to antiviral drugs.
7.21.271	Viruses can cause dozens of ailments in humans, ranging from mild illnesses to serious diseases.
7.21.272	Vaccines for Prevention
7.21.273	While we do have limited numbers of effective antiviral drugs, such as those used to treat HIV and influenza, the primary method of controlling viral disease is by vaccination, which is intended to prevent outbreaks by building immunity to a virus or virus family (Figure 21.14).
7.21.274	Vaccines may be prepared using live viruses, killed viruses, or molecular subunits of the virus.
7.21.275	The killed viral vaccines and subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease.
7.21.276	Live viral vaccines are designed in the laboratory to cause few symptoms in recipients while giving them protective immunity against future infections.
7.21.277	Polio was one disease that represented a milestone in the use of vaccines.
7.21.278	Mass immunization campaigns in the 1950s (killed vaccine) and 1960s (live vaccine) significantly reduced the incidence of the disease, which caused muscle paralysis in children and generated a great amount of fear in the general population when regional epidemics occurred.
7.21.279	The success of the polio vaccine paved the way for the routine dispensation of childhood vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and other diseases.
7.21.280	The danger of using live vaccines, which are usually more effective than killed vaccines, is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease-causing form by back mutations.
7.21.281	Live vaccines are usually made by attenuating (weakening) the “wild-type” (disease-causing) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host.
7.21.282	Adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of the virus, allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host.
7.21.283	These attenuated viruses thus still cause infection, but they do not grow very well, allowing the immune response to develop in time to prevent major disease.
7.21.284	Back mutations occur when the vaccine undergoes mutations in the host such that it readapts to the host and can again cause disease, which can then be spread to other humans in an epidemic.
7.21.285	This type of scenario happened as recently as 2007 in Nigeria where mutations in a polio vaccine led to an epidemic of polio in that country.
7.21.286	Some vaccines are in continuous development because certain viruses, such as influenza and HIV, have a high mutation rate compared to other viruses and normal host cells.
7.21.287	With influenza, mutations in the surface molecules of the virus help the organism evade the protective immunity that may have been obtained in a previous influenza season, making it necessary for individuals to get vaccinated every year.
7.21.288	Other viruses, such as those that cause the childhood diseases measles, mumps, and rubella, mutate so infrequently that the same vaccine is used year after year.
7.21.289	Vaccines and Anti-viral Drugs for Treatment
7.21.290	In some cases, vaccines can be used to treat an active viral infection.
7.21.291	The concept behind this is that by giving the vaccine, immunity is boosted without adding more disease-causing virus.
7.21.292	In the case of rabies, a fatal neurological disease transmitted via the saliva of rabies virus-infected animals, the progression of the disease from the time of the animal bite to the time it enters the central nervous system may be 2 weeks or longer.
7.21.293	This is enough time to vaccinate an individual who suspects that they have been bitten by a rabid animal, and their boosted immune response is sufficient to prevent the virus from entering nervous tissue.
7.21.294	Thus, the potentially fatal neurological consequences of the disease are averted, and the individual only has to recover from the infected bite.
7.21.295	This approach is also being used for the treatment of Ebola, one of the fastest and most deadly viruses on earth.
7.21.296	Transmitted by bats and great apes, this disease can cause death in 70–90 percent of infected humans within 2 weeks.
7.21.297	Using newly developed vaccines that boost the immune response in this way, there is hope that affected individuals will be better able to control the virus, potentially saving a greater percentage of infected persons from a rapid and very painful death.
7.21.298	Another way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs.
7.21.299	These drugs often have limited success in curing viral disease, but in many cases, they have been used to control and reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases.
7.21.300	For most viruses, these drugs can inhibit the virus by blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins.
7.21.301	It is important that the targeted proteins be encoded by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell.
7.21.302	In this way, viral growth is inhibited without damaging the host.
7.21.303	There are large numbers of antiviral drugs available to treat infections, some specific for a particular virus and others that can affect multiple viruses.
7.21.304	Antivirals have been developed to treat genital herpes (herpes simplex II) and influenza.
7.21.305	For genital herpes, drugs such as acyclovir can reduce the number and duration of episodes of active viral disease, during which patients develop viral lesions in their skin cells.
7.21.306	As the virus remains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life, this drug is not curative but can make the symptoms of the disease more manageable.
7.21.307	For influenza, drugs like Tamiflu (oseltamivir)
7.21.308	(Figure 21.15) can reduce the duration of “flu” symptoms by 1 or 2 days, but the drug does not prevent symptoms entirely.
7.21.309	Tamiflu works by inhibiting an enzyme (viral neuraminidase) that allows new virions to leave their infected cells.
7.21.310	Thus, Tamiflu inhibits the spread of virus from infected to uninfected cells.
7.21.311	Other antiviral drugs, such as Ribavirin, have been used to treat a variety of viral infections, although its mechanism of action against certain viruses remains unclear.
7.21.312	(a)
7.21.313	Tamiflu inhibits a viral enzyme called neuraminidase (NA) found in the influenza viral envelope.
7.21.314	(b)
7.21.315	Neuraminidase cleaves the connection between viral hemagglutinin (HA), also found in the viral envelope, and glycoproteins on the host cell surface.
7.21.316	Inhibition of neuraminidase prevents the virus from detaching from the host cell, thereby blocking further infection.
7.21.317	By far, the most successful use of antivirals has been in the treatment of the retrovirus HIV, which causes a disease that, if untreated, is usually fatal within 10–12 years after infection.
7.21.318	Anti-HIV drugs have been able to control viral replication to the point that individuals receiving these drugs survive for a significantly longer time than the untreated.
7.21.319	Anti-HIV drugs inhibit viral replication at many different phases of the HIV replicative cycle (Figure 21.16).
7.21.320	Drugs have been developed that inhibit the fusion of the HIV viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell (fusion inhibitors), the conversion of its RNA genome into double-stranded DNA (reverse transcriptase inhibitors), the integration of the viral DNA into the host genome (integrase inhibitors), and the processing of viral proteins (protease inhibitors).
7.21.321	HIV, an enveloped, icosahedral virus, attaches to the CD4 receptor of an immune cell and fuses with the cell membrane.
7.21.322	Viral contents are released into the cell, where viral enzymes convert the single-stranded RNA genome into DNA and incorporate it into the host genome.
7.21.323	(credit: NIAID, NIH)
7.21.324	When any of these drugs are used individually, the high mutation rate of the virus allows it to easily and rapidly develop resistance to the drug, limiting the drug’s effectiveness.
7.21.325	The breakthrough in the treatment of HIV was the development of HAART, highly active anti-retroviral therapy, which involves a mixture of different drugs, sometimes called a drug “cocktail.
7.21.326	”
7.21.327	By attacking the virus at different stages of its replicative cycle, it is much more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to multiple drugs at the same time.
7.21.328	Still, even with the use of combination HAART therapy, there is concern that, over time, the virus will develop resistance to this therapy.
7.21.329	Thus, new anti-HIV drugs are constantly being developed with the hope of continuing the battle against this highly fatal virus.
7.21.330	Applied Virology
7.21.331	The study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non-viral diseases.
7.21.332	Viruses have been used in gene therapy.
7.21.333	Gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a heritable, recessive disease in which children are born with severely compromised immune systems.
7.21.334	One common type of SCID is due to the lack of an enzyme, adenosine deaminase (ADA), which breaks down purine bases.
7.21.335	To treat this disease by gene therapy, bone marrow cells are taken from a SCID patient and the ADA gene is inserted.
7.21.336	This is where viruses come in, and their use relies on their ability to penetrate living cells and bring genes in with them.
7.21.337	Viruses such as adenovirus, an upper respiratory human virus, are modified by the addition of the ADA gene, and the virus then transports this gene into the cell.
7.21.338	The modified cells, now capable of making ADA, are then given back to the patients in the hope of curing them.
7.21.339	Gene therapy using viruses as carrier of genes (viral vectors), although still experimental, holds promise for the treatment of many genetic diseases.
7.21.340	Still, many technological problems need to be solved for this approach to be a viable method for treating genetic disease.
7.21.341	Another medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect.
7.21.342	Oncolytic viruses are engineered in the laboratory specifically to attack and kill cancer cells.
7.21.343	A genetically modified adenovirus known as H101 has been used since 2005 in clinical trials in China to treat head and neck cancers.
7.21.344	The results have been promising, with a greater short-term response rate to the combination of chemotherapy and viral therapy than to chemotherapy treatment alone.
7.21.345	This ongoing research may herald the beginning of a new age of cancer therapy, where viruses are engineered to find and specifically kill cancer cells, regardless of where in the body they may have spread.
7.21.346	A third use of viruses in medicine relies on their specificity and involves using bacteriophages in the treatment of bacterial infections.
7.21.347	Bacterial diseases have been treated with antibiotics since the 1940s.
7.21.348	However, over time, many bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics.
7.21.349	A good example is methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, pronounced “mersa”), an infection commonly acquired in hospitals.
7.21.350	This bacterium is resistant to a variety of antibiotics, making it difficult to treat.
7.21.351	The use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill them.
7.21.352	Although phage therapy is in use in the Republic of Georgia to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries.
7.21.353	However, the safety of the treatment was confirmed in the United States when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen Listeria.
7.21.354	As more and more antibioticresistant strains of bacteria evolve, the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem, and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide.
7.21.355	Prions and viroids are pathogens (agents with the ability to cause disease) that have simpler structures than viruses but, in the case of prions, still can produce deadly diseases.
7.21.356	Prions Prions, so-called because they are proteinaceous, are infectious particles—smaller than viruses—that contain no nucleic acids (neither DNA nor RNA).
7.21.357	Historically, the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic acids was considered impossible, but pioneering work by Nobel Prize-winning biologist Stanley Prusiner has convinced the majority of biologists that such agents do indeed exist.
7.21.358	Fatal neurodegenerative diseases, such as kuru in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle (commonly known as “mad cow disease”) were shown to be transmitted by prions.
7.21.359	The disease was spread by the consumption of meat, nervous tissue, or internal organs between members of the same species.
7.21.360	Kuru, native to humans in Papua New Guinea, was spread from human to human via ritualistic cannibalism.
7.21.361	BSE, originally detected in the United Kingdom, was spread between cattle by the practice of including cattle nervous tissue in feed for other cattle.
7.21.362	Individuals with kuru and BSE show symptoms of loss of motor control and unusual behaviors, such as uncontrolled bursts of laughter with kuru, followed by death.
7.21.363	Kuru was controlled by inducing the population to abandon its ritualistic cannibalism.
7.21.364	On the other hand, BSE was initially thought to only affect cattle.
7.21.365	Cattle dying of the disease were shown to have developed lesions or “holes” in the brain, causing the brain tissue to resemble a sponge.
7.21.366	Later on in the outbreak, however, it was shown that a similar encephalopathy in humans known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) could be acquired from eating beef from animals with BSE, sparking bans by various countries on the importation of British beef and causing considerable economic damage to the British beef industry (Figure 21.17).
7.21.367	BSE still exists in various areas, and although a rare disease, individuals that acquire CJD are difficult to treat.
7.21.368	The disease can be spread from human to human by blood, so many countries have banned blood donation from regions associated with BSE.
7.21.369	The cause of spongiform encephalopathies, such as kuru and BSE, is an infectious structural variant of a normal cellular protein called PrP (prion protein).
7.21.370	It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle.
7.21.371	PrP exists in two forms, PrPc, the normal form of the protein, and PrPsc, the infectious form.
7.21.372	Once introduced into the body, the PrPsc contained within the prion binds to PrPc and converts it to PrPsc.
7.21.373	This leads to an exponential increase of the PrPsc protein, which aggregates.
7.21.374	PrPsc is folded abnormally, and the resulting conformation (shape) is directly responsible for the lesions seen in the brains of infected cattle.
7.21.375	Thus, although not without some detractors among scientists, the prion seems likely to be an entirely new form of infectious agent, the first one found whose transmission is not reliant upon genes made of DNA or RNA.
7.21.376	(a) Endogenous normal prion protein (PrPc) is converted into the disease-causing form (PrPsc) when it encounters this variant form of the protein.
7.21.377	PrPsc may arise spontaneously in brain tissue, especially if a mutant form of the protein is present, or it may occur via the spread of misfolded prions consumed in food into brain tissue.
7.21.378	(b)
7.21.379	This prion-infected brain tissue, visualized using light microscopy, shows the vacuoles that give it a spongy texture, typical of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
7.21.380	Viroids Viroids are plant pathogens: small, single-stranded, circular RNA particles that are much simpler than a virus.
7.21.381	They do not have a capsid or outer envelope, but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell.
7.21.382	Viroids do not, however, manufacture any proteins, and they only produce a single, specific RNA molecule.
7.21.383	Human diseases caused by viroids have yet to be identified.
7.21.384	Viroids are known to infect plants (Figure 21.18) and are responsible for crop failures and the loss of millions of dollars in agricultural revenue each year.
7.21.385	Some of the plants they infect include potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, chrysanthemums, avocados, and coconut palms.
7.21.386	These potatoes have been infected by the potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV), which is typically spread when infected knives are used to cut healthy potatoes, which are then planted.
7.21.387	Virologist Virology is the study of viruses, and a virologist is an individual trained in this discipline.
7.21.388	Training in virology can lead to many different career paths.
7.21.389	Virologists are actively involved in academic research and teaching in colleges and medical schools.
7.21.390	Some virologists treat patients or are involved in the generation and production of vaccines.
7.21.391	They might participate in epidemiologic studies (Figure 21.19) or become science writers, to name just a few possible careers.
7.21.392	centers have departments of virology, and smaller hospitals usually have virology labs within their microbiology departments.
7.21.393	Volunteer in a virology lab for a semester or work in one over the summer.
7.21.394	Discussing the profession and getting a first-hand look at the work will help you decide whether a career in virology is right for you.
7.21.395	The American Society of Virology’s website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/asv) is a good resource for information regarding training and careers in virology.
7.22.0	Certain prokaryotes can live in extreme environments such as the Morning Glory pool, a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park.
7.22.1	The spring’s vivid blue color is from the prokaryotes that thrive in its very hot waters.
7.22.2	In the recent past, scientists grouped living things into five kingdoms—animals, plants, fungi, protists, and prokaryotes—based on several criteria, such as the absence or presence of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, the absence or presence of cell walls, multicellularity, and so on.
7.22.3	In the late 20th century, the pioneering work of Carl Woese and others compared sequences of small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA), which resulted in a more fundamental way to group organisms on Earth.
7.22.4	Based on differences in the structure of cell membranes and in rRNA, Woese and his colleagues proposed that all life on Earth evolved along three lineages, called domains.
7.22.5	The domain Bacteria comprises all organisms in the kingdom Bacteria, the domain Archaea comprises the rest of the prokaryotes, and the domain Eukarya comprises all eukaryotes—including organisms in the kingdoms Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and Protista.
7.22.6	Two of the three domains—Bacteria and Archaea—are prokaryotic.
7.22.7	Prokaryotes were the first inhabitants on Earth, appearing 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago.
7.22.8	These organisms are abundant and ubiquitous; that is, they are present everywhere.
7.22.9	In addition to inhabiting moderate environments, they are found in extreme conditions: from boiling springs to permanently frozen environments in Antarctica; from salty environments like the Dead Sea to environments under tremendous pressure, such as the depths of the ocean; and from areas without oxygen, such as a waste management plant, to radioactively contaminated regions, such as Chernobyl.
7.22.10	Prokaryotes reside in the human digestive system and on the skin, are responsible for certain illnesses, and serve an important role in the preparation of many foods.
7.22.11	Prokaryotes are ubiquitous.
7.22.12	They cover every imaginable surface where there is sufficient moisture, and they live on and inside of other living things.
7.22.13	In the typical human body, prokaryotic cells outnumber human body cells by about ten to one.
7.22.14	They comprise the majority of living things in all ecosystems.
7.22.15	Some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable for most living things.
7.22.16	Prokaryotes recycle nutrients—essential substances (such as carbon and nitrogen)—and
7.22.17	they drive the evolution of new ecosystems, some of which are natural and others man-made.
7.22.18	Prokaryotes have been on Earth since long before multicellular life appeared.
7.22.19	Prokaryotes, the First Inhabitants of Earth
7.22.20	When and where did life begin?
7.22.21	What were the conditions on Earth when life began?
7.22.22	Prokaryotes were the first forms of life on Earth, and they existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared.
7.22.23	The Earth and its moon are thought to be about 4.54 billion years old.
7.22.24	This estimate is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with other substrate material from Earth and the moon.
7.22.25	Early Earth had a very different atmosphere (contained less molecular oxygen) than it does today and was subjected to strong radiation; thus, the first organisms would have flourished where they were more protected, such as in ocean depths or beneath the surface of the Earth.
7.22.26	At this time too, strong volcanic activity was common on Earth, so it is likely that these first organisms—the first prokaryotes—were adapted to very high temperatures.
7.22.27	Early Earth was prone to geological upheaval and volcanic eruption, and was subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation from the sun.
7.22.28	The first organisms were prokaryotes that could withstand these harsh conditions.
7.22.29	Microbial Mats Microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth; there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago.
7.22.30	A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes (Figure 22.2) that includes mostly bacteria, but also archaea.
7.22.31	Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick, and they typically grow where different types of materials interface, mostly on moist surfaces.
7.22.32	The various types of prokaryotes that comprise them carry out different metabolic pathways, and that is the reason for their various colors.
7.22.33	Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a glue-like sticky substance that they secrete called extracellular matrix.
7.22.34	The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents.
7.22.35	A hydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the Earth’s surface that releases geothermally heated water.
7.22.36	With the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source—sunlight—whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food.
7.22.37	This (a) microbial mat, about one meter in diameter, grows over a hydrothermal vent in the Pacific Ocean in a region known as the “Pacific Ring of Fire.
7.22.38	”
7.22.39	The mat helps retain microbial nutrients.
7.22.40	Chimneys such as the one indicated by the arrow allow gases to escape.
7.22.41	(b)
7.22.42	In this micrograph, bacteria are visualized using fluorescence microscopy.
7.22.43	Stromatolites Fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth.
7.22.44	A stromatolite is a sedimentary structure formed when minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat
7.22.45	(Figure 22.3).
7.22.46	Stromatolites form layered rocks made of carbonate or silicate.
7.22.47	Although most stromatolites are artifacts from the past, there are places on Earth where stromatolites are still forming.
7.22.48	For example, growing stromatolites have been found in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in San Diego County, California.
7.22.49	These living stromatolites are located in Shark Bay, Australia.
7.22.50	(b)
7.22.51	These fossilized stromatolites, found in Glacier National Park, Montana, are nearly 1.5 billion years old.
7.22.52	The Ancient Atmosphere Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth’s existence, the atmosphere was anoxic, meaning that there was no molecular oxygen.
7.22.53	Therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygen— anaerobic organisms—were able to live.
7.22.54	Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs, and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth.
7.22.55	Then, cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later.
7.22.56	Cyanobacteria (Figure 22.4) began the oxygenation of the atmosphere.
7.22.57	Increased atmospheric oxygen allowed the development of more efficient O2-utilizing catabolic pathways.
7.22.58	It also opened up the land to increased colonization, because some O2 is converted into O3 (ozone) and ozone effectively absorbs the ultraviolet light that would otherwise cause lethal mutations in DNA.
7.22.59	Ultimately, the increase in O2 concentrations allowed the evolution of other life forms.
7.22.60	This hot spring in Yellowstone National Park flows toward the foreground.
7.22.61	Cyanobacteria in the spring are green, and as water flows down the gradient, the intensity of the color increases as cell density increases.
7.22.62	The water is cooler at the edges of the stream than in the center, causing the edges to appear greener.
7.22.63	Microbes Are Adaptable: Life in Moderate and Extreme Environments
7.22.64	Some organisms have developed strategies that allow them to survive harsh conditions.
7.22.65	Prokaryotes thrive in a vast array of environments: Some grow in conditions that would seem very normal to us, whereas others are able to thrive and grow under conditions that would kill a plant or animal.
7.22.66	Almost all prokaryotes have a cell wall, a protective structure that allows them to survive in both hyper- and hypo-osmotic conditions.
7.22.67	Some soil bacteria are able to form endospores that resist heat and drought, thereby allowing the organism to survive until favorable conditions recur.
7.22.68	These adaptations, along with others, allow bacteria to be the most abundant life form in all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
7.22.69	Other bacteria and archaea are adapted to grow under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles, meaning “lovers of extremes.
7.22.70	”
7.22.71	Extremophiles have been found in all kinds of environments: the depth of the oceans, hot springs, the Artic and the Antarctic, in very dry places, deep inside Earth, in harsh chemical environments, and in high radiation environments (Figure 22.5), just to mention a few.
7.22.72	These organisms give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic drugs or have industrial applications.
7.22.73	Because they have specialized adaptations that allow them to live in extreme conditions, many extremophiles cannot survive in moderate environments.
7.22.74	There are many different groups of extremophiles: They are identified based on the conditions in which they grow best, and several habitats are extreme in multiple ways.
7.22.75	For example, a soda lake is both salty and alkaline, so organisms that live in a soda lake must be both alkaliphiles and halophiles (Table 22.1).
7.22.76	Other extremophiles, like radioresistant organisms, do not prefer an extreme environment (in this case, one with high levels of radiation), but have adapted to survive in it.
7.22.77	Deinococcus radiodurans, visualized in this false color transmission electron micrograph, is a prokaryote that can tolerate very high doses of ionizing radiation.
7.22.78	It has developed DNA repair mechanisms that allow it to reconstruct its chromosome even if it has been broken into hundreds of pieces by radiation or heat.
7.22.79	Prokaryotes in the Dead Sea
7.22.80	One example of a very harsh environment is the Dead Sea, a hypersaline basin that is located between Jordan and Israel.
7.22.81	Hypersaline environments are essentially concentrated seawater.
7.22.82	In the Dead Sea, the sodium concentration is 10 times higher than that of seawater, and the water contains high levels of magnesium (about 40 times higher than in seawater) that would be toxic to most living things.
7.22.83	Iron, calcium, and magnesium, elements that form divalent ions (Fe2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), produce what is commonly referred to as “hard” water.
7.22.84	Taken together, the high concentration of divalent cations, the acidic pH (6.0), and the intense solar radiation flux make the Dead Sea a unique, and uniquely hostile, ecosystem
7.22.85	[1] (Figure 22.6).
7.22.86	What sort of prokaryotes do we find in the Dead Sea?
7.22.87	The extremely salt-tolerant bacterial mats include Halobacterium, Haloferax volcanii (which is found in other locations, not only the Dead Sea), Halorubrum sodomense, and Halobaculum gomorrense, and the archaea Haloarcula marismortui, among others.
7.22.88	The Dead Sea is hypersaline.
7.22.89	Nevertheless, salt-tolerant bacteria thrive in this sea.
7.22.90	(b)
7.22.91	These halobacteria cells can form salt-tolerant bacterial mats.
7.22.92	Unculturable Prokaryotes and the Viable-but-Non-Culturable State Microbiologists typically grow prokaryotes in the laboratory using an appropriate culture medium containing all the nutrients needed by the target organism.
7.22.93	The medium can be liquid, broth, or solid.
7.22.94	After an incubation time at the right temperature, there should be evidence of microbial growth (Figure 22.7).
7.22.95	The process of culturing bacteria is complex and is one of the greatest discoveries of modern science.
7.22.96	German physician Robert Koch is credited with discovering the techniques for pure culture, including staining and using growth media.
7.22.97	His assistant Julius Petri invented the Petri dish whose use persists in today’s laboratories.
7.22.98	Koch worked primarily with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium that causes tuberculosis and developed postulates to identify disease-causing organisms that continue to be widely used in the medical community.
7.22.99	Koch’s postulates include that an organism can be identified as the cause of disease when it is present in all infected samples and absent in all healthy samples, and it is able to reproduce the infection after being cultured multiple times.
7.22.100	Today, cultures remain a primary diagnostic tool in medicine and other areas of molecular biology.
7.22.101	In these agar plates, the growth medium is supplemented with red blood cells.
7.22.102	Blood agar becomes transparent in the presence of hemolytic Streptococcus, which destroys red blood cells and is used to diagnose Streptococcus infections.
7.22.103	The plate on the left is inoculated with non-hemolytic Staphylococcus (large white colonies), and the plate on the right is inoculated with hemolytic Streptococcus (tiny clear colonies).
7.22.104	If you look closely at the right plate, you can see that the agar surrounding the bacteria has turned clear.
7.22.105	Some prokaryotes, however, cannot grow in a laboratory setting.
7.22.106	In fact, over 99 percent of bacteria and archaea are unculturable.
7.22.107	For the most part, this is due to a lack of knowledge as to what to feed these organisms and how to grow them; they have special requirements for growth that remain unknown to scientists, such as needing specific micronutrients, pH, temperature, pressure, co-factors, or co-metabolites.
7.22.108	Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside a host cell.
7.22.109	In other cases, culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions, even though the same organism could be cultured previously.
7.22.110	Those organisms that cannot be cultured but are not dead are in a viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state.
7.22.111	The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival.
7.22.112	The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are not completely understood.
7.22.113	In a process called resuscitation, the prokaryote can go back to “normal” life when environmental conditions improve.
7.22.114	Is the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes?
7.22.115	In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters are non-culturable.
7.22.116	It has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured under laboratory conditions.
7.22.117	If these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive?
7.22.118	Microbiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of DNA of prokaryotes, demonstrating their existence.
7.22.119	Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment in a process called amplification.
7.22.120	The Ecology of Biofilms Until a couple of decades ago, microbiologists used to think of prokaryotes as isolated entities living apart.
7.22.121	This model, however, does not reflect the true ecology of prokaryotes, most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact.
7.22.122	A biofilm is a microbial community (Figure 22.8) held together in a gummy-textured matrix that consists primarily of polysaccharides secreted by the organisms, together with some proteins and nucleic acids.
7.22.123	Biofilms grow attached to surfaces.
7.22.124	Some of the best-studied biofilms are composed of prokaryotes, although fungal biofilms have also been described as well as some composed of a mixture of fungi and bacteria.
7.22.125	Biofilms are present almost everywhere: they can cause the clogging of pipes and readily colonize surfaces in industrial settings.
7.22.126	In recent, large-scale outbreaks of bacterial contamination of food, biofilms have played a major role.
7.22.127	They also colonize household surfaces, such as kitchen counters, cutting boards, sinks, and toilets, as well as places on the human body, such as the surfaces of our teeth.
7.22.128	Interactions among the organisms that populate a biofilm, together with their protective exopolysaccharidic (EPS) environment, make these communities more robust than free-living, or planktonic, prokaryotes.
7.22.129	The sticky substance that holds bacteria together also excludes most antibiotics and disinfectants, making biofilm bacteria hardier than their planktonic counterparts.
7.22.130	Overall, biofilms are very difficult to destroy because they are resistant to many common forms of sterilization.
7.22.131	There are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
7.22.132	However, all cells have four common structures: the plasma membrane, which functions as a barrier for the cell and separates the cell from its environment; the cytoplasm, a jelly-like substance inside the cell; nucleic acids, the genetic material of the cell; and ribosomes, where protein synthesis takes place.
7.22.133	Prokaryotes come in various shapes, but many fall into three categories: cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod-shaped), and spirilli (spiral-shaped).
7.22.134	Prokaryotes fall into three basic categories based on their shape, visualized here using scanning electron microscopy: (a) cocci, or spherical (a pair is shown); (b) bacilli, or rod-shaped; and (c) spirilli, or spiral-shaped.
7.22.135	The Prokaryotic Cell Recall that prokaryotes (Figure 22.10) are unicellular organisms that lack organelles or other internal membrane-bound structures.
7.22.136	Therefore, they do not have a nucleus but instead generally have a single chromosome
7.22.137	—
7.22.138	a piece of circular, double-stranded DNA located in an area of the cell called the nucleoid.
7.22.139	Most prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the plasma membrane.
7.22.140	The features of a typical prokaryotic cell are shown.
7.22.141	Recall that prokaryotes are divided into two different domains, Bacteria and Archaea, which together with Eukarya, comprise the three domains of life.
7.22.142	Bacteria and Archaea are both prokaryotes but differ enough to be placed in separate domains.
7.22.143	An ancestor of modern Archaea is believed to have given rise to Eukarya, the third domain of life.
7.22.144	Archaeal and bacterial phyla are shown; the evolutionary relationship between these phyla is still open to debate.
7.22.145	The composition of the cell wall differs significantly between the domains Bacteria and Archaea.
7.22.146	The composition of their cell walls also differs from the eukaryotic cell walls found in plants (cellulose) or fungi and insects (chitin).
7.22.147	The cell wall functions as a protective layer, and it is responsible for the organism’s shape.
7.22.148	Some bacteria have an outer capsule outside the cell wall.
7.22.149	Other structures are present in some prokaryotic species, but not in others (Table 22.2).
7.22.150	For example, the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces, protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells, and makes pathogens more resistant to our immune responses.
7.22.151	Some species also have flagella (singular, flagellum) used for locomotion, and pili (singular, pilus) used for attachment to surfaces.
7.22.152	Plasmids, which consist of extrachromosomal DNA, are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea.
7.22.153	Phylum Proteobacteria is one of up to 52 bacteria phyla.
7.22.154	Proteobacteria is further subdivided into five classes, Alpha through Epsilon.
7.22.155	Chlamydia, Spirochetes, Cyanobacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria are described in this table.
7.22.156	Note that bacterial shape is not phylum-dependent; bacteria within a phylum may be cocci, rod-shaped, or spiral.
7.22.157	Archaea are separated into four phyla: the Korarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Nanoarchaeota.
7.22.158	The Plasma Membrane
7.22.159	The plasma membrane is a thin lipid bilayer (6 to 8 nanometers) that completely surrounds the cell and separates the inside from the outside.
7.22.160	Its selectively permeable nature keeps ions, proteins, and other molecules within the cell and prevents them from diffusing into the extracellular environment, while other molecules may move through the membrane.
7.22.161	Recall that the general structure of a cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer composed of two layers of lipid molecules.
7.22.162	In archaeal cell membranes, isoprene (phytanyl) chains linked to glycerol replace the fatty acids linked to glycerol in bacterial membranes.
7.22.163	Some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers.
7.22.164	Archaeal phospholipids differ from those found in Bacteria and Eukarya in two ways.
7.22.165	First, they have branched phytanyl sidechains instead of linear ones.
7.22.166	Second, an ether bond instead of an ester bond connects the lipid to the glycerol.
7.22.167	The Cell Wall
7.22.168	The cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes.
7.22.169	Therefore, the osmotic pressure within the cell is relatively high.
7.22.170	The cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some cells and gives them shape and rigidity.
7.22.171	It is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis (bursting due to increasing volume).
7.22.172	The chemical composition of the cell walls varies between archaea and bacteria, and also varies between bacterial species.
7.22.173	Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross-linked by unusual peptides containing both L- and D-amino acids including D-glutamic acid and D-alanine.
7.22.174	Proteins normally have only L-amino acids; as a consequence, many of our antibiotics work by mimicking D-amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell wall development.
7.22.175	There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan.
7.22.176	S-layer (surface layer) proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria.
7.22.177	Bacteria are divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative, based on their reaction to Gram staining.
7.22.178	Note that all Gram-positive bacteria belong to one phylum; bacteria in the other phyla (Proteobacteria, Chlamydias, Spirochetes, Cyanobacteria, and others) are Gram-negative.
7.22.179	The Gram staining method is named after its inventor, Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram (1853–1938).
7.22.180	The different bacterial responses to the staining procedure are ultimately due to cell wall structure.
7.22.181	Gram-positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative organisms (Figure 22.15).
7.22.182	Up to 90 percent of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances called teichoic acids.
7.22.183	Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to form lipoteichoic acids.
7.22.184	Lipoteichoic acids anchor the cell wall to the cell membrane.
7.22.185	Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall composed of a few layers of peptidoglycan (only 10 percent of the total cell wall), surrounded by an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoproteins.
7.22.186	This outer envelope is sometimes referred to as a second lipid bilayer.
7.22.187	The chemistry of this outer envelope is very different, however, from that of the typical lipid bilayer that forms plasma membranes.
7.22.188	Archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan.
7.22.189	There are four different types of Archaean cell walls.
7.22.190	One type is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan, which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the polysaccharide chain.
7.22.191	The other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or pure protein.
7.22.192	Reproduction Reproduction in prokaryotes is asexual and usually takes place by binary fission.
7.22.193	Recall that the DNA of a prokaryote exists as a single, circular chromosome.
7.22.194	Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis.
7.22.195	Rather the chromosome is replicated and the two resulting copies separate from one another, due to the growth of the cell.
7.22.196	The prokaryote, now enlarged, is pinched inward at its equator and the two resulting cells, which are clones, separate.
7.22.197	Binary fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic recombination or genetic diversity, but prokaryotes can share genes by three other mechanisms.
7.22.198	In transformation, the prokaryote takes in DNA found in its environment that is shed by other prokaryotes.
7.22.199	If a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own chromosome, it too may become pathogenic.
7.22.200	In transduction, bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, sometimes also move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from one bacterium to another.
7.22.201	Transduction results in a recombinant organism.
7.22.202	Archaea are not affected by bacteriophages but instead have their own viruses that translocate genetic material from one individual to another.
7.22.203	In conjugation, DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means of a pilus, which brings the organisms into contact with one another.
7.22.204	The DNA transferred can be in the form of a plasmid or as a hybrid, containing both plasmid and chromosomal DNA.
7.22.205	These three processes of DNA exchange are shown in Figure 22.17.
7.22.206	Reproduction can be very rapid: a few minutes for some species.
7.22.207	This short generation time coupled with mechanisms of genetic recombination and high rates of mutation result in the rapid evolution of prokaryotes, allowing them to respond to environmental changes (such as the introduction of an antibiotic) very quickly.
7.22.208	Besides binary fission, there are three other mechanisms by which prokaryotes can exchange DNA.
7.22.209	In (a) transformation, the cell takes up prokaryotic DNA directly from the environment.
7.22.210	The DNA may remain separate as plasmid DNA or be incorporated into the host genome.
7.22.211	In (b) transduction, a bacteriophage injects DNA into the cell that contains a small fragment of DNA from a different prokaryote.
7.22.212	In (c) conjugation, DNA is transferred from one cell to another via a mating bridge that connects the two cells after the sex pilus draws the two bacteria close enough to form the bridge.
7.22.213	Prokaryotes are metabolically diverse organisms.
7.22.214	There are many different environments on Earth with various energy and carbon sources, and variable conditions.
7.22.215	Prokaryotes have been able to live in every environment by using whatever energy and carbon sources are available.
7.22.216	Prokaryotes fill many niches on Earth, including being involved in nutrient cycles such as nitrogen and carbon cycles, decomposing dead organisms, and thriving inside living organisms, including humans.
7.22.217	The very broad range of environments that prokaryotes occupy is possible because they have diverse metabolic processes.
7.22.218	Needs of Prokaryotes
7.22.219	The diverse environments and ecosystems on Earth have a wide range of conditions in terms of temperature, available nutrients, acidity, salinity, and energy sources.
7.22.220	Prokaryotes are very well equipped to make their living out of a vast array of nutrients and conditions.
7.22.221	To live, prokaryotes need a source of energy, a source of carbon, and some additional nutrients.
7.22.222	Macronutrients Cells are essentially a well-organized assemblage of macromolecules and water.
7.22.223	Recall that macromolecules are produced by the polymerization of smaller units called monomers.
7.22.224	For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life, they need certain substances, collectively called nutrients.
7.22.225	When prokaryotes grow in nature, they obtain their nutrients from the environment.
7.22.226	Nutrients that are required in large amounts are called macronutrients, whereas those required in smaller or trace amounts are called micronutrients.
7.22.227	Just a handful of elements are considered macronutrients—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
7.22.228	(A mnemonic for remembering these elements is the acronym CHONPS.)
7.22.229	Why are these macronutrients needed in large amounts?
7.22.230	They are the components of organic compounds in cells, including water.
7.22.231	Carbon is the major element in all macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and many other compounds.
7.22.232	Carbon accounts for about 50 percent of the composition of the cell.
7.22.233	Nitrogen represents 12 percent of the total dry weight of a typical cell and is a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents.
7.22.234	Most of the nitrogen available in nature is either atmospheric nitrogen (N2) or another inorganic form.
7.22.235	Diatomic (N2) nitrogen, however, can be converted into an organic form only by certain organisms, called nitrogen-fixing organisms.
7.22.236	Both hydrogen and oxygen are part of many organic compounds and of water.
7.22.237	Phosphorus is required by all organisms for the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids.
7.22.238	Sulfur is part of the structure of some amino acids such as cysteine and methionine, and is also present in several vitamins and coenzymes.
7.22.239	Other important macronutrients are potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na).
7.22.240	Although these elements are required in smaller amounts, they are very important for the structure and function of the prokaryotic cell.
7.22.241	Micronutrients
7.22.242	In addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements in small amounts.
7.22.243	These are referred to as micronutrients or trace elements.
7.22.244	For example, iron is necessary for the function of the cytochromes involved in electron-transport reactions.
7.22.245	Some prokaryotes require other elements—such as boron (B), chromium (Cr), and manganese (Mn)—primarily as enzyme cofactors.
7.22.246	The Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Energy Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules.
7.22.247	Phototrophs (or phototrophic organisms) obtain their energy from sunlight.
7.22.248	Chemotrophs (or chemosynthetic organisms) obtain their energy from chemical compounds.
7.22.249	Chemotrophs that can use organic compounds as energy sources are called chemoorganotrophs.
7.22.250	Those that can also use inorganic compounds as energy sources are called chemolitotrophs.
7.22.251	The Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Carbon Prokaryotes not only can use different sources of energy but also different sources of carbon compounds.
7.22.252	Recall that organisms that are able to fix inorganic carbon are called autotrophs.
7.22.253	Autotrophic prokaryotes synthesize organic molecules from carbon dioxide.
7.22.254	In contrast, heterotrophic prokaryotes obtain carbon from organic compounds.
7.22.255	To make the picture more complex, the terms that describe how prokaryotes obtain energy and carbon can be combined.
7.22.256	Thus, photoautotrophs use energy from sunlight, and carbon from carbon dioxide and water, whereas chemoheterotrophs obtain energy and carbon from an organic chemical source.
7.22.257	Chemolitoautotrophs obtain their energy from inorganic compounds, and they build their complex molecules from carbon dioxide.
7.22.258	The table below (Table 22.3) summarizes carbon and energy sources in prokaryotes.
7.22.259	Role of Prokaryotes in Ecosystems Prokaryotes are ubiquitous: There is no niche or ecosystem in which they are not present.
7.22.260	Prokaryotes play many roles in the environments they occupy.
7.22.261	The roles they play in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are vital to life on Earth.
7.22.262	Prokaryotes and the Carbon Cycle Carbon is one of the most important macronutrients, and prokaryotes play an important role in the carbon cycle (Figure 22.18).
7.22.263	Carbon is cycled through Earth’s major reservoirs: land, the atmosphere, aquatic environments, sediments and rocks, and biomass.
7.22.264	The movement of carbon is via carbon dioxide, which is removed from the atmosphere by land plants and marine prokaryotes, and is returned to the atmosphere via the respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms, including prokaryotes, fungi, and animals.
7.22.265	Although the largest carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments, that carbon is not readily available.
7.22.266	A large amount of available carbon is found in land plants.
7.22.267	Plants, which are producers, use carbon dioxide from the air to synthesize carbon compounds.
7.22.268	Related to this, one very significant source of carbon compounds is humus, which is a mixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that have resisted decomposition.
7.22.269	Consumers such as animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
7.22.270	Then, bacteria and fungi, collectively called decomposers, carry out the breakdown (decomposition) of plants and animals and their organic compounds.
7.22.271	The most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead material (dead animals, plants, and humus) that undergo respiration.
7.22.272	In aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments, there is another carbon cycle taking place.
7.22.273	In this case, the cycle is based on one-carbon compounds.
7.22.274	In anoxic sediments, prokaryotes, mostly archaea, produce methane (CH4).
7.22.275	This methane moves into the zone above the sediment, which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria called methane oxidizers that oxidize methane to carbon dioxide, which then returns to the atmosphere.
7.22.276	Prokaryotes play a significant role in continuously moving carbon through the biosphere.
7.22.277	Prokaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle Nitrogen is a very important element for life because it is part of proteins and nucleic acids.
7.22.278	It is a macronutrient, and in nature, it is recycled from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrate, nitrite, and nitrogen gas by myriad processes, many of which are carried out only by prokaryotes.
7.22.279	As illustrated in Figure 22.19, prokaryotes are key to the nitrogen cycle.
7.22.280	The largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air, but this nitrogen is not usable by plants, which are primary producers.
7.22.281	Gaseous nitrogen is transformed, or “fixed” into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation.
7.22.282	Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms.
7.22.283	Another source of ammonia is ammonification, the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic compounds.
7.22.284	Ammonia released to the atmosphere, however, represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released; the rest is as N2 and N2O. Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes, yielding N2 as the final product.
7.22.285	Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate.
7.22.286	Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas, Nitrobacter, and Nitrospira.
7.22.287	The bacteria performs the reverse process, the reduction of nitrate from the soils to gaseous compounds such as N2O, NO, and N2, a process called denitrification.
7.22.288	Devastating pathogen-borne diseases and plagues, both viral and bacterial in nature, have affected humans since the beginning of human history.
7.22.289	The true cause of these diseases was not understood at the time, and some people thought that diseases were a spiritual punishment.
7.22.290	Over time, people came to realize that staying apart from afflicted persons, and disposing of the corpses and personal belongings of victims of illness, reduced their own chances of getting sick.
7.22.291	Epidemiologists study how diseases affect a population.
7.22.292	An epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time.
7.22.293	A pandemic is a widespread, usually worldwide, epidemic.
7.22.294	An endemic disease is a disease that is constantly present, usually at low incidence, in a population.
7.22.295	Long History of Bacterial Disease There are records about infectious diseases as far back as 3000 B.C.
7.22.296	A number of significant pandemics caused by bacteria have been documented over several hundred years.
7.22.297	Some of the most memorable pandemics led to the decline of cities and nations.
7.22.298	In the 21st century, infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide, despite advances made in medical research and treatments in recent decades.
7.22.299	A disease spreads when the pathogen that causes it is passed from one person to another.
7.22.300	For a pathogen to cause disease, it must be able to reproduce in the host’s body and damage the host in some way.
7.22.301	The Plague of Athens
7.22.302	In 430 B.C., the Plague of Athens killed one-quarter of the Athenian troops that were fighting in the great Peloponnesian War and weakened Athens’ dominance and power.
7.22.303	The plague impacted people living in overcrowded Athens as well as troops aboard ships that had to return to Athens.
7.22.304	The source of the plague may have been identified recently when researchers from the University of Athens were able to use DNA from teeth recovered from a mass grave.
7.22.305	The scientists identified nucleotide sequences from a pathogenic bacterium, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Figure 22.20), which causes typhoid fever.
7.22.306	[3] This disease is commonly seen in overcrowded areas and has caused epidemics throughout recorded history.
7.22.307	Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the causative agent of Typhoid fever, is a Gram-negative, rodshaped gamma protobacterium.
7.22.308	Typhoid fever, which is spread through feces, causes intestinal hemorrhage, high fever, delirium and dehydration.
7.22.309	Today, between 16 and 33 million cases of this re-emerging disease occur annually, resulting in over 200,000 deaths.
7.22.310	Carriers of the disease can be asymptomatic.
7.22.311	In a famous case in the early 1900s, a cook named Mary Mallon unknowingly spread the disease to over fifty people, three of whom died.
7.22.312	Other Salmonella serotypes cause food poisoning.
7.22.313	Bubonic Plagues From 541 to 750, an outbreak of what was likely a bubonic plague (the Plague of Justinian), eliminated one-quarter to onehalf of the human population in the eastern Mediterranean region.
7.22.314	The population in Europe dropped by 50 percent during this outbreak.
7.22.315	Bubonic plague would strike Europe more than once.
7.22.316	One of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death (1346 to 1361) that is believed to have been another outbreak of bubonic plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis.
7.22.317	It is thought to have originated initially in China and spread along the Silk Road, a network of land and sea trade routes, to the Mediterranean region and Europe, carried by rat fleas living on black rats that were always present on ships.
7.22.318	The Black Death reduced the world’s population from an estimated 450 million to about 350 to 375 million.
7.22.319	Bubonic plague struck London hard again in the mid-1600s (Figure 22.21).
7.22.320	In modern times, approximately 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague arise globally each year.
7.22.321	Although contracting bubonic plague before antibiotics meant almost certain death, the bacterium responds to several types of modern antibiotics, and mortality rates from plague are now very low.
7.22.322	The (a) Great Plague of London killed an estimated 200,000 people, or about twenty percent of the city’s population.
7.22.323	The causative agent, the (b) bacterium Yersinia pestis, is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium from the class Gamma Proteobacteria.
7.22.324	The disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected flea, which is infected by a rodent.
7.22.325	Symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, fever, seizure, vomiting of blood, and (c) gangrene Migration of Diseases to New Populations
7.22.326	Over the centuries, Europeans tended to develop genetic immunity to endemic infectious diseases, but when European conquerors reached the western hemisphere, they brought with them disease-causing bacteria and viruses, which triggered epidemics that completely devastated populations of Native Americans, who had no natural resistance to many European diseases.
7.22.327	It has been estimated that up to 90 percent of Native Americans died from infectious diseases after the arrival of Europeans, making conquest of the New World a foregone conclusion.
7.22.328	Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases
7.22.329	The distribution of a particular disease is dynamic.
7.22.330	Therefore, changes in the environment, the pathogen, or the host population can dramatically impact the spread of a disease.
7.22.331	According to the World Health Organization (WHO) an emerging disease (Figure 22.22) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time, or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range.
7.22.332	This definition also includes re-emerging diseases that were previously under control.
7.22.333	Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases, zoonoses, diseases that primarily infect animals and are transmitted to humans; some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial origin.
7.22.334	Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re-emerging in some regions, and necrotizing fasciitis (commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons.
7.22.335	The map shows regions where bacterial diseases are emerging or reemerging.
7.22.336	Some of the present emerging diseases are not actually new, but are diseases that were catastrophic in the past (Figure 22.23).
7.22.337	They devastated populations and became dormant for a while, just to come back, sometimes more virulent than before, as was the case with bubonic plague.
7.22.338	Other diseases, like tuberculosis, were never eradicated but were under control in some regions of the world until coming back, mostly in urban centers with high concentrations of immunocompromised people.
7.22.339	The WHO has identified certain diseases whose worldwide re-emergence should be monitored.
7.22.340	Among these are two viral diseases (dengue fever and yellow fever), and three bacterial diseases (diphtheria, cholera, and bubonic plague).
7.22.341	The war against infectious diseases has no foreseeable end.
7.22.342	Lyme disease often, but not always, results in (a) a characteristic bullseye rash.
7.22.343	The disease is caused by a (b) Gram-negative spirochete bacterium of the genus Borrelia.
7.22.344	The bacteria (c) infect ticks, which in turns infect mice.
7.22.345	Deer are the preferred secondary host, but the ticks also may feed on humans.
7.22.346	Untreated, the disease causes chronic disorders in the nervous system, eyes, joints, and heart.
7.22.347	The disease is named after Lyme, Connecticut, where an outbreak occurred in 1995 and has subsequently spread.
7.22.348	The disease is not new, however.
7.22.349	Genetic evidence suggests that Ötzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old mummy found in the Alps, was infected with Borrelia.
7.22.350	Biofilms and Disease Recall that biofilms are microbial communities that are very difficult to destroy.
7.22.351	They are responsible for diseases such as infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, Legionnaires’ disease, and otitis media.
7.22.352	They produce dental plaque and colonize catheters, prostheses, transcutaneous and orthopedic devices, contact lenses, and internal devices such as pacemakers.
7.22.353	They also form in open wounds and burned tissue.
7.22.354	In healthcare environments, biofilms grow on hemodialysis machines, mechanical ventilators, shunts, and other medical equipment.
7.22.355	In fact, 65 percent of all infections acquired in the hospital (nosocomial infections) are attributed to biofilms.
7.22.356	Biofilms are also related to diseases contracted from food because they colonize the surfaces of vegetable leaves and meat, as well as food-processing equipment that isn’t adequately cleaned.
7.22.357	Biofilm infections develop gradually; sometimes, they do not cause symptoms immediately.
7.22.358	They are rarely resolved by host defense mechanisms.
7.22.359	Once an infection by a biofilm is established, it is very difficult to eradicate, because biofilms tend to be resistant to most of the methods used to control microbial growth, including antibiotics.
7.22.360	Biofilms respond poorly or only temporarily to antibiotics; it has been said that they can resist up to 1,000 times the antibiotic concentrations used to kill the same bacteria when they are free-living or planktonic.
7.22.361	An antibiotic dose that large would harm the patient; therefore, scientists are working on new ways to get rid of biofilms.
7.22.362	Antibiotics:
7.22.363	Are We Facing a Crisis?
7.22.364	The word antibiotic comes from the Greek anti meaning “against” and bios meaning “life.
7.22.365	”
7.22.366	An antibiotic is a chemical, produced either by microbes or synthetically, that is hostile to the growth of other organisms.
7.22.367	Today’s news and media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis.
7.22.368	Are the antibiotics that easily treated bacterial infections in the past becoming obsolete?
7.22.369	Are there new “superbugs”—bacteria that have evolved to become more resistant to our arsenal of antibiotics?
7.22.370	Is this the beginning of the end of antibiotics?
7.22.371	All these questions challenge the healthcare community.
7.22.372	One of the main causes of resistant bacteria is the abuse of antibiotics.
7.22.373	The imprudent and excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in the natural selection of resistant forms of bacteria.
7.22.374	The antibiotic kills most of the infecting bacteria, and therefore only the resistant forms remain.
7.22.375	These resistant forms reproduce, resulting in an increase in the proportion of resistant forms over non-resistant ones.
7.22.376	Another major misuse of antibiotics is in patients with colds or the flu, for which antibiotics are useless.
7.22.377	Another problem is the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock.
7.22.378	The routine use of antibiotics in animal feed promotes bacterial resistance as well.
7.22.379	In the United States, 70 percent of the antibiotics produced are fed to animals.
7.22.380	These antibiotics are given to livestock in low doses, which maximize the probability of resistance developing, and these resistant bacteria are readily transferred to humans.
7.22.381	One of the Superbugs: MRSA The imprudent use of antibiotics has paved the way for bacteria to expand populations of resistant forms.
7.22.382	For example, Staphylococcus aureus, often called “staph,” is a common bacterium that can live in the human body and is usually easily treated with antibiotics.
7.22.383	A very dangerous strain, however, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has made the news over the past few years (Figure 22.24).
7.22.384	This strain is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics, including methicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, and oxacillin.
7.22.385	MRSA can cause infections of the skin, but it can also infect the bloodstream, lungs, urinary tract, or sites of injury.
7.22.386	While MRSA infections are common among people in healthcare facilities, they have also appeared in healthy people who haven’t been hospitalized but who live or work in tight populations (like military personnel and prisoners).
7.22.387	Researchers have expressed concern about the way this latter source of MRSA targets a much younger population than those residing in care facilities.
7.22.388	The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that, among MRSA-afflicted persons in healthcare facilities, the average age is 68, whereas people with “community-associated MRSA” ( CA-MRSA) have an average age of 23.
7.22.389	This scanning electron micrograph shows methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, commonly known as MRSA.
7.22.390	S. aureus is not always pathogenic, but can cause diseases such as food poisoning and skin and respiratory infections.
7.22.391	In summary, the medical community is facing an antibiotic crisis.
7.22.392	Some scientists believe that after years of being protected from bacterial infections by antibiotics, we may be returning to a time in which a simple bacterial infection could again devastate the human population.
7.22.393	Researchers are developing new antibiotics, but it takes many years to of research and clinical trials, plus financial investments in the millions of dollars, to generate an effective and approved drug.
7.22.394	Foodborne Diseases Prokaryotes are everywhere: They readily colonize the surface of any type of material, and food is not an exception.
7.22.395	Most of the time, prokaryotes colonize food and food-processing equipment in the form of a biofilm.
7.22.396	Outbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common.
7.22.397	A foodborne disease (colloquially called “food poisoning”) is an illness resulting from the consumption the pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or other parasites that contaminate food.
7.22.398	Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that “76 million people get sick, more than 300,000 are hospitalized, and 5,000 Americans die each year from foodborne illness.
7.22.399	”
7.22.400	The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time.
7.22.401	In the past, it was relatively common to hear about sporadic cases of botulism, the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum.
7.22.402	Some of the most common sources for this bacterium were non-acidic canned foods, homemade pickles, and processed meat and sausages.
7.22.403	The can, jar, or package created a suitable anaerobic environment where Clostridium could grow.
7.22.404	Proper sterilization and canning procedures have reduced the incidence of this disease.
7.22.405	While people may tend to think of foodborne illnesses as associated with animal-based foods, most cases are now linked to produce.
7.22.406	There have been serious, produce-related outbreaks associated with raw spinach in the United States and with vegetable sprouts in Germany, and these types of outbreaks have become more common.
7.22.407	The raw spinach outbreak in 2006 was produced by the bacterium E. coli serotype O157:H7.
7.22.408	A serotype is a strain of bacteria that carries a set of similar antigens on its cell surface, and there are often many different serotypes of a bacterial species.
7.22.409	Most E. coli are not particularly dangerous to humans, but serotype O157:H7 can cause bloody diarrhea and is potentially fatal.
7.22.410	All types of food can potentially be contaminated with bacteria.
7.22.411	Recent outbreaks of Salmonella reported by the CDC occurred in foods as diverse as peanut butter, alfalfa sprouts, and eggs.
7.22.412	A deadly outbreak in Germany in 2010 was caused by E. coli contamination of vegetable sprouts (Figure 22.25).
7.22.413	The strain that caused the outbreak was found to be a new serotype not previously involved in other outbreaks, which indicates that E. coli is continuously evolving.
7.22.414	Vegetable sprouts grown at an organic farm were the cause of an (b) E. coli outbreak that killed 32 people and sickened 3,800 in Germany in 2011.
7.22.415	The strain responsible, E. coli O104:H4, produces Shiga toxin, a substance that inhibits protein synthesis in the host cell.
7.22.416	The toxin (c) destroys red blood cells resulting in bloody diarrhea.
7.22.417	Deformed red blood cells clog the capillaries of the kidney, which can lead to kidney failure, as happened to 845 patients in the 2011 outbreak.
7.22.418	Kidney failure is usually reversible, but some patients experience kidney problems years later.
7.22.419	Not all prokaryotes are pathogenic.
7.22.420	On the contrary, pathogens represent only a very small percentage of the diversity of the microbial world.
7.22.421	In fact, our life would not be possible without prokaryotes.
7.22.422	Just think about the role of prokaryotes in biogeochemical cycles.
7.22.423	Cooperation between Bacteria and Eukaryotes:
7.22.424	Nitrogen Fixation Nitrogen is a very important element to living things, because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are the building blocks of nucleic acids and proteins, respectively.
7.22.425	Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial ecosystems, with atmospheric nitrogen, N2, providing the largest pool of available nitrogen.
7.22.426	However, eukaryotes cannot use atmospheric, gaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules.
7.22.427	Fortunately, nitrogen can be “fixed,” meaning it is converted into ammonia (NH3) either biologically or abiotically.
7.22.428	Abiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of lightning or by industrial processes.
7.22.429	Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes: soil bacteria, cyanobacteria, and Frankia spp.
7.22.430	(filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder, bayberry, and sweet fern).
7.22.431	After photosynthesis, BNF is the second most important biological process on Earth.
7.22.432	The equation representing the process is as follows N2 + 16ATP + 8e−
7.22.433	+
7.22.434	8H+
7.22.435	→
7.22.436	2NH3 + 16ADP + 16Pi
7.22.437	+ H2 where Pi stands for inorganic phosphate.
7.22.438	The total fixed nitrogen through BNF is about 100 to 180 million metric tons per year.
7.22.439	Biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture.
7.22.440	Cyanobacteria are the most important nitrogen fixers in aquatic environments.
7.22.441	In soil, members of the genus Clostridium are examples of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
7.22.442	Other bacteria live symbiotically with legume plants, providing the most important source of BNF.
7.22.443	Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free-living organisms by a factor of 10.
7.22.444	Soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules, specialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs (Figure 22.27).
7.22.445	Nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes nitrogen, is inactivated by oxygen, so the nodule provides an oxygen-free area for nitrogen fixation to take place.
7.22.446	This process provides a natural and inexpensive plant fertilizer, as it reduces atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, which is easily usable by plants.
7.22.447	The use of legumes is an excellent alternative to chemical fertilization and is of special interest to sustainable agriculture, which seeks to minimize the use of chemicals and conserve natural resources.
7.22.448	Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen: the atmosphere.
7.22.449	Bacteria benefit from using photosynthates (carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis) from the plant and having a protected niche.
7.22.450	Additionally, the soil benefits from being naturally fertilized.
7.22.451	Therefore, the use of rhizobia as biofertilizers is a sustainable practice.
7.22.452	Why are legumes so important?
7.22.453	Some, like soybeans, are key sources of agricultural protein.
7.22.454	Some of the most important grain legumes are soybean, peanuts, peas, chickpeas, and beans.
7.22.455	Other legumes, such as alfalfa, are used to feed cattle.
7.22.456	Soybean (Glycine max) is a legume that interacts symbiotically with the soil bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum to form specialized structures on the roots called nodules where nitrogen fixation occurs.
7.22.457	Early Biotechnology:
7.22.458	Cheese, Bread, Wine, Beer, and Yogurt
7.22.459	According to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, biotechnology is “any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use.
7.22.460	"
7.22.461	[5] The concept of “specific use” involves some sort of commercial application.
7.22.462	Genetic engineering, artificial selection, antibiotic production, and cell culture are current topics of study in biotechnology.
7.22.463	However, humans have used prokaryotes before the term biotechnology was even coined.
7.22.464	In addition, some of the goods and services are as simple as cheese, bread, wine, beer, and yogurt, which employ both bacteria and other microbes, such as yeast, a fungus.
7.22.465	Some of the products derived from the use of prokaryotes in early biotechnology include (a) cheese, (b) wine, (c) beer and bread, and (d) yogurt.
7.22.466	Cheese production began around 4,000–7,000 years ago when humans began to breed animals and process their milk.
7.22.467	Fermentation in this case preserves nutrients: Milk will spoil relatively quickly, but when processed as cheese, it is more stable.
7.22.468	As for beer, the oldest records of brewing are about 6,000 years old and refer to the Sumerians.
7.22.469	Evidence indicates that the Sumerians discovered fermentation by chance.
7.22.470	Wine has been produced for about 4,500 years, and evidence suggests that cultured milk products, like yogurt, have existed for at least 4,000 years.
7.22.471	Using Prokaryotes to Clean up Our Planet: Bioremediation Microbial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes (or microbial metabolism) to remove pollutants.
7.22.472	Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface.
7.22.473	Certain toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation.
7.22.474	The reduction of SeO4 -2 to SeO3 -2 and to Se0 (metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium ions from water.
7.22.475	Mercury is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation.
7.22.476	As an active ingredient of some pesticides, mercury is used in industry and is also a by-product of certain processes, such as battery production.
7.22.477	Methyl mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments, but it is highly toxic because it accumulates in living tissues.
7.22.478	Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms.
7.22.479	These bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can convert Hg+2 into Hg0, which is nontoxic to humans.
7.22.480	One of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil spills.
7.22.481	The importance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years, such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989)
7.22.482	(Figure 22.29), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into the Mediterranean from a Lebanon power plant (2006), and more recently, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (2010).
7.22.483	To clean up these spills, bioremediation is promoted by the addition of inorganic nutrients that help bacteria to grow.
7.22.484	Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on hydrocarbons in the oil droplet, breaking down the hydrocarbons.
7.22.485	Some species, such as Alcanivorax borkumensis, produce surfactants that solubilize the oil, whereas other bacteria degrade the oil into carbon dioxide.
7.22.486	In the case of oil spills in the ocean, ongoing, natural bioremediation tends to occur, inasmuch as there are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill.
7.22.487	In addition to naturally occurring oil-degrading bacteria, humans select and engineer bacteria that possess the same capability with increased efficacy and spectrum of hydrocarbon compounds that can be processed.
7.22.488	Under ideal conditions, it has been reported that up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile components in oil can be degraded within one year of the spill.
7.22.489	Other oil fractions containing aromatic and highly branched hydrocarbon chains are more difficult to remove and remain in the environment for longer periods of time.
7.22.490	Cleaning up oil after the Valdez spill in Alaska, workers hosed oil from beaches and then used a floating boom to corral the oil, which was finally skimmed from the water surface.
7.22.491	Some species of bacteria are able to solubilize and degrade the oil.
7.22.492	(b) One of the most catastrophic consequences of oil spills is the damage to fauna.
7.23.0	Protists range from the microscopic, single-celled (a) Acanthocystis turfacea and the (b) ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, both visualized here using light microscopy, to the enormous, multicellular (c) kelps (Chromalveolata) that extend for hundreds of feet in underwater “forests.
7.23.1	”
7.23.2	Humans have been familiar with macroscopic organisms (organisms big enough to see with the unaided eye) since before there was a written history, and it is likely that most cultures distinguished between animals and land plants, and most probably included the macroscopic fungi as plants.
7.23.3	Therefore, it became an interesting challenge to deal with the world of microorganisms once microscopes were developed a few centuries ago.
7.23.4	Many different naming schemes were used over the last couple of centuries, but it has become the most common practice to refer to eukaryotes that are not land plants, animals, or fungi as protists.
7.23.5	This name was first suggested by Ernst Haeckel in the late nineteenth century.
7.23.6	It has been applied in many contexts and has been formally used to represent a kingdom-level taxon called Protista.
7.23.7	However, many modern systematists (biologists who study the relationships among organisms) are beginning to shy away from the idea of formal ranks such as kingdom and phylum.
7.23.8	Instead, they are naming taxa as groups of organisms thought to include all the descendants of a last common ancestor (monophyletic group).
7.23.9	During the past two decades, the field of molecular genetics has demonstrated that some protists are more related to animals, plants, or fungi than they are to other protists.
7.23.10	Therefore, not including animals, plants and fungi make the kingdom Protista a paraphyletic group, or one that does not include all descendents of its common ancestor.
7.23.11	For this reason, protist lineages originally classified into the kingdom Protista continue to be examined and debated.
7.23.12	In the meantime, the term “protist” still is used informally to describe this tremendously diverse group of eukaryotes.
7.23.13	Most protists are microscopic, unicellular organisms that are abundant in soil, freshwater, brackish, and marine environments.
7.23.14	They are also common in the digestive tracts of animals and in the vascular tissues of plants.
7.23.15	Others invade the cells of other protists, animals, and plants.
7.23.16	Not all protists are microscopic.
7.23.17	Some have huge, macroscopic cells, such as the plasmodia (giant amoebae) of myxomycete slime molds or the marine green alga Caulerpa, which can have single cells that can be several meters in size.
7.23.18	Some protists are multicellular, such as the red, green, and brown seaweeds.
7.23.19	It is among the protists that one finds the wealth of ways that organisms can grow.
7.23.20	Living things fall into three large groups: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.
7.23.21	The first two have prokaryotic cells, and the third contains all eukaryotes.
7.23.22	A relatively sparse fossil record is available to help discern what the first members of each of these lineages looked like, so it is possible that all the events that led to the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes will remain unknown.
7.23.23	However, comparative biology of extant organisms and the limited fossil record provide some insight into the history of Eukarya.
7.23.24	The earliest fossils found appear to be Bacteria, most likely cyanobacteria.
7.23.25	They are about 3.5 billion years old and are recognizable because of their relatively complex structure and, for prokaryotes, relatively large cells.
7.23.26	Most other prokaryotes have small cells, 1 or 2 μm in size, and would be difficult to pick out as fossils.
7.23.27	Most living eukaryotes have cells measuring 10 μm or greater.
7.23.28	Structures this size, which might be fossils, appear in the geological record about 2.1 billion years ago.
7.23.29	Characteristics of Eukaryotes Data from these fossils have led comparative biologists to the conclusion that living eukaryotes are all descendants of a single common ancestor.
7.23.30	Mapping the characteristics found in all major groups of eukaryotes reveals that the following characteristics must have been present in the last common ancestor, because these characteristics are present in at least some of the members of each major lineage.
7.23.31	1.
7.23.32	Cells with nuclei surrounded by a nuclear envelope with nuclear pores.
7.23.33	This is the single characteristic that is both necessary and sufficient to define an organism as a eukaryote.
7.23.34	All extant eukaryotes have cells with nuclei.
7.23.35	2.
7.23.36	Mitochondria.
7.23.37	Some extant eukaryotes have very reduced remnants of mitochondria in their cells, whereas other members of their lineages have “typical” mitochondria.
7.23.38	3.
7.23.39	A cytoskeleton containing the structural and motility components called actin microfilaments and microtubules.
7.23.40	All extant eukaryotes have these cytoskeletal elements.
7.23.41	4.
7.23.42	Flagella and cilia, organelles associated with cell motility.
7.23.43	Some extant eukaryotes lack flagella and/or cilia, but they are descended from ancestors that possessed them.
7.23.44	5.
7.23.45	Chromosomes, each consisting of a linear DNA molecule coiled around basic (alkaline) proteins called histones.
7.23.46	The few eukaryotes with chromosomes lacking histones clearly evolved from ancestors that had them.
7.23.47	6.
7.23.48	Mitosis, a process of nuclear division wherein replicated chromosomes are divided and separated using elements of the cytoskeleton.
7.23.49	Mitosis is universally present in eukaryotes.
7.23.50	7.
7.23.51	Sex, a process of genetic recombination unique to eukaryotes in which diploid nuclei at one stage of the life cycle undergo meiosis to yield haploid nuclei and subsequent karyogamy, a stage where two haploid nuclei fuse together to create a diploid zygote nucleus.
7.23.52	8.
7.23.53	Members of all major lineages have cell walls, and it might be reasonable to conclude that the last common ancestor could make cell walls during some stage of its life cycle.
7.23.54	However, not enough is known about eukaryotes’ cell walls and their development to know how much homology exists among them.
7.23.55	If the last common ancestor could make cell walls, it is clear that this ability must have been lost in many groups.
7.23.56	Endosymbiosis and the Evolution of Eukaryotes
7.23.57	In order to understand eukaryotic organisms fully, it is necessary to understand that all extant eukaryotes are descendants of a chimeric organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell(s) of an alpha-proteobacterium that “took up residence” inside it.
7.23.58	This major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known as endosymbiosis, one cell engulfing another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit.
7.23.59	Over many generations, a symbiotic relationship can result in two organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own.
7.23.60	Endosymbiotic events likely contributed to the origin of the last common ancestor of today’s eukaryotes and to later diversification in certain lineages of eukaryotes (Figure 23.5).
7.23.61	Before explaining this further, it is necessary to consider metabolism in prokaryotes.
7.23.62	Prokaryotic Metabolism
7.23.63	Many important metabolic processes arose in prokaryotes, and some of these, such as nitrogen fixation, are never found in eukaryotes.
7.23.64	The process of aerobic respiration is found in all major lineages of eukaryotes, and it is localized in the mitochondria.
7.23.65	Aerobic respiration is also found in many lineages of prokaryotes, but it is not present in all of them, and many forms of evidence suggest that such anaerobic prokaryotes never carried out aerobic respiration nor did their ancestors.
7.23.66	While today’s atmosphere is about one-fifth molecular oxygen (O2), geological evidence shows that it originally lacked O2.
7.23.67	Without oxygen, aerobic respiration would not be expected, and living things would have relied on fermentation instead.
7.23.68	At some point before, about 3.5 billion years ago, some prokaryotes began using energy from sunlight to power anabolic processes that reduce carbon dioxide to form organic compounds.
7.23.69	That is, they evolved the ability to photosynthesize.
7.23.70	Hydrogen, derived from various sources, was captured using light-powered reactions to reduce fixed carbon dioxide in the Calvin cycle.
7.23.71	The group of Gram-negative bacteria that gave rise to cyanobacteria used water as the hydrogen source and released O2 as a waste product.
7.23.72	Eventually, the amount of photosynthetic oxygen built up in some environments to levels that posed a risk to living organisms, since it can damage many organic compounds.
7.23.73	Various metabolic processes evolved that protected organisms from oxygen, one of which, aerobic respiration, also generated high levels of ATP.
7.23.74	It became widely present among prokaryotes, including in a group we now call alpha-proteobacteria.
7.23.75	Organisms that did not acquire aerobic respiration had to remain in oxygen-free environments.
7.23.76	Originally, oxygen-rich environments were likely localized around places where cyanobacteria were active, but by about 2 billion years ago, geological evidence shows that oxygen was building up to higher concentrations in the atmosphere.
7.23.77	Oxygen levels similar to today’s levels only arose within the last 700 million years.
7.23.78	Recall that the first fossils that we believe to be eukaryotes date to about 2 billion years old, so they appeared as oxygen levels were increasing.
7.23.79	Also, recall that all extant eukaryotes descended from an ancestor with mitochondria.
7.23.80	These organelles were first observed by light microscopists in the late 1800s, where they appeared to be somewhat worm-shaped structures that seemed to be moving around in the cell.
7.23.81	Some early observers suggested that they might be bacteria living inside host cells, but these hypotheses remained unknown or rejected in most scientific communities.
7.23.82	Endosymbiotic Theory
7.23.83	As cell biology developed in the twentieth century, it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for producing ATP using aerobic respiration.
7.23.84	In the 1960s, American biologist Lynn Margulis developed endosymbiotic theory, which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another, one living within another, and evolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such.
7.23.85	In 1967, Margulis introduced new work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence.
7.23.86	Although Margulis’ work initially was met with resistance, this once-revolutionary hypothesis is now widely (but not completely) accepted, with work progressing on uncovering the steps involved in this evolutionary process and the key players involved.
7.23.87	Much still remains to be discovered about the origins of the cells that now make up the cells in all living eukaryotes.
7.23.88	Broadly, it has become clear that many of our nuclear genes and the molecular machinery responsible for replication and expression appear closely related to those in Archaea.
7.23.89	On the other hand, the metabolic organelles and genes responsible for many energy-harvesting processes had their origins in bacteria.
7.23.90	Much remains to be clarified about how this relationship occurred; this continues to be an exciting field of discovery in biology.
7.23.91	For instance, it is not known whether the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria occurred before or after the host cell had a nucleus.
7.23.92	Such organisms would be among the extinct precursors of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes.
7.23.93	Mitochondria One of the major features distinguishing prokaryotes from eukaryotes is the presence of mitochondria.
7.23.94	Eukaryotic cells may contain anywhere from one to several thousand mitochondria, depending on the cell’s level of energy consumption.
7.23.95	Each mitochondrion measures 1 to 10 or greater micrometers in length and exists in the cell as an organelle that can be ovoid to worm-shaped to intricately branched (Figure 23.2).
7.23.96	Mitochondria arise from the division of existing mitochondria; they may fuse together; and they may be moved around inside the cell by interactions with the cytoskeleton.
7.23.97	However, mitochondria cannot survive outside the cell.
7.23.98	As the atmosphere was oxygenated by photosynthesis, and as successful aerobic prokaryotes evolved, evidence suggests that an ancestral cell with some membrane compartmentalization engulfed a free-living aerobic prokaryote, specifically an alpha-proteobacterium, thereby giving the host cell the ability to use oxygen to release energy stored in nutrients.
7.23.99	Alpha-proteobacteria are a large group of bacteria that includes species symbiotic with plants, disease organisms that can infect humans via ticks, and many free-living species that use light for energy.
7.23.100	Several lines of evidence support that mitochondria are derived from this endosymbiotic event.
7.23.101	Most mitochondria are shaped like alpha-proteobacteria and are surrounded by two membranes, which would result when one membrane-bound organism was engulfed into a vacuole by another membrane-bound organism.
7.23.102	The mitochondrial inner membrane is extensive and involves substantial infoldings called cristae that resemble the textured, outer surface of alpha-proteobacteria.
7.23.103	The matrix and inner membrane are rich with the enzymes necessary for aerobic respiration.
7.23.104	In this transmission electron micrograph of mitochondria in a mammalian lung cell, the cristae, infoldings of the mitochondrial inner membrane, can be seen in cross-section.
7.23.105	Mitochondria divide independently by a process that resembles binary fission in prokaryotes.
7.23.106	Specifically, mitochondria are not formed from scratch (de novo) by the eukaryotic cell; they reproduce within it and are distributed with the cytoplasm when a cell divides or two cells fuse.
7.23.107	Therefore, although these organelles are highly integrated into the eukaryotic cell, they still reproduce as if they are independent organisms within the cell.
7.23.108	However, their reproduction is synchronized with the activity and division of the cell.
7.23.109	Mitochondria have their own (usually) circular DNA chromosome that is stabilized by attachments to the inner membrane and carries genes similar to genes expressed by alpha-proteobacteria.
7.23.110	Mitochondria also have special ribosomes and transfer RNAs that resemble these components in prokaryotes.
7.23.111	These features all support that mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes.
7.23.112	Mitochondria that carry out aerobic respiration have their own genomes, with genes similar to those in alpha-proteobacteria.
7.23.113	However, many of the genes for respiratory proteins are located in the nucleus.
7.23.114	When these genes are compared to those of other organisms, they appear to be of alpha-proteobacterial origin.
7.23.115	Additionally, in some eukaryotic groups, such genes are found in the mitochondria, whereas in other groups, they are found in the nucleus.
7.23.116	This has been interpreted as evidence that genes have been transferred from the endosymbiont chromosome to the host genome.
7.23.117	This loss of genes by the endosymbiont is probably one explanation why mitochondria cannot live without a host.
7.23.118	Some living eukaryotes are anaerobic and cannot survive in the presence of too much oxygen.
7.23.119	Some appear to lack organelles that could be recognized as mitochondria.
7.23.120	In the 1970s to the early 1990s, many biologists suggested that some of these eukaryotes were descended from ancestors whose lineages had diverged from the lineage of mitochondrion-containing eukaryotes before endosymbiosis occurred.
7.23.121	However, later findings suggest that reduced organelles are found in most, if not all, anaerobic eukaryotes, and that all eukaryotes appear to carry some genes in their nuclei that are of mitochondrial origin.
7.23.122	In addition to the aerobic generation of ATP, mitochondria have several other metabolic functions.
7.23.123	One of these functions is to generate clusters of iron and sulfur that are important cofactors of many enzymes.
7.23.124	Such functions are often associated with the reduced mitochondrion-derived organelles of anaerobic eukaryotes.
7.23.125	Therefore, most biologists accept that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes had mitochondria.
7.23.126	Plastids
7.23.127	Some groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic.
7.23.128	Their cells contain, in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles, another kind of organelle called a plastid.
7.23.129	When such cells are carrying out photosynthesis, their plastids are rich in the pigment chlorophyll a and a range of other pigments, called accessory pigments, which are involved in harvesting energy from light.
7.23.130	Photosynthetic plastids are called chloroplasts.
7.23.131	This chloroplast cross-section illustrates its elaborate inner membrane organization.
7.23.132	Stacks of thylakoid membranes compartmentalize photosynthetic enzymes and provide scaffolding for chloroplast DNA.
7.23.133	(b)
7.23.134	In this micrograph of Elodea sp.
7.23.135	, the chloroplasts can be seen as small green spheres.
7.23.136	Like mitochondria, plastids appear to have an endosymbiotic origin.
7.23.137	This hypothesis was also championed by Lynn Margulis.
7.23.138	Plastids are derived from cyanobacteria that lived inside the cells of an ancestral, aerobic, heterotrophic eukaryote.
7.23.139	This is called primary endosymbiosis, and plastids of primary origin are surrounded by two membranes.
7.23.140	The best evidence is that this has happened twice in the history of eukaryotes.
7.23.141	In one case, the common ancestor of the major lineage/ supergroup Archaeplastida took on a cyanobacterial endosymbiont; in the other, the ancestor of the small amoeboid rhizarian taxon, Paulinella, took on a different cyanobacterial endosymbiont.
7.23.142	Almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes are descended from the first event, and only a couple of species are derived from the other.
7.23.143	Cyanobacteria are a group of Gram-negative bacteria with all the conventional structures of the group.
7.23.144	However, unlike most prokaryotes, they have extensive, internal membrane-bound sacs called thylakoids.
7.23.145	Chlorophyll is a component of these membranes, as are many of the proteins of the light reactions of photosynthesis.
7.23.146	Cyanobacteria also have the peptidoglycan wall and lipopolysaccharide layer associated with Gram-negative bacteria.
7.23.147	Chloroplasts of primary origin have thylakoids, a circular DNA chromosome, and ribosomes similar to those of cyanobacteria.
7.23.148	Each chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes.
7.23.149	In the group of Archaeplastida called the glaucophytes and in Paulinella, a thin peptidoglycan layer is present between the outer and inner plastid membranes.
7.23.150	All other plastids lack this relictual cyanobacterial wall.
7.23.151	The outer membrane surrounding the plastid is thought to be derived from the vacuole in the host, and the inner membrane is thought to be derived from the plasma membrane of the symbiont.
7.23.152	There is also, as with the case of mitochondria, strong evidence that many of the genes of the endosymbiont were transferred to the nucleus.
7.23.153	Plastids, like mitochondria, cannot live independently outside the host.
7.23.154	In addition, like mitochondria, plastids are derived from the division of other plastids and never built from scratch.
7.23.155	Researchers have suggested that the endosymbiotic event that led to Archaeplastida occurred 1 to 1.5 billion years ago, at least 5 hundred million years after the fossil record suggests that eukaryotes were present.
7.23.156	Not all plastids in eukaryotes are derived directly from primary endosymbiosis.
7.23.157	Some of the major groups of algae became photosynthetic by secondary endosymbiosis, that is, by taking in either green algae or red algae (both from Archaeplastida) as endosymbionts (Figure 23.4ab).
7.23.158	Numerous microscopic and genetic studies have supported this conclusion.
7.23.159	Secondary plastids are surrounded by three or more membranes, and some secondary plastids even have clear remnants of the nucleus of endosymbiotic alga.
7.23.160	Others have not “kept” any remnants.
7.23.161	There are cases where tertiary or higher-order endosymbiotic events are the best explanations for plastids in some eukaryotes.
7.23.162	Red algae and (b) green algae (visualized by light microscopy) share similar DNA sequences with photosynthetic cyanobacteria.
7.23.163	Scientists speculate that, in a process called endosymbiosis, an ancestral prokaryote engulfed a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that evolved into modern-day chloroplasts.
7.23.164	There are over 100,000 described living species of protists, and it is unclear how many undescribed species may exist.
7.23.165	Since many protists live as commensals or parasites in other organisms and these relationships are often species-specific, there is a huge potential for protist diversity that matches the diversity of hosts.
7.23.166	As the catchall term for eukaryotic organisms that are not animal, plant, or fungi, it is not surprising that very few characteristics are common to all protists.
7.23.167	Cell Structure
7.23.168	The cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells.
7.23.169	Most protists are microscopic and unicellular, but some true multicellular forms exist.
7.23.170	A few protists live as colonies that behave in some ways as a group of free-living cells and in other ways as a multicellular organism.
7.23.171	Still other protists are composed of enormous, multinucleate, single cells that look like amorphous blobs of slime, or in other cases, like ferns.
7.23.172	In fact, many protist cells are multinucleated; in some species, the nuclei are different sizes and have distinct roles in protist cell function.
7.23.173	Single protist cells range in size from less than a micrometer to three meters in length to hectares.
7.23.174	Protist cells may be enveloped by animal-like cell membranes or plant-like cell walls.
7.23.175	Others are encased in glassy silica-based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips.
7.23.176	The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor, preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion.
7.23.177	Metabolism Protists exhibit many forms of nutrition and may be aerobic or anaerobic.
7.23.178	Protists that store energy by photosynthesis belong to a group of photoautotrophs and are characterized by the presence of chloroplasts.
7.23.179	Other protists are heterotrophic and consume organic materials (such as other organisms) to obtain nutrition.
7.23.180	Amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest particles by a process called phagocytosis, in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward, pinching off an intracellular membranous sac, or vesicle, called a food vacuole (Figure 23.7).
7.23.181	The vesicle containing the ingested particle, the phagosome, then fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes to produce a phagolysosome, and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in cellular metabolism.
7.23.182	Undigested remains ultimately are expelled from the cell via exocytosis.
7.23.183	The stages of phagocytosis include the engulfment of a food particle, the digestion of the particle using hydrolytic enzymes contained within a lysosome, and the expulsion of undigested materials from the cell.
7.23.184	Subtypes of heterotrophs, called saprobes, absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes.
7.23.185	Some protists can function as mixotrophs, obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes, depending on whether sunlight or organic nutrients are available.
7.23.186	Motility
7.23.187	The majority of protists are motile, but different types of protists have evolved varied modes of movement (Figure 23.8).
7.23.188	Some protists have one or more flagella, which they rotate or whip.
7.23.189	Others are covered in rows or tufts of tiny cilia that they coordinately beat to swim.
7.23.190	Still others form cytoplasmic extensions called pseudopodia anywhere on the cell, anchor the pseudopodia to a substrate, and pull themselves forward.
7.23.191	Some protists can move toward or away from a stimulus, a movement referred to as taxis.
7.23.192	Movement toward light, termed phototaxis, is accomplished by coupling their locomotion strategy with a light-sensing organ.
7.23.193	Protists use various methods for transportation.
7.23.194	(a) Paramecium waves hair-like appendages called cilia to propel itself.
7.23.195	(b) Amoeba uses lobe-like pseudopodia to anchor itself to a solid surface and pull itself forward.
7.23.196	(c) Euglena uses a whip-like tail called a flagellum to propel itself.
7.23.197	Life Cycles Protists reproduce by a variety of mechanisms.
7.23.198	Most undergo some form of asexual reproduction, such as binary fission, to produce two daughter cells.
7.23.199	In protists, binary fission can be divided into transverse or longitudinal, depending on the axis of orientation; sometimes Paramecium exhibits this method.
7.23.200	Some protists such as the true slime molds exhibit multiple fission and simultaneously divide into many daughter cells.
7.23.201	Others produce tiny buds that go on to divide and grow to the size of the parental protist.
7.23.202	Sexual reproduction, involving meiosis and fertilization, is common among protists, and many protist species can switch from asexual to sexual reproduction when necessary.
7.23.203	Sexual reproduction is often associated with periods when nutrients are depleted or environmental changes occur.
7.23.204	Sexual reproduction may allow the protist to recombine genes and produce new variations of progeny that may be better suited to surviving in the new environment.
7.23.205	However, sexual reproduction is often associated with resistant cysts that are a protective, resting stage.
7.23.206	Depending on their habitat, the cysts may be particularly resistant to temperature extremes, desiccation, or low pH.
7.23.207	This strategy also allows certain protists to “
7.23.208	wait out” stressors until their environment becomes more favorable for survival or until they are carried (such as by wind, water, or transport on a larger organism) to a different environment, because cysts exhibit virtually no cellular metabolism.
7.23.209	Protist life cycles range from simple to extremely elaborate.
7.23.210	Certain parasitic protists have complicated life cycles and must infect different host species at different developmental stages to complete their life cycle.
7.23.211	Some protists are unicellular in the haploid form and multicellular in the diploid form, a strategy employed by animals.
7.23.212	Other protists have multicellular stages in both haploid and diploid forms, a strategy called alternation of generations that is also used by plants.
7.23.213	Habitats
7.23.214	Nearly all protists exist in some type of aquatic environment, including freshwater and marine environments, damp soil, and even snow.
7.23.215	Several protist species are parasites that infect animals or plants.
7.23.216	A few protist species live on dead organisms or their wastes, and contribute to their decay.
7.23.217	In the span of several decades, the Kingdom Protista has been disassembled because sequence analyses have revealed new genetic (and therefore evolutionary) relationships among these eukaryotes.
7.23.218	Moreover, protists that exhibit similar morphological features may have evolved analogous structures because of similar selective pressures—rather than because of recent common ancestry.
7.23.219	This phenomenon, called convergent evolution, is one reason why protist classification is so challenging.
7.23.220	The emerging classification scheme groups the entire domain Eukaryota into six “supergroups” that contain all of the protists as well as animals, plants, and fungi that evolved from a common ancestor (Figure 23.9).
7.23.221	The supergroups are believed to be monophyletic, meaning that all organisms within each supergroup are believed to have evolved from a single common ancestor, and thus all members are most closely related to each other than to organisms outside that group.
7.23.222	There is still evidence lacking for the monophyly of some groups.
7.23.223	This diagram shows a proposed classification of the domain Eukara.
7.23.224	Currently, the domain Eukarya is divided into six supergroups.
7.23.225	Within each supergroup are multiple kingdoms.
7.23.226	Dotted lines indicate suggested evolutionary relationships that remain under debate.
7.23.227	The classification of eukaryotes is still in flux, and the six supergroups may be modified or replaced by a more appropriate hierarchy as genetic, morphological, and ecological data accumulate.
7.23.228	Keep in mind that the classification scheme presented here is just one of several hypotheses, and the true evolutionary relationships are still to be determined.
7.23.229	When learning about protists, it is helpful to focus less on the nomenclature and more on the commonalities and differences that define the groups themselves.
7.23.230	Excavata
7.23.231	Many of the protist species classified into the supergroup Excavata are asymmetrical, single-celled organisms with a feeding groove “excavated” from one side.
7.23.232	This supergroup includes heterotrophic predators, photosynthetic species, and parasites.
7.23.233	Its subgroups are the diplomonads, parabasalids, and euglenozoans.
7.23.234	Diplomonads Among the Excavata are the diplomonads, which include the intestinal parasite, Giardia lamblia (Figure 23.10).
7.23.235	Until recently, these protists were believed to lack mitochondria.
7.23.236	Mitochondrial remnant organelles, called mitosomes, have since been identified in diplomonads, but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional.
7.23.237	Diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways, such as glycolysis, to generate energy.
7.23.238	Each diplomonad cell has two identical nuclei and uses several flagella for locomotion.
7.23.239	The mammalian intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, visualized here using scanning electron microscopy, is a waterborne protist that causes severe diarrhea when ingested.
7.23.240	(credit: modification of work by Janice Carr, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.23.241	Parabasalids
7.23.242	A second Excavata subgroup, the parabasalids, also exhibits semi-functional mitochondria.
7.23.243	In parabasalids, these structures function anaerobically and are called hydrogenosomes because they produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct.
7.23.244	Parabasalids move with flagella and membrane rippling.
7.23.245	Trichomonas vaginalis, a parabasalid that causes a sexually transmitted disease in humans, employs these mechanisms to transit through the male and female urogenital tracts.
7.23.246	T. vaginalis causes trichamoniasis, which appears in an estimated 180 million cases worldwide each year.
7.23.247	Whereas men rarely exhibit symptoms during an infection with this protist, infected women may become more susceptible to secondary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may be more likely to develop cervical cancer.
7.23.248	Pregnant women infected with T. vaginalis are at an increased risk of serious complications, such as pre-term delivery.
7.23.249	Euglenozoans Euglenozoans includes parasites, heterotrophs, autotrophs, and mixotrophs, ranging in size from 10 to 500 μm.
7.23.250	Euglenoids move through their aquatic habitats using two long flagella that guide them toward light sources sensed by a primitive ocular organ called an eyespot.
7.23.251	The familiar genus, Euglena, encompasses some mixotrophic species that display a photosynthetic capability only when light is present.
7.23.252	In the dark, the chloroplasts of Euglena shrink up and temporarily cease functioning, and the cells instead take up organic nutrients from their environment.
7.23.253	The human parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, belongs to a different subgroup of Euglenozoa, the kinetoplastids.
7.23.254	The kinetoplastid subgroup is named after the kinetoplast, a DNA mass carried within the single, oversized mitochondrion possessed by each of these cells.
7.23.255	This subgroup includes several parasites, collectively called trypanosomes, which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect species during a portion of their life cycle.
7.23.256	T. brucei develops in the gut of the tsetse fly after the fly bites an infected human or other mammalian host.
7.23.257	The parasite then travels to the insect salivary glands to be transmitted to another human or other mammal when the infected tsetse fly consumes another blood meal.
7.23.258	T. brucei is common in central Africa and is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, a disease associated with severe chronic fatigue, coma, and can be fatal if left untreated.
7.23.259	Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness, spends part of its life cycle in the tsetse fly and part in humans.
7.23.260	Chromalveolata Current evidence suggests that species classified as chromalveolates are derived from a common ancestor that engulfed a photosynthetic red algal cell, which itself had already evolved chloroplasts from an endosymbiotic relationship with a photosynthetic prokaryote.
7.23.261	Therefore, the ancestor of chromalveolates is believed to have resulted from a secondary endosymbiotic event.
7.23.262	However, some chromalveolates appear to have lost red alga-derived plastid organelles or lack plastid genes altogether.
7.23.263	Therefore, this supergroup should be considered a hypothesis-based working group that is subject to change.
7.23.264	Chromalveolates include very important photosynthetic organisms, such as diatoms, brown algae, and significant disease agents in animals and plants.
7.23.265	The chromalveolates can be subdivided into alveolates and stramenopiles.
7.23.266	Alveolates: Dinoflagellates, Apicomplexians, and Ciliates
7.23.267	A large body of data supports that the alveolates are derived from a shared common ancestor.
7.23.268	The alveolates are named for the presence of an alveolus, or membrane-enclosed sac, beneath the cell membrane.
7.23.269	The exact function of the alveolus is unknown, but it may be involved in osmoregulation.
7.23.270	The alveolates are further categorized into some of the better-known protists: the dinoflagellates, the apicomplexans, and the ciliates.
7.23.271	Dinoflagellates exhibit extensive morphological diversity and can be photosynthetic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic.
7.23.272	Many dinoflagellates are encased in interlocking plates of cellulose.
7.23.273	Two perpendicular flagella fit into the grooves between the cellulose plates, with one flagellum extending longitudinally and a second encircling the dinoflagellate (Figure 23.12).
7.23.274	Together, the flagella contribute to the characteristic spinning motion of dinoflagellates.
7.23.275	These protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats, and are a component of plankton, the typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for larger aquatic organisms.
7.23.276	The dinoflagellates exhibit great diversity in shape.
7.23.277	Many are encased in cellulose armor and have two flagella that fit in grooves between the plates.
7.23.278	Movement of these two perpendicular flagella causes a spinning motion.
7.23.279	Some dinoflagellates generate light, called bioluminescence, when they are jarred or stressed.
7.23.280	Large numbers of marine dinoflagellates (billions or trillions of cells per wave) can emit light and cause an entire breaking wave to twinkle or take on a brilliant blue color (Figure 23.13).
7.23.281	For approximately 20 species of marine dinoflagellates, population explosions (also called blooms) during the summer months can tint the ocean with a muddy red color.
7.23.282	This phenomenon is called a red tide, and it results from the abundant red pigments present in dinoflagellate plastids.
7.23.283	In large quantities, these dinoflagellate species secrete an asphyxiating toxin that can kill fish, birds, and marine mammals.
7.23.284	Red tides can be massively detrimental to commercial fisheries, and humans who consume these protists may become poisoned.
7.23.285	Bioluminescence is emitted from dinoflagellates in a breaking wave, as seen from the New Jersey coast.
7.23.286	The apicomplexan protists are so named because their microtubules, fibrin, and vacuoles are asymmetrically distributed at one end of the cell in a structure called an apical complex (Figure 23.14).
7.23.287	The apical complex is specialized for entry and infection of host cells.
7.23.288	Indeed, all apicomplexans are parasitic.
7.23.289	This group includes the genus Plasmodium, which causes malaria in humans.
7.23.290	Apicomplexan life cycles are complex, involving multiple hosts and stages of sexual and asexual reproduction.
7.23.291	Apicomplexans are parasitic protists.
7.23.292	They have a characteristic apical complex that enables them to infect host cells.
7.23.293	(b) Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has a complex life cycle typical of apicomplexans.
7.23.294	The ciliates, which include Paramecium and Tetrahymena, are a group of protists 10 to 3,000 micrometers in length that are covered in rows, tufts, or spirals of tiny cilia.
7.23.295	By beating their cilia synchronously or in waves, ciliates can coordinate directed movements and ingest food particles.
7.23.296	Certain ciliates have fused cilia-based structures that function like paddles, funnels, or fins.
7.23.297	Ciliates also are surrounded by a pellicle, providing protection without compromising agility.
7.23.298	The genus Paramecium includes protists that have organized their cilia into a plate-like primitive mouth, called an oral groove, which is used to capture and digest bacteria (Figure 23.15).
7.23.299	Food captured in the oral groove enters a food vacuole, where it combines with digestive enzymes.
7.23.300	Waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane, called the anal pore.
7.23.301	In addition to a vacuole-based digestive system, Paramecium also uses contractile vacuoles, which are osmoregulatory vesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell.
7.23.302	Paramecium has a primitive mouth (called an oral groove) to ingest food, and an anal pore to excrete it.
7.23.303	Contractile vacuoles allow the organism to excrete excess water.
7.23.304	Cilia enable the organism to move.
7.23.305	Paramecium has two nuclei, a macronucleus and a micronucleus, in each cell.
7.23.306	The micronucleus is essential for sexual reproduction, whereas the macronucleus directs asexual binary fission and all other biological functions.
7.23.307	The process of sexual reproduction in Paramecium underscores the importance of the micronucleus to these protists.
7.23.308	Paramecium and most other ciliates reproduce sexually by conjugation.
7.23.309	This process begins when two different mating types of Paramecium make physical contact and join with a cytoplasmic bridge (Figure 23.16).
7.23.310	The diploid micronucleus in each cell then undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid micronuclei.
7.23.311	Three of these degenerate in each cell, leaving one micronucleus that then undergoes mitosis, generating two haploid micronuclei.
7.23.312	The cells each exchange one of these haploid nuclei and move away from each other.
7.23.313	A similar process occurs in bacteria that have plasmids.
7.23.314	Fusion of the haploid micronuclei generates a completely novel diploid pre-micronucleus in each conjugative cell.
7.23.315	This pre-micronucleus undergoes three rounds of mitosis to produce eight copies, and the original macronucleus disintegrates.
7.23.316	Four of the eight pre-micronuclei become full-fledged micronuclei, whereas the other four perform multiple rounds of DNA replication and go on to become new macronuclei.
7.23.317	Two cell divisions then yield four new Paramecia from each original conjugative cell.
7.23.318	Stramenopiles:
7.23.319	Diatoms, Brown Algae, Golden Algae and Oomycetes
7.23.320	The other subgroup of chromalveolates, the stramenopiles, includes photosynthetic marine algae and heterotrophic protists.
7.23.321	The unifying feature of this group is the presence of a textured, or “hairy,” flagellum.
7.23.322	Many stramenopiles also have an additional flagellum that lacks hair-like projections (Figure 23.17).
7.23.323	Members of this subgroup range in size from singlecelled diatoms to the massive and multicellular kelp.
7.23.324	This stramenopile cell has a single hairy flagellum and a secondary smooth flagellum.
7.23.325	The diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic protists that encase themselves in intricately patterned, glassy cell walls composed of silicon dioxide in a matrix of organic particles (Figure 23.18).
7.23.326	These protists are a component of freshwater and marine plankton.
7.23.327	Most species of diatoms reproduce asexually, although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also exist.
7.23.328	Some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell, called a raphe.
7.23.329	By expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the raphe, the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction.
7.23.330	Assorted diatoms, visualized here using light microscopy, live among annual sea ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.
7.23.331	Diatoms range in size from 2 to 200 μm.
7.23.332	(credit: Prof. Gordon T. Taylor, Stony Brook University, NSF, NOAA)
7.23.333	During periods of nutrient availability, diatom populations bloom to numbers greater than can be consumed by aquatic organisms.
7.23.334	The excess diatoms die and sink to the sea floor where they are not easily reached by saprobes that feed on dead organisms.
7.23.335	As a result, the carbon dioxide that the diatoms had consumed and incorporated into their cells during photosynthesis is not returned to the atmosphere.
7.23.336	In general, this process by which carbon is transported deep into the ocean is described as the biological carbon pump, because carbon is “pumped” to the ocean depths where it is inaccessible to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
7.23.337	The biological carbon pump is a crucial component of the carbon cycle that maintains lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
7.23.338	Like diatoms, golden algae are largely unicellular, although some species can form large colonies.
7.23.339	Their characteristic gold color results from their extensive use of carotenoids, a group of photosynthetic pigments that are generally yellow or orange in color.
7.23.340	Golden algae are found in both freshwater and marine environments, where they form a major part of the plankton community.
7.23.341	The brown algae are primarily marine, multicellular organisms that are known colloquially as seaweeds.
7.23.342	Giant kelps are a type of brown algae.
7.23.343	Some brown algae have evolved specialized tissues that resemble terrestrial plants, with root-like holdfasts, stem-like stipes, and leaf-like blades that are capable of photosynthesis.
7.23.344	The stipes of giant kelps are enormous, extending in some cases for 60 meters.
7.23.345	A variety of algal life cycles exists, but the most complex is alternation of generations, in which both haploid and diploid stages involve multicellularity.
7.23.346	Compare this life cycle to that of humans, for instance.
7.23.347	Haploid gametes produced by meiosis (sperm and egg) combine in fertilization to generate a diploid zygote that undergoes many rounds of mitosis to produce a multicellular embryo and then a fetus.
7.23.348	However, the individual sperm and egg themselves never become multicellular beings.
7.23.349	Terrestrial plants also have evolved alternation of generations.
7.23.350	In the brown algae genus Laminaria, haploid spores develop into multicellular gametophytes, which produce haploid gametes that combine to produce diploid organisms that then become multicellular organisms with a different structure from the haploid form (Figure 23.19).
7.23.351	Certain other organisms perform alternation of generations in which both the haploid and diploid forms look the same.
7.23.352	The water molds, oomycetes (“egg fungus”), were so-named based on their fungus-like morphology, but molecular data have shown that the water molds are not closely related to fungi.
7.23.353	The oomycetes are characterized by a cellulose-based cell wall and an extensive network of filaments that allow for nutrient uptake.
7.23.354	As diploid spores, many oomycetes have two oppositely directed flagella (one hairy and one smooth) for locomotion.
7.23.355	The oomycetes are nonphotosynthetic and include many saprobes and parasites.
7.23.356	The saprobes appear as white fluffy growths on dead organisms (Figure 23.20).
7.23.357	Most oomycetes are aquatic, but some parasitize terrestrial plants.
7.23.358	One plant pathogen is Phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of late blight of potatoes, such as occurred in the nineteenth century Irish potato famine.
7.23.359	A saprobic oomycete engulfs a dead insect.

7.23.361	Rhizaria
7.23.362	The Rhizaria supergroup includes many of the amoebas, most of which have threadlike or needle-like pseudopodia (Figure 23.21).
7.23.363	Pseudopodia function to trap and engulf food particles and to direct movement in rhizarian protists.
7.23.364	These pseudopods project outward from anywhere on the cell surface and can anchor to a substrate.
7.23.365	The protist then transports its cytoplasm into the pseudopod, thereby moving the entire cell.
7.23.366	This type of motion, called cytoplasmic streaming, is used by several diverse groups of protists as a means of locomotion or as a method to distribute nutrients and oxygen.
7.23.367	Ammonia tepida, a Rhizaria species viewed here using phase contrast light microscopy, exhibits many threadlike pseudopodia.
7.23.368	Forams Foraminiferans, or forams, are unicellular heterotrophic protists, ranging from approximately 20 micrometers to several centimeters in length, and occasionally resembling tiny snails (Figure 23.22).
7.23.369	As a group, the forams exhibit porous shells, called tests that are built from various organic materials and typically hardened with calcium carbonate.
7.23.370	The tests may house photosynthetic algae, which the forams can harvest for nutrition.
7.23.371	Foram pseudopodia extend through the pores and allow the forams to move, feed, and gather additional building materials.
7.23.372	Typically, forams are associated with sand or other particles in marine or freshwater habitats.
7.23.373	Foraminiferans are also useful as indicators of pollution and changes in global weather patterns.
7.23.374	These shells from foraminifera sank to the sea floor.

7.23.377	Radiolarians A second subtype of Rhizaria, the radiolarians, exhibit intricate exteriors of glassy silica with radial or bilateral symmetry (Figure 23.23).
7.23.378	Needle-like pseudopods supported by microtubules radiate outward from the cell bodies of these protists and function to catch food particles.
7.23.379	The shells of dead radiolarians sink to the ocean floor, where they may accumulate in 100 meter-thick depths.
7.23.380	Preserved, sedimented radiolarians are very common in the fossil record.
7.23.381	This fossilized radiolarian shell was imaged using a scanning electron microscope.
7.23.382	(credit: modification of work by Hannes Grobe, Alfred Wegener Institute; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.23.383	Archaeplastida Red algae and green algae are included in the supergroup Archaeplastida.
7.23.384	It was from a common ancestor of these protists that the land plants evolved, since their closest relatives are found in this group.
7.23.385	Molecular evidence supports that all Archaeplastida are descendents of an endosymbiotic relationship between a heterotrophic protist and a cyanobacterium.
7.23.386	The red and green algae include unicellular, multicellular, and colonial forms.
7.23.387	Red Algae Red algae, or rhodophytes, are primarily multicellular, lack flagella, and range in size from microscopic, unicellular protists to large, multicellular forms grouped into the informal seaweed category.
7.23.388	The red algae life cycle is an alternation of generations.
7.23.389	Some species of red algae contain phycoerythrins, photosynthetic accessory pigments that are red in color and outcompete the green tint of chlorophyll, making these species appear as varying shades of red.
7.23.390	Other protists classified as red algae lack phycoerythrins and are parasites.
7.23.391	Red algae are common in tropical waters where they have been detected at depths of 260 meters.
7.23.392	Other red algae exist in terrestrial or freshwater environments.
7.23.393	Green Algae: Chlorophytes and Charophytes
7.23.394	The most abundant group of algae is the green algae.
7.23.395	The green algae exhibit similar features to the land plants, particularly in terms of chloroplast structure.
7.23.396	That this group of protists shared a relatively recent common ancestor with land plants is well supported.
7.23.397	The green algae are subdivided into the chlorophytes and the charophytes.
7.23.398	The charophytes are the closest living relatives to land plants and resemble them in morphology and reproductive strategies.
7.23.399	Charophytes are common in wet habitats, and their presence often signals a healthy ecosystem.
7.23.400	The chlorophytes exhibit great diversity of form and function.
7.23.401	Chlorophytes primarily inhabit freshwater and damp soil, and are a common component of plankton.
7.23.402	Chlamydomonas is a simple, unicellular chlorophyte with a pear-shaped morphology and two opposing, anterior flagella that guide this protist toward light sensed by its eyespot.
7.23.403	More complex chlorophyte species exhibit haploid gametes and spores that resemble Chlamydomonas.
7.23.404	The chlorophyte Volvox is one of only a few examples of a colonial organism, which behaves in some ways like a collection of individual cells, but in other ways like the specialized cells of a multicellular organism (Figure 23.24).
7.23.405	Volvox colonies contain 500 to 60,000 cells, each with two flagella, contained within a hollow, spherical matrix composed of a gelatinous glycoprotein secretion.
7.23.406	Individual Volvox cells move in a coordinated fashion and are interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges.
7.23.407	Only a few of the cells reproduce to create daughter colonies, an example of basic cell specialization in this organism.
7.23.408	Volvox aureus is a green alga in the supergroup Archaeplastida.
7.23.409	This species exists as a colony, consisting of cells immersed in a gel-like matrix and intertwined with each other via hair-like cytoplasmic extensions.
7.23.410	True multicellular organisms, such as the sea lettuce, Ulva, are represented among the chlorophytes.
7.23.411	In addition, some chlorophytes exist as large, multinucleate, single cells.
7.23.412	Species in the genus Caulerpa exhibit flattened fern-like foliage and can reach lengths of 3 meters (Figure 23.25).
7.23.413	Caulerpa species undergo nuclear division, but their cells do not complete cytokinesis, remaining instead as massive and elaborate single cells.
7.23.414	Caulerpa taxifolia is a chlorophyte consisting of a single cell containing potentially thousands of nuclei.
7.23.415	Amoebozoa The amoebozoans characteristically exhibit pseudopodia that extend like tubes or flat lobes, rather than the hair-like pseudopodia of rhizarian amoeba (Figure 23.26).
7.23.416	The Amoebozoa include several groups of unicellular amoeba-like organisms that are free-living or parasites.
7.23.417	Amoebae with tubular and lobe-shaped pseudopodia are seen under a microscope.
7.23.418	These isolates would be morphologically classified as amoebozoans.
7.23.419	Slime Molds
7.23.420	A subset of the amoebozoans, the slime molds, has several morphological similarities to fungi that are thought to be the result of convergent evolution.
7.23.421	For instance, during times of stress, some slime molds develop into spore-generating fruiting bodies, much like fungi.
7.23.422	The slime molds are categorized on the basis of their life cycles into plasmodial or cellular types.
7.23.423	Plasmodial slime molds are composed of large, multinucleate cells and move along surfaces like an amorphous blob of slime during their feeding stage (Figure 23.27).
7.23.424	Food particles are lifted and engulfed into the slime mold as it glides along.
7.23.425	Upon maturation, the plasmodium takes on a net-like appearance with the ability to form fruiting bodies, or sporangia, during times of stress.
7.23.426	Haploid spores are produced by meiosis within the sporangia, and spores can be disseminated through the air or water to potentially land in more favorable environments.
7.23.427	If this occurs, the spores germinate to form ameboid or flagellate haploid cells that can combine with each other and produce a diploid zygotic slime mold to complete the life cycle.
7.23.428	The life cycle of the plasmodial slime mold is shown.
7.23.429	The brightly colored plasmodium in the inset photo is a single-celled, multinucleate mass.
7.23.430	The cellular slime molds function as independent amoeboid cells when nutrients are abundant (Figure 23.28).
7.23.431	When food is depleted, cellular slime molds pile onto each other into a mass of cells that behaves as a single unit, called a slug.
7.23.432	Some cells in the slug contribute to a 2–3-millimeter stalk, drying up and dying in the process.
7.23.433	Cells atop the stalk form an asexual fruiting body that contains haploid spores.
7.23.434	As with plasmodial slime molds, the spores are disseminated and can germinate if they land in a moist environment.
7.23.435	One representative genus of the cellular slime molds is Dictyostelium, which commonly exists in the damp soil of forests.
7.23.436	Cellular slime molds may exist as solitary or aggregated amoebas.
7.23.437	Opisthokonta
7.23.438	The opisthokonts include the animal-like choanoflagellates, which are believed to resemble the common ancestor of sponges and, in fact, all animals.
7.23.439	Choanoflagellates include unicellular and colonial forms, and number about 244 described species.
7.23.440	These organisms exhibit a single, apical flagellum that is surrounded by a contractile collar composed of microvilli.
7.23.441	The collar uses a similar mechanism to sponges to filter out bacteria for ingestion by the protist.
7.23.442	The morphology of choanoflagellates was recognized early on as resembling the collar cells of sponges, and suggesting a possible relationship to animals.
7.23.443	The Mesomycetozoa form a small group of parasites, primarily of fish, and at least one form that can parasitize humans.
7.23.444	Their life cycles are poorly understood.
7.23.445	These organisms are of special interest, because they appear to be so closely related to animals.
7.23.446	In the past, they were grouped with fungi and other protists based on their morphology.
7.23.447	Protists function in various ecological niches.
7.23.448	Whereas some protist species are essential components of the food chain and generators of biomass, others function in the decomposition of organic materials.
7.23.449	Still other protists are dangerous human pathogens or causative agents of devastating plant diseases.
7.23.450	Primary Producers/Food Sources Protists are essential sources of nutrition for many other organisms.
7.23.451	In some cases, as in plankton, protists are consumed directly.
7.23.452	Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms.
7.23.453	For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae use sunlight to fix inorganic carbon.
7.23.454	In this symbiotic relationship, these protists provide nutrients for coral polyps (Figure 23.29) that house them, giving corals a boost of energy to secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton.
7.23.455	In turn, the corals provide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis.
7.23.456	This type of symbiotic relationship is important in nutrient-poor environments.
7.23.457	Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching, and they eventually die.
7.23.458	This explains why reefbuilding corals do not reside in waters deeper than 20 meters: insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.
7.23.459	Coral polyps obtain nutrition through a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellates.
7.23.460	The protists themselves and their products of photosynthesis are essential—directly or indirectly—to the survival of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals (Figure 23.30).
7.23.461	As primary producers, protists feed a large proportion of the world’s aquatic species.
7.23.462	(On land, terrestrial plants serve as primary producers.)
7.23.463	In fact, approximately one-quarter of the world’s photosynthesis is conducted by protists, particularly dinoflagellates, diatoms, and multicellular algae.
7.23.464	Virtually all aquatic organisms depend directly or indirectly on protists for food.
7.23.465	Protists do not create food sources only for sea-dwelling organisms.
7.23.466	For instance, certain anaerobic parabasalid species exist in the digestive tracts of termites and wood-eating cockroaches, where they contribute an essential step in the digestion of cellulose ingested by these insects as they bore through wood.
7.23.467	Human Pathogens
7.23.468	A pathogen is anything that causes disease.
7.23.469	Parasites live in or on an organism and harm the organism.
7.23.470	A significant number of protists are pathogenic parasites that must infect other organisms to survive and propagate.
7.23.471	Protist parasites include the causative agents of malaria, African sleeping sickness, and waterborne gastroenteritis in humans.
7.23.472	Other protist pathogens prey on plants, effecting massive destruction of food crops.
7.23.473	Plasmodium Species Members of the genus
7.23.474	Plasmodium must colonize both a mosquito and a vertebrate to complete their life cycle.
7.23.475	In vertebrates, the parasite develops in liver cells and goes on to infect red blood cells, bursting from and destroying the blood cells with each asexual replication cycle (Figure 23.31).
7.23.476	Of the four Plasmodium species known to infect humans, P. falciparum accounts for 50 percent of all malaria cases and is the primary cause of disease-related fatalities in tropical regions of the world.
7.23.477	In 2010, it was estimated that malaria caused between one-half and one million deaths, mostly in African children.
7.23.478	During the course of malaria, P. falciparum can infect and destroy more than one-half of a human’s circulating blood cells, leading to severe anemia.
7.23.479	In response to waste products released as the parasites burst from infected blood cells, the host immune system mounts a massive inflammatory response with episodes of delirium-inducing fever as parasites lyse red blood cells, spilling parasite waste into the bloodstream.
7.23.480	P. falciparum is transmitted to humans by the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae.
7.23.481	Techniques to kill, sterilize, or avoid exposure to this highly aggressive mosquito species are crucial to malaria control.
7.23.482	Red blood cells are shown to be infected with P. falciparum, the causative agent of malaria.
7.23.483	In this light microscopic image taken using a 100× oil immersion lens, the ring-shaped P. falciparum stains purple.
7.23.484	Trypanosomes Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that is responsible for African sleeping sickness, confounds the human immune system by changing its thick layer of surface glycoproteins with each infectious cycle (Figure 23.32).
7.23.485	The glycoproteins are identified by the immune system as foreign antigens, and a specific antibody defense is mounted against the parasite.
7.23.486	However, T. brucei has thousands of possible antigens, and with each subsequent generation, the protist switches to a glycoprotein coating with a different molecular structure.
7.23.487	In this way, T. brucei is capable of replicating continuously without the immune system ever succeeding in clearing the parasite.
7.23.488	Without treatment, T. brucei attacks red blood cells, causing the patient to lapse into a coma and eventually die.
7.23.489	During epidemic periods, mortality from the disease can be high.
7.23.490	Greater surveillance and control measures lead to a reduction in reported cases; some of the lowest numbers reported in 50 years (fewer than 10,000 cases in all of sub-Saharan Africa) have happened since 2009.
7.23.491	In Latin America, another species, T. cruzi, is responsible for Chagas disease.
7.23.492	T. cruzi infections are mainly caused by a blood-sucking bug.
7.23.493	The parasite inhabits heart and digestive system tissues in the chronic phase of infection, leading to malnutrition and heart failure due to abnormal heart rhythms.
7.23.494	An estimated 10 million people are infected with Chagas disease, and it caused 10,000 deaths in 2008.
7.23.495	Trypanosomes are shown among red blood cells.
7.23.496	Plant Parasites Protist parasites of terrestrial plants include agents that destroy food crops.
7.23.497	The oomycete Plasmopara viticola parasitizes grape plants, causing a disease called downy mildew (Figure 23.33).
7.23.498	Grape plants infected with P. viticola appear stunted and have discolored, withered leaves.
7.23.499	The spread of downy mildew nearly collapsed the French wine industry in the nineteenth century.
7.23.500	Both downy and powdery mildews on this grape leaf are caused by an infection of P. viticola.
7.23.501	Phytophthora infestans is an oomycete responsible for potato late blight, which causes potato stalks and stems to decay into black slime
7.23.502	(Figure 23.34).
7.23.503	Widespread potato blight caused by P. infestans precipitated the well-known Irish potato famine in the nineteenth century that claimed the lives of approximately 1 million people and led to the emigration of at least 1 million more from Ireland.
7.23.504	Late blight continues to plague potato crops in certain parts of the United States and Russia, wiping out as much as 70 percent of crops when no pesticides are applied.
7.23.505	These unappetizing remnants result from an infection with P. infestans, the causative agent of potato late blight.
7.23.506	Agents of Decomposition
7.23.507	The fungus-like protist saprobes are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or their wastes.
7.23.508	For instance, many types of oomycetes grow on dead animals or algae.
7.23.509	Saprobic protists have the essential function of returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water.
7.23.510	This process allows for new plant growth, which in turn generates sustenance for other organisms along the food chain.
7.23.511	Indeed, without saprobe species, such as protists, fungi, and bacteria, life would cease to exist as all organic carbon became “tied up” in dead organisms.
7.24.0	Many species of fungus produce the familiar mushroom (a) which is a reproductive structure.
7.24.1	This (b) coral fungus displays brightly colored fruiting bodies.
7.24.2	This electron micrograph shows (c) the spore-bearing structures of Aspergillus, a type of toxic fungi found mostly in soil and plants.
7.24.3	The word fungus comes from the Latin word for mushrooms.
7.24.4	Indeed, the familiar mushroom is a reproductive structure used by many types of fungi.
7.24.5	However, there are also many fungi species that don't produce mushrooms at all.
7.24.6	Being eukaryotes, a typical fungal cell contains a true nucleus and many membrane-bound organelles.
7.24.7	The kingdom Fungi includes an enormous variety of living organisms collectively referred to as Eucomycota, or true Fungi.
7.24.8	While scientists have identified about 100,000 species of fungi, this is only a fraction of the 1.5 million species of fungus likely present on Earth.
7.24.9	Edible mushrooms, yeasts, black mold, and the producer of the antibiotic penicillin, Penicillium notatum, are all members of the kingdom Fungi, which belongs to the domain Eukarya.
7.24.10	Fungi, once considered plant-like organisms, are more closely related to animals than plants.
7.24.11	Fungi are not capable of photosynthesis: they are heterotrophic because they use complex organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon.
7.24.12	Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually, whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with alternation of generations.
7.24.13	Most fungi produce a large number of spores, which are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular, haploid individuals.
7.24.14	Like bacteria, fungi play an essential role in ecosystems because they are decomposers and participate in the cycling of nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules.
7.24.15	Fungi often interact with other organisms, forming beneficial or mutualistic associations.
7.24.16	For example most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi.
7.24.17	The roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus forming mycorrhizae.
7.24.18	Through mycorrhizae, the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water, greatly aiding the survival of both species Alternatively, lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner (usually an alga).
7.24.19	Fungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals.
7.24.20	For example, Dutch elm disease, which is caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi, is a particularly devastating type of fungal infestation that destroys many native species of elm (Ulmus sp.) by infecting the tree’s vascular system.
7.24.21	The elm bark beetle acts as a vector, transmitting the disease from tree to tree.
7.24.22	Accidentally introduced in the 1900s, the fungus decimated elm trees across the continent.
7.24.23	Many European and Asiatic elms are less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than American elms.
7.24.24	In humans, fungal infections are generally considered challenging to treat.
7.24.25	Unlike bacteria, fungi do not respond to traditional antibiotic therapy, since they are eukaryotes.
7.24.26	Fungal infections may prove deadly for individuals with compromised immune systems.
7.24.27	Fungi have many commercial applications.
7.24.28	The food industry uses yeasts in baking, brewing, and cheese and wine making.
7.24.29	Many industrial compounds are byproducts of fungal fermentation.
7.24.30	Fungi are the source of many commercial enzymes and antibiotics.
7.24.31	Although humans have used yeasts and mushrooms since prehistoric times, until recently, the biology of fungi was poorly understood.
7.24.32	Up until the mid-20th century, many scientists classified fungi as plants.
7.24.33	Fungi, like plants, arose mostly sessile and seemingly rooted in place.
7.24.34	They possess a stem-like structure similar to plants, as well as having a root-like fungal mycelium in the soil.
7.24.35	In addition, their mode of nutrition was poorly understood.
7.24.36	Progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of mycology: the scientific study of fungi.
7.24.37	Based on fossil evidence, fungi appeared in the pre-Cambrian era, about 450 million years ago.
7.24.38	Molecular biology analysis of the fungal genome demonstrates that fungi are more closely related to animals than plants.
7.24.39	They are a polyphyletic group of organisms that share characteristics, rather than sharing a single common ancestor.
7.24.40	Cell Structure and Function Fungi are eukaryotes, and as such, have a complex cellular organization.
7.24.41	As eukaryotes, fungal cells contain a membranebound nucleus.
7.24.42	The DNA in the nucleus is wrapped around histone proteins, as is observed in other eukaryotic cells.
7.24.43	A few types of fungi have structures comparable to bacterial plasmids (loops of DNA); however, the horizontal transfer of genetic information from one mature bacterium to another rarely occurs in fungi.
7.24.44	Fungal cells also contain mitochondria and a complex system of internal membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.
7.24.45	Unlike plant cells, fungal cells do not have chloroplasts or chlorophyll.
7.24.46	Many fungi display bright colors arising from other cellular pigments, ranging from red to green to black.
7.24.47	The poisonous Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) is recognizable by its bright red cap with white patches (Figure 24.2).
7.24.48	Pigments in fungi are associated with the cell wall and play a protective role against ultraviolet radiation.
7.24.49	Some fungal pigments are toxic.
7.24.50	The poisonous Amanita muscaria is native to temperate and boreal regions of North America.
7.24.51	Like plant cells, fungal cells have a thick cell wall.
7.24.52	The rigid layers of fungal cell walls contain complex polysaccharides called chitin and glucans.
7.24.53	Chitin, also found in the exoskeleton of insects, gives structural strength to the cell walls of fungi.
7.24.54	The wall protects the cell from desiccation and predators.
7.24.55	Fungi have plasma membranes similar to other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized by ergosterol: a steroid molecule that replaces the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes.
7.24.56	Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile.
7.24.57	Flagella are produced only by the gametes in the primitive Phylum Chytridiomycota.
7.24.58	Growth
7.24.59	The vegetative body of a fungus is a unicellular or multicellular thallus.
7.24.60	Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions.
7.24.61	Unicellular fungi are generally referred to as yeasts.
7.24.62	Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) and Candida species (the agents of thrush, a common fungal infection) are examples of unicellular fungi.
7.24.63	Candida albicans is a yeast cell and the agent of candidiasis and thrush.
7.24.64	This organism has a similar morphology to coccus bacteria; however, yeast is a eukaryotic organism (note the nucleus).
7.24.65	Most fungi are multicellular organisms.
7.24.66	They display two distinct morphological stages: the vegetative and reproductive.
7.24.67	The vegetative stage consists of a tangle of slender thread-like structures called hyphae (singular, hypha), whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous.
7.24.68	The mass of hyphae is a mycelium (Figure 24.4).
7.24.69	It can grow on a surface, in soil or decaying material, in a liquid, or even on living tissue.
7.24.70	Although individual hyphae must be observed under a microscope, the mycelium of a fungus can be very large, with some species truly being “the fungus humongous.
7.24.71	”
7.24.72	The giant Armillaria solidipes (honey mushroom) is considered the largest organism on Earth, spreading across more than 2,000 acres of underground soil in eastern Oregon; it is estimated to be at least 2,400 years old.
7.24.73	The mycelium of the fungus Neotestudina rosati can be pathogenic to humans.
7.24.74	The fungus enters through a cut or scrape and develops a mycetoma, a chronic subcutaneous infection.
7.24.75	Most fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by endwalls called septa (singular, septum)
7.24.76	(Figure 24.5a, c).
7.24.77	In most phyla of fungi, tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hypha.
7.24.78	They are described as perforated septa.
7.24.79	The hyphae in bread molds (which belong to the Phylum Zygomycota) are not separated by septa.
7.24.80	Instead, they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei, an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae.
7.24.81	Fungal hyphae may be (a) septated or (b) coenocytic (coeno- = "common"; -cytic = "cell") with many nuclei present in a single hypha.
7.24.82	A bright field light micrograph of (c)
7.24.83	Phialophora richardsiae shows septa that divide the hyphae.
7.24.84	Fungi thrive in environments that are moist and slightly acidic, and can grow with or without light.
7.24.85	They vary in their oxygen requirement.
7.24.86	Most fungi are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive.
7.24.87	Other species, such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, are are obligate anaerobes, in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them.
7.24.88	Yeasts are intermediate, being faculative anaerobes.
7.24.89	This means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration, but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not available.
7.24.90	The alcohol produced from yeast fermentation is used in wine and beer production.
7.24.91	Nutrition Like animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they use complex organic compounds as a source of carbon, rather than fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as do some bacteria and most plants.
7.24.92	In addition, fungi do not fix nitrogen from the atmosphere.
7.24.93	Like animals, they must obtain it from their diet.
7.24.94	However, unlike most animals, which ingest food and then digest it internally in specialized organs, fungi perform these steps in the reverse order; digestion precedes ingestion.
7.24.95	First, exoenzymes are transported out of the hyphae, where they process nutrients in the environment.
7.24.96	Then, the smaller molecules produced by this external digestion are absorbed through the large surface area of the mycelium.
7.24.97	As with animal cells, the polysaccharide of storage is glycogen, rather than starch, as found in plants.
7.24.98	Fungi are mostly saprobes (saprophyte is an equivalent term): organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter.
7.24.99	They obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic matter: mainly plant material.
7.24.100	Fungal exoenzymes are able to break down insoluble polysaccharides, such as the cellulose and lignin of dead wood, into readily absorbable glucose molecules.
7.24.101	The carbon, nitrogen, and other elements are thus released into the environment.
7.24.102	Because of their varied metabolic pathways, fungi fulfill an important ecological role and are being investigated as potential tools in bioremediation.
7.24.103	For example, some species of fungi can be used to break down diesel oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
7.24.104	Other species take up heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead.
7.24.105	Some fungi are parasitic, infecting either plants or animals.
7.24.106	Smut and Dutch elm disease affect plants, whereas athlete’s foot and candidiasis (thrush) are medically important fungal infections in humans.
7.24.107	In environments poor in nitrogen, some fungi resort to predation of nematodes (small non-segmented roundworms).
7.24.108	Species of Arthrobotrys fungi have a number of mechanisms to trap nematodes.
7.24.109	One mechanism involves constricting rings within the network of hyphae.
7.24.110	The rings swell when they touch the nematode, gripping it in a tight hold.
7.24.111	The fungus penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized hyphae called haustoria.
7.24.112	Many parasitic fungi possess haustoria, as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host, release digestive enzymes within the host's body, and absorb the digested nutrients.
7.24.113	Reproduction Fungi reproduce sexually and/or asexually.
7.24.114	Perfect fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually, while the so-called imperfect fungi reproduce only asexually (by mitosis).
7.24.115	In both sexual and asexual reproduction, fungi produce spores that disperse from the parent organism by either floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an animal.
7.24.116	Fungal spores are smaller and lighter than plant seeds.
7.24.117	The giant puffball mushroom bursts open and releases trillions of spores.
7.24.118	The huge number of spores released increases the likelihood of landing in an environment that will support growth.
7.24.119	The (a) giant puff ball mushroom releases (b) a cloud of spores when it reaches maturity.
7.24.120	The dark cells in this bright field light micrograph are the pathogenic yeast Histoplasma capsulatum, seen against a backdrop of light blue tissue.
7.24.121	Histoplasma primarily infects lungs but can spread to other tissues, causing histoplasmosis, a potentially fatal disease.
7.24.122	The most common mode of asexual reproduction is through the formation of asexual spores, which are produced by one parent only (through mitosis) and are genetically identical to that parent (Figure 24.8).
7.24.123	Spores allow fungi to expand their distribution and colonize new environments.
7.24.124	They may be released from the parent thallus either outside or within a special reproductive sac called a sporangium.
7.24.125	Fungi may have both asexual and sexual stages of reproduction.
7.24.126	There are many types of asexual spores.
7.24.127	Conidiospores are unicellular or multicellular spores that are released directly from the tip or side of the hypha.
7.24.128	Other asexual spores originate in the fragmentation of a hypha to form single cells that are released as spores; some of these have a thick wall surrounding the fragment.
7.24.129	Yet others bud off the vegetative parent cell.
7.24.130	Sporangiospores are produced in a sporangium.
7.24.131	This bright field light micrograph shows the release of spores from a sporangium at the end of a hypha called a sporangiophore.
7.24.132	The organism is a Mucor sp.
7.24.133	fungus, a mold often found indoors.
7.24.134	Sexual Reproduction Sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation into a population of fungi.
7.24.135	In fungi, sexual reproduction often occurs in response to adverse environmental conditions.
7.24.136	During sexual reproduction, two mating types are produced.
7.24.137	When both mating types are present in the same mycelium, it is called homothallic, or self-fertile.
7.24.138	Heterothallic mycelia require two different, but compatible, mycelia to reproduce sexually.
7.24.139	Although there are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction, all include the following three stages (Figure 24.8).
7.24.140	First, during plasmogamy (literally, “marriage or union of cytoplasm”), two haploid cells fuse, leading to a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell.
7.24.141	During karyogamy (“nuclear marriage”), the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus.
7.24.142	Finally, meiosis takes place in the gametangia (singular, gametangium) organs, in which gametes of different mating types are generated.
7.24.143	At this stage, spores are disseminated into the environment.
7.24.144	The kingdom Fungi contains five major phyla that were established according to their mode of sexual reproduction or using molecular data.
7.24.145	Polyphyletic, unrelated fungi that reproduce without a sexual cycle, are placed for convenience in a sixth group called a “form phylum”.
7.24.146	Not all mycologists agree with this scheme.
7.24.147	Rapid advances in molecular biology and the sequencing of 18S rRNA (a part of RNA) continue to show new and different relationships between the various categories of fungi.
7.24.148	The five true phyla of fungi are the Chytridiomycota (Chytrids), the Zygomycota (conjugated fungi), the Ascomycota (sac fungi), the Basidiomycota (club fungi) and the recently described Phylum Glomeromycota.
7.24.149	An older classification scheme grouped fungi that strictly use asexual reproduction into Deuteromycota, a group that is no longer in use.
7.24.150	Note:
7.24.151	“-mycota
7.24.152	” is used to designate a phylum while “
7.24.153	-mycetes
7.24.154	” formally denotes a class or is used informally to refer to all members of the phylum.
7.24.155	Chytridiomycota:
7.24.156	The Chytrids
7.24.157	The only class in the Phylum Chytridiomycota is the Chytridiomycetes.
7.24.158	The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive Eumycota, or true fungi.
7.24.159	The evolutionary record shows that the first recognizable chytrids appeared during the late pre- Cambrian period, more than 500 million years ago.
7.24.160	Like all fungi, chytrids have chitin in their cell walls, but one group of chytrids has both cellulose and chitin in the cell wall.
7.24.161	Most chytrids are unicellular; a few form multicellular organisms and hyphae, which have no septa between cells (coenocytic).
7.24.162	They produce gametes and diploid zoospores that swim with the help of a single flagellum.
7.24.163	The ecological habitat and cell structure of chytrids have much in common with protists.
7.24.164	Chytrids usually live in aquatic environments, although some species live on land.
7.24.165	Some species thrive as parasites on plants, insects, or amphibians (Figure 24.10), while others are saprobes.
7.24.166	The chytrid species Allomyces is well characterized as an experimental organism.
7.24.167	Its reproductive cycle includes both asexual and sexual phases.
7.24.168	Allomyces produces diploid or haploid flagellated zoospores in a sporangium.
7.24.169	The chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is seen in these light micrographs as transparent spheres growing on (a) a freshwater arthropod and (b) algae.
7.24.170	This chytrid causes skin diseases in many species of amphibians, resulting in species decline and extinction.
7.24.171	Zygomycota:
7.24.172	The Conjugated Fungi
7.24.173	The zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the Phylum Zygomycota.
7.24.174	They include the familiar bread mold, Rhizopus stolonifer, which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads, fruits, and vegetables.
7.24.175	Most species are saprobes, living off decaying organic material; a few are parasites, particularly of insects.
7.24.176	Zygomycetes play a considerable commercial role.
7.24.177	The metabolic products of other species of Rhizopus are intermediates in the synthesis of semi-synthetic steroid hormones.
7.24.178	Zygomycetes have a thallus of coenocytic hyphae in which the nuclei are haploid when the organism is in the vegetative stage.
7.24.179	The fungi usually reproduce asexually by producing sporangiospores (Figure 24.11).
7.24.180	The black tips of bread mold are the swollen sporangia packed with black spores (Figure 24.12).
7.24.181	When spores land on a suitable substrate, they germinate and produce a new mycelium.
7.24.182	Sexual reproduction starts when conditions become unfavorable.
7.24.183	Two opposing mating strains (type + and type –) must be in close proximity for gametangia from the hyphae to be produced and fuse, leading to karyogamy.
7.24.184	The developing diploid zygospores have thick coats that protect them from desiccation and other hazards.
7.24.185	They may remain dormant until environmental conditions are favorable.
7.24.186	When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis and produces haploid spores, which will, in turn, grow into a new organism.
7.24.187	This form of sexual reproduction in fungi is called conjugation (although it differs markedly from conjugation in bacteria and protists), giving rise to the name “conjugated fungi”.
7.24.188	Zygomycetes have asexual and asexual life cycles.
7.24.189	In the sexual life cycle, plus and minus mating types conjugate to form a zygosporangium.
7.24.190	Sporangia grow at the end of stalks, which appear as (a) white fuzz seen on this bread mold, Rhizopus stolonifer.
7.24.191	The (b) tips of bread mold are the spore-containing sporangia.
7.24.192	Ascomycota: The Sac Fungi
7.24.193	The majority of known fungi belong to the Phylum Ascomycota, which is characterized by the formation of an ascus (plural, asci), a sac-like structure that contains haploid ascospores.
7.24.194	Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance.
7.24.195	Some play a beneficial role, such as the yeasts used in baking, brewing, and wine fermentation, plus truffles and morels, which are held as gourmet delicacies.
7.24.196	Aspergillus oryzae is used in the fermentation of rice to produce sake.
7.24.197	Other ascomycetes parasitize plants and animals, including humans.
7.24.198	For example, fungal pneumonia poses a significant threat to AIDS patients who have a compromised immune system.
7.24.199	Ascomycetes not only infest and destroy crops directly; they also produce poisonous secondary metabolites that make crops unfit for consumption.
7.24.200	Filamentous ascomycetes produce hyphae divided by perforated septa, allowing streaming of cytoplasm from one cell to the other.
7.24.201	Conidia and asci, which are used respectively for asexual and sexual reproductions, are usually separated from the vegetative hyphae by blocked (non-perforated) septa.
7.24.202	Asexual reproduction is frequent and involves the production of conidiophores that release haploid conidiospores (Figure 24.13).
7.24.203	Sexual reproduction starts with the development of special hyphae from either one of two types of mating strains (Figure 24.13).
7.24.204	The “male” strain produces an antheridium and the “female” strain develops an ascogonium.
7.24.205	At fertilization, the antheridium and the ascogonium combine in plasmogamy without nuclear fusion.
7.24.206	Special ascogenous hyphae arise, in which pairs of nuclei migrate: one from the “male” strain and one from the “female” strain.
7.24.207	In each ascus, two or more haploid ascospores fuse their nuclei in karyogamy.
7.24.208	During sexual reproduction, thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the ascocarp.
7.24.209	The diploid nucleus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis.
7.24.210	The ascospores are then released, germinate, and form hyphae that are disseminated in the environment and start new mycelia.
7.24.211	The bright field light micrograph shows ascospores being released from asci in the fungus Talaromyces flavus var.
7.24.212	flavus.
7.24.213	Basidiomycota:
7.24.214	The Club Fungi
7.24.215	The fungi in the Phylum Basidiomycota are easily recognizable under a light microscope by their club-shaped fruiting bodies called basidia (singular, basidium), which are the swollen terminal cell of a hypha.
7.24.216	The basidia, which are the reproductive organs of these fungi, are often contained within the familiar mushroom, commonly seen in fields after rain, on the supermarket shelves, and growing on your lawn (Figure 24.15).
7.24.217	These mushroom-producing basidiomyces are sometimes referred to as “gill fungi” because of the presence of gill-like structures on the underside of the cap.
7.24.218	The “gills” are actually compacted hyphae on which the basidia are borne.
7.24.219	This group also includes shelf fungus, which cling to the bark of trees like small shelves.
7.24.220	In addition, the basidiomycota includes smuts and rusts, which are important plant pathogens; toadstools, and shelf fungi stacked on tree trunks.
7.24.221	Most edible fungi belong to the Phylum Basidiomycota; however, some basidiomycetes produce deadly toxins.
7.24.222	For example, Cryptococcus neoformans causes severe respiratory illness.
7.24.223	The fruiting bodies of a basidiomycete form a ring in a meadow, commonly called “fairy ring.
7.24.224	”
7.24.225	The best-known fairy ring fungus has the scientific name Marasmius oreades.
7.24.226	The body of this fungus, its mycelium, is underground and grows outward in a circle.
7.24.227	As it grows, the mycelium depletes the soil of nitrogen, causing the mycelia to grow away from the center and leading to the “fairy ring” of fruiting bodies where there is adequate soil nitrogen.
7.24.228	The lifecycle of basidiomycetes includes alternation of generations (Figure 24.16).
7.24.229	Spores are generally produced through sexual reproduction, rather than asexual reproduction.
7.24.230	The club-shaped basidium carries spores called basidiospores.
7.24.231	In the basidium, nuclei of two different mating strains fuse (karyogamy), giving rise to a diploid zygote that then undergoes meiosis.
7.24.232	The haploid nuclei migrate into basidiospores, which germinate and generate monokaryotic hyphae.
7.24.233	The mycelium that results is called a primary mycelium.
7.24.234	Mycelia of different mating strains can combine and produce a secondary mycelium that contains haploid nuclei of two different mating strains.
7.24.235	This is the dikaryotic stage of the basidiomyces lifecyle and and it is the dominant stage.
7.24.236	Eventually, the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp, which is a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground—this is what we think of as a mushroom.
7.24.237	The basidiocarp bears the developing basidia on the gills under its cap.
7.24.238	Asexual Ascomycota and Basidiomycota Imperfect fungi—those that do not display a sexual phase—use to be classified in the form phylum Deuteromycota, , a classification group no longer used in the present, ever-developing classification of organisms.
7.24.239	While Deuteromycota use to be a classification group, recent moleclular analysis has shown that the members classified in this group belong to the Ascomycota or the Basidiomycota classifications.
7.24.240	Since they do not possess the sexual structures that are used to classify other fungi, they are less well described in comparison to other members.
7.24.241	Most members live on land, with a few aquatic exceptions.
7.24.242	They form visible mycelia with a fuzzy appearance and are commonly known as mold.
7.24.243	Reproduction of the fungi in this group is strictly asexual and occurs mostly by production of asexual conidiospores (Figure 24.17).
7.24.244	Some hyphae may recombine and form heterokaryotic hyphae.
7.24.245	Genetic recombination is known to take place between the different nuclei.
7.24.246	Aspergillus niger is an asexually reproducing fungus (phylum Ascomycota) commonly found as a food contaminant.
7.24.247	The spherical structure in this light micrograph is a conidiophore.
7.24.248	The fungi in this group have a large impact on everyday human life.
7.24.249	The food industry relies on them for ripening some cheeses.
7.24.250	The blue veins in Roquefort cheese and the white crust on Camembert are the result of fungal growth.
7.24.251	The antibiotic penicillin was originally discovered on an overgrown Petri plate, on which a colony of Penicillium fungi killed the bacterial growth surrounding it.
7.24.252	Other fungi in this group cause serious diseases, either directly as parasites (which infect both plants and humans), or as producers of potent toxic compounds, as seen in the aflatoxins released by fungi of the genus Aspergillus.
7.24.253	Glomeromycota
7.24.254	The Glomeromycota is a newly established phylum which comprises about 230 species that all live in close association with the roots of trees.
7.24.255	Fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history.
7.24.256	It appears that all members of this family form arbuscular mycorrhizae:
7.24.257	the hyphae interact with the root cells forming a mutually beneficial association where the plants supply the carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the fungus, and the fungus supplies essential minerals from the soil to the plant.
7.24.258	The glomeromycetes do not reproduce sexually and do not survive without the presence of plant roots.
7.24.259	Although they have coenocytic hyphae like the zygomycetes, they do not form zygospores.
7.24.260	DNA analysis shows that all glomeromycetes probably descended from a common ancestor, making them a monophyletic lineage.
7.24.261	Fungi play a crucial role in the balance of ecosystems.
7.24.262	They colonize most habitats on Earth, preferring dark, moist conditions.
7.24.263	They can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms like algae to produce lichens.
7.24.264	Fungi are not obvious in the way large animals or tall trees appear.
7.24.265	Yet, like bacteria, they are the major decomposers of nature.
7.24.266	With their versatile metabolism, fungi break down organic matter, which would not otherwise be recycled.
7.24.267	Habitats
7.24.268	Although fungi are primarily associated with humid and cool environments that provide a supply of organic matter, they colonize a surprising diversity of habitats, from seawater to human skin and mucous membranes.
7.24.269	Chytrids are found primarily in aquatic environments.
7.24.270	Other fungi, such as Coccidioides immitis, which causes pneumonia when its spores are inhaled, thrive in the dry and sandy soil of the southwestern United States.
7.24.271	Fungi that parasitize coral reefs live in the ocean.
7.24.272	However, most members of the Kingdom Fungi grow on the forest floor, where the dark and damp environment is rich in decaying debris from plants and animals.
7.24.273	In these environments, fungi play a major role as decomposers and recyclers, making it possible for members of the other kingdoms to be supplied with nutrients and live.
7.24.274	Decomposers and Recyclers
7.24.275	The food web would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter (Figure 24.18).
7.24.276	Some elements—such as nitrogen and phosphorus—are required in large quantities by biological systems, and yet are not abundant in the environment.
7.24.277	The action of fungi releases these elements from decaying matter, making them available to other living organisms.
7.24.278	Trace elements present in low amounts in many habitats are essential for growth, and would remain tied up in rotting organic matter if fungi and bacteria did not return them to the environment via their metabolic activity.
7.24.279	Fungi are an important part of ecosystem nutrient cycles.
7.24.280	These bracket fungi growing on the side of a tree are the fruiting structures of a basidiomycete.
7.24.281	They receive their nutrients through their hyphae, which invade and decay the tree trunk.
7.24.282	The ability of fungi to degrade many large and insoluble molecules is due to their mode of nutrition.
7.24.283	As seen earlier, digestion precedes ingestion.
7.24.284	Fungi produce a variety of exoenzymes to digest nutrients.
7.24.285	The enzymes are either released into the substrate or remain bound to the outside of the fungal cell wall.
7.24.286	Large molecules are broken down into small molecules, which are transported into the cell by a system of protein carriers embedded in the cell membrane.
7.24.287	Because the movement of small molecules and enzymes is dependent on the presence of water, active growth depends on a relatively high percentage of moisture in the environment.
7.24.288	As saprobes, fungi help maintain a sustainable ecosystem for the animals and plants that share the same habitat.
7.24.289	In addition to replenishing the environment with nutrients, fungi interact directly with other organisms in beneficial, and sometimes damaging, ways.
7.24.290	Shelf fungi, so called because they grow on trees in a stack, attack and digest the trunk or branches of a tree.
7.24.291	While some shelf fungi are found only on dead trees, others can parasitize living trees and cause eventual death, so they are considered serious tree pathogens.
7.24.292	Mutualistic Relationships Symbiosis is the ecological interaction between two organisms that live together.
7.24.293	The definition does not describe the quality of the interaction.
7.24.294	When both members of the association benefit, the symbiotic relationship is called mutualistic.
7.24.295	Fungi form mutualistic associations with many types of organisms, including cyanobacteria, algae, plants, and animals.
7.24.296	Fungus/Plant Mutualism One of the most remarkable associations between fungi and plants is the establishment of mycorrhizae.
7.24.297	Mycorrhiza, which comes from the Greek words myco meaning fungus and rhizo meaning root, refers to the association between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi.
7.24.298	Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of all plant species have mycorrhizal partners.
7.24.299	In a mycorrhizal association, the fungal mycelia use their extensive network of hyphae and large surface area in contact with the soil to channel water and minerals from the soil into the plant.
7.24.300	In exchange, the plant supplies the products of photosynthesis to fuel the metabolism of the fungus.
7.24.301	There are a number of types of mycorrhizae.
7.24.302	Ectomycorrhizae (“outside” mycorrhiza) depend on fungi enveloping the roots in a sheath (called a mantle) and a Hartig net of hyphae that extends into the roots between cells (Figure 24.20).
7.24.303	The fungal partner can belong to the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota or Zygomycota.
7.24.304	In a second type, the Glomeromycete fungi form vesicular–arbuscular interactions with arbuscular mycorrhiza (sometimes called endomycorrhizae).
7.24.305	In these mycorrhiza, the fungi form arbuscules that penetrate root cells and are the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant (Figure 24.20 and Figure 24.21).
7.24.306	The arbuscules (from the Latin for little trees) have a shrub-like appearance.
7.24.307	Orchids rely on a third type of mycorrhiza.
7.24.308	Orchids are epiphytes that form small seeds without much storage to sustain germination and growth.
7.24.309	Their seeds will not germinate without a mycorrhizal partner (usually a Basidiomycete).
7.24.310	After nutrients in the seed are depleted, fungal symbionts support the growth of the orchid by providing necessary carbohydrates and minerals.
7.24.311	Some orchids continue to be mycorrhizal throughout their lifecycle.
7.24.312	The (a) infection of Pinus radiata (Monterey pine) roots by the hyphae of Amanita muscaria (fly amanita) causes the pine tree to produce many small, branched rootlets.
7.24.313	The Amanita hyphae cover these small roots with a white mantle.
7.24.314	(b) Spores (round bodies) and hyphae (thread-like structures) are evident in this light micrograph of an arbuscular mycorrhiza between a fungus and the root of a corn plant.
7.24.315	Lichens Lichens display a range of colors and textures (Figure 24.22) and can survive in the most unusual and hostile habitats.
7.24.316	They cover rocks, gravestones, tree bark, and the ground in the tundra where plant roots cannot penetrate.
7.24.317	Lichens can survive extended periods of drought, when they become completely desiccated, and then rapidly become active once water is available again.
7.24.318	Lichens have many forms.
7.24.319	They may be (a) crust-like, (b) hair-like, or (c) leaf-like.
7.24.320	Lichens are not a single organism, but rather an example of a mutualism, in which a fungus (usually a member of the Ascomycota or Basidiomycota phyla) lives in close contact with a photosynthetic organism (a eukaryotic alga or a prokaryotic cyanobacterium)
7.24.321	(Figure 24.23).
7.24.322	Generally, neither the fungus nor the photosynthetic organism can survive alone outside of the symbiotic relationship.
7.24.323	The body of a lichen, referred to as a thallus, is formed of hyphae wrapped around the photosynthetic partner.
7.24.324	The photosynthetic organism provides carbon and energy in the form of carbohydrates.
7.24.325	Some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, contributing nitrogenous compounds to the association.
7.24.326	In return, the fungus supplies minerals and protection from dryness and excessive light by encasing the algae in its mycelium.
7.24.327	The fungus also attaches the symbiotic organism to the substrate.
7.24.328	This cross-section of a lichen thallus shows the (a) upper cortex of fungal hyphae, which provides protection; the (b) algal zone where photosynthesis occurs, the (c) medulla of fungal hyphae, and the (d) lower cortex, which also provides protection and may have (e) rhizines to anchor the thallus to the substrate.
7.24.329	The thallus of lichens grows very slowly, expanding its diameter a few millimeters per year.
7.24.330	Both the fungus and the alga participate in the formation of dispersal units for reproduction.
7.24.331	Lichens produce soredia, clusters of algal cells surrounded by mycelia.
7.24.332	Soredia are dispersed by wind and water and form new lichens.
7.24.333	Lichens are extremely sensitive to air pollution, especially to abnormal levels of nitrogen and sulfur.
7.24.334	The U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service can monitor air quality by measuring the relative abundance and health of the lichen population in an area.
7.24.335	Lichens fulfill many ecological roles.
7.24.336	Caribou and reindeer eat lichens, and they provide cover for small invertebrates that hide in the mycelium.
7.24.337	In the production of textiles, weavers used lichens to dye wool for many centuries until the advent of synthetic dyes.
7.24.338	Fungus/Animal Mutualism Fungi have evolved mutualisms with numerous insects in Phylum Arthropoda: jointed, legged invertebrates.
7.24.339	Arthropods depend on the fungus for protection from predators and pathogens, while the fungus obtains nutrients and a way to disseminate spores into new environments.
7.24.340	The association between species of Basidiomycota and scale insects is one example.
7.24.341	The fungal mycelium covers and protects the insect colonies.
7.24.342	The scale insects foster a flow of nutrients from the parasitized plant to the fungus.
7.24.343	In a second example, leaf-cutting ants of Central and South America literally farm fungi.
7.24.344	They cut disks of leaves from plants and pile them up in gardens (Figure 24.24).
7.24.345	Fungi are cultivated in these disk gardens, digesting the cellulose in the leaves that the ants cannot break down.
7.24.346	Once smaller sugar molecules are produced and consumed by the fungi, the fungi in turn become a meal for the ants.
7.24.347	The insects also patrol their garden, preying on competing fungi.
7.24.348	Both ants and fungi benefit from the association.
7.24.349	The fungus receives a steady supply of leaves and freedom from competition, while the ants feed on the fungi they cultivate.
7.24.350	A leaf cutting ant transports a leaf that will feed a farmed fungus.
7.24.351	Fungivores Animal dispersal is important for some fungi because an animal may carry spores considerable distances from the source.
7.24.352	Fungal spores are rarely completely degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of an animal, and many are able to germinate when they are passed in the feces.
7.24.353	Some dung fungi actually require passage through the digestive system of herbivores to complete their lifecycle.
7.24.354	The black truffle—a prized gourmet delicacy—is the fruiting body of an underground mushroom.
7.24.355	Almost all truffles are ectomycorrhizal, and are usually found in close association with trees.
7.24.356	Animals eat truffles and disperse the spores.
7.24.357	In Italy and France, truffle hunters use female pigs to sniff out truffles.
7.24.358	Female pigs are attracted to truffles because the fungus releases a volatile compound closely related to a pheromone produced by male pigs.
7.24.359	Parasitism describes a symbiotic relationship in which one member of the association benefits at the expense of the other.
7.24.360	Both parasites and pathogens harm the host; however, the pathogen causes a disease, whereas the parasite usually does not.
7.24.361	Commensalism occurs when one member benefits without affecting the other.
7.24.362	Plant Parasites and Pathogens
7.24.363	The production of sufficient good-quality crops is essential to human existence.
7.24.364	Plant diseases have ruined crops, bringing widespread famine.
7.24.365	Many plant pathogens are fungi that cause tissue decay and eventual death of the host (Figure 24.25).
7.24.366	In addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins.
7.24.367	Fungi are also responsible for food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops.
7.24.368	For example, the fungus Claviceps purpurea causes ergot, a disease of cereal crops (especially of rye).
7.24.369	Although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot's alkaloid toxins on humans and animals are of much greater significance.
7.24.370	In animals, the disease is referred to as ergotism.
7.24.371	The most common signs and symptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle.
7.24.372	The active ingredient of ergot is lysergic acid, which is a precursor of the drug LSD.
7.24.373	Smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal pathogens that affect crops.
7.24.374	Some fungal pathogens include (a) green mold on grapefruit, (b) powdery mildew on a zinnia, (c) stem rust on a sheaf of barley, and
7.24.375	(d) grey rot on grapes.
7.24.376	In wet conditions Botrytis cinerea, the fungus that causes grey rot, can destroy a grape crop.
7.24.377	However, controlled infection of grapes by Botrytis results in noble rot, a condition that produces strong and much-prized dessert wines.
7.24.378	Aflatoxins are toxic, carcinogenic compounds released by fungi of the genus Aspergillus.
7.24.379	Periodically, harvests of nuts and grains are tainted by aflatoxins, leading to massive recall of produce.
7.24.380	This sometimes ruins producers and causes food shortages in developing countries.
7.24.381	Animal and Human Parasites and Pathogens Fungi can affect animals, including humans, in several ways.
7.24.382	A mycosis is a fungal disease that results from infection and direct damage.
7.24.383	Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues.
7.24.384	Mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans (and other animals) by foods contaminated by fungal toxins (mycotoxins).
7.24.385	Mycetismus describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms.
7.24.386	In addition, individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions.
7.24.387	Fungal infections are generally very difficult to treat because, unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotes.
7.24.388	Antibiotics only target prokaryotic cells, whereas compounds that kill fungi also harm the eukaryotic animal host.
7.24.389	Many fungal infections are superficial; that is, they occur on the animal’s skin.
7.24.390	Termed cutaneous (“skin”) mycoses, they can have devastating effects.
7.24.391	For example, the decline of the world’s frog population in recent years may be caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which infects the skin of frogs and presumably interferes with gaseous exchange.
7.24.392	Similarly, more than a million bats in the United States have been killed by white-nose syndrome, which appears as a white ring around the mouth of the bat.
7.24.393	It is caused by the cold-loving fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which disseminates its deadly spores in caves where bats hibernate.
7.24.394	Mycologists are researching the transmission, mechanism, and control of P. destructans to stop its spread.
7.24.395	Fungi that cause the superficial mycoses of the epidermis, hair, and nails rarely spread to the underlying tissue (Figure 24.26).
7.24.396	These fungi are often misnamed “dermatophytes”, from the Greek words dermis meaning skin and phyte meaning plant, although they are not plants.
7.24.397	Dermatophytes are also called “ringworms” because of the red ring they cause on skin.
7.24.398	They secrete extracellular enzymes that break down keratin (a protein found in hair, skin, and nails), causing conditions such as athlete’s foot and jock itch.
7.24.399	These conditions are usually treated with over-the-counter topical creams and powders, and are easily cleared.
7.24.400	More persistent superficial mycoses may require prescription oral medications.
7.24.401	Ringworm presents as a red ring on skin; (b) Trichophyton violaceum, shown in this bright field light micrograph, causes superficial mycoses on the scalp; (c) Histoplasma capsulatum is an ascomycete that infects airways and causes symptoms similar to influenza.
7.24.402	Systemic mycoses spread to internal organs, most commonly entering the body through the respiratory system.
7.24.403	For example, coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is commonly found in the southwestern United States, where the fungus resides in the dust.
7.24.404	Once inhaled, the spores develop in the lungs and cause symptoms similar to those of tuberculosis.
7.24.405	Histoplasmosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.
7.24.406	It also causes pulmonary infections, and in rarer cases, swelling of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord.
7.24.407	Treatment of these and many other fungal diseases requires the use of antifungal medications that have serious side effects.
7.24.408	Opportunistic mycoses are fungal infections that are either common in all environments, or part of the normal biota.
7.24.409	They mainly affect individuals who have a compromised immune system.
7.24.410	Patients in the late stages of AIDS suffer from opportunistic mycoses that can be life threatening.
7.24.411	The yeast Candida sp., a common member of the natural biota, can grow unchecked and infect the vagina or mouth (oral thrush) if the pH of the surrounding environment, the person’s immune defenses, or the normal population of bacteria are altered.
7.24.412	Mycetismus can occur when poisonous mushrooms are eaten.
7.24.413	It causes a number of human fatalities during mushroompicking season.
7.24.414	Many edible fruiting bodies of fungi resemble highly poisonous relatives, and amateur mushroom hunters are cautioned to carefully inspect their harvest and avoid eating mushrooms of doubtful origin.
7.24.415	The adage “there are bold mushroom pickers and old mushroom pickers, but are there no old, bold mushroom pickers
7.24.416	” is unfortunately true.
7.24.417	Although we often think of fungi as organisms that cause disease and rot food, fungi are important to human life on many levels.
7.24.418	As we have seen, they influence the well-being of human populations on a large scale because they are part of the nutrient cycle in ecosystems.
7.24.419	They have other ecosystem roles as well.
7.24.420	As animal pathogens, fungi help to control the population of damaging pests.
7.24.421	These fungi are very specific to the insects they attack, and do not infect animals or plants.
7.24.422	Fungi are currently under investigation as potential microbial insecticides, with several already on the market.
7.24.423	For example, the fungus Beauveria bassiana is a pesticide being tested as a possible biological control agent for the recent spread of emerald ash borer.
7.24.424	It has been released in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia and Maryland.
7.24.425	The emerald ash borer is an insect that attacks ash trees.
7.24.426	It is in turn parasitized by a pathogenic fungus that holds promise as a biological insecticide.
7.24.427	The parasitic fungus appears as white fuzz on the body of the insect.
7.24.428	The mycorrhizal relationship between fungi and plant roots is essential for the productivity of farm land.
7.24.429	Without the fungal partner in root systems, 80–90 percent of trees and grasses would not survive.
7.24.430	Mycorrhizal fungal inoculants are available as soil amendments from gardening supply stores and are promoted by supporters of organic agriculture.
7.24.431	We also eat some types of fungi.
7.24.432	Mushrooms figure prominently in the human diet.
7.24.433	Morels, shiitake mushrooms, chanterelles, and truffles are considered delicacies (Figure 24.28).
7.24.434	The humble meadow mushroom, Agaricus campestris, appears in many dishes.
7.24.435	Molds of the genus Penicillium ripen many cheeses.
7.24.436	They originate in the natural environment such as the caves of Roquefort, France, where wheels of sheep milk cheese are stacked in order to capture the molds responsible for the blue veins and pungent taste of the cheese.
7.24.437	The morel mushroom is an ascomycete much appreciated for its delicate taste.
7.24.438	Fermentation—of grains to produce beer, and of fruits to produce wine
7.24.439	—is an ancient art that humans in most cultures have practiced for millennia.
7.24.440	Wild yeasts are acquired from the environment and used to ferment sugars into CO2 and ethyl alcohol under anaerobic conditions.
7.24.441	It is now possible to purchase isolated strains of wild yeasts from different wine-making regions.
7.24.442	Louis Pasteur was instrumental in developing a reliable strain of brewer’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for the French brewing industry in the late 1850s.
7.24.443	This was one of the first examples of biotechnology patenting.
7.24.444	Many secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance.
7.24.445	Antibiotics are naturally produced by fungi to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, limiting their competition in the natural environment.
7.24.446	Important antibiotics, such as penicillin and the cephalosporins, are isolated from fungi.
7.24.447	Valuable drugs isolated from fungi include the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine (which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant), the precursors of steroid hormones, and ergot alkaloids used to stop bleeding.
7.24.448	Psilocybin is a compound found in fungi such as Psilocybe semilanceata and Gymnopilus junonius, which have been used for their hallucinogenic properties by various cultures for thousands of years.
7.24.449	As simple eukaryotic organisms, fungi are important model research organisms.
7.24.450	Many advances in modern genetics were achieved by the use of the red bread mold Neurospora crassa.
7.24.451	Additionally, many important genes originally discovered in S. cerevisiae served as a starting point in discovering analogous human genes.
7.24.452	As a eukaryotic organism, the yeast cell produces and modifies proteins in a manner similar to human cells, as opposed to the bacterium Escherichia coli, which lacks the internal membrane structures and enzymes to tag proteins for export.
7.24.453	This makes yeast a much better organism for use in recombinant DNA technology experiments.
7.24.454	Like bacteria, yeasts grow easily in culture, have a short generation time, and are amenable to genetic modification.
7.25.0	Seedless plants, like these horsetails (Equisetum sp.), thrive in damp, shaded environments under a tree canopy where dryness is rare.
7.25.1	An incredible variety of seedless plants populates the terrestrial landscape.
7.25.2	Mosses may grow on a tree trunk, and horsetails may display their jointed stems and spindly leaves across the forest floor.
7.25.3	Today, seedless plants represent only a small fraction of the plants in our environment; yet, three hundred million years ago, seedless plants dominated the landscape and grew in the enormous swampy forests of the Carboniferous period.
7.25.4	Their decomposition created large deposits of coal that we mine today.
7.25.5	Current evolutionary thought holds that all plants—green algae as well as land dwellers—are monophyletic; that is, they are descendants of a single common ancestor.
7.25.6	The evolutionary transition from water to land imposed severe constraints on plants.
7.25.7	They had to develop strategies to avoid drying out, to disperse reproductive cells in air, for structural support, and for capturing and filtering sunlight.
7.25.8	While seed plants developed adaptations that allowed them to populate even the most arid habitats on Earth, full independence from water did not happen in all plants.
7.25.9	Most seedless plants still require a moist environment.
7.25.10	The kingdom Plantae constitutes large and varied groups of organisms.
7.25.11	There are more than 300,000 species of catalogued plants.
7.25.12	Of these, more than 260,000 are seed plants.
7.25.13	Mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants are all members of the plant kingdom.
7.25.14	Most biologists also consider green algae to be plants, although others exclude all algae from the plant kingdom.
7.25.15	The reason for this disagreement stems from the fact that only green algae, the Charophytes, share common characteristics with land plants (such as using chlorophyll a and b plus carotene in the same proportion as plants).
7.25.16	These characteristics are absent in other types of algae.
7.25.17	Plant Adaptations to Life on Land
7.25.18	As organisms adapted to life on land, they had to contend with several challenges in the terrestrial environment.
7.25.19	Water has been described as “the stuff of life.
7.25.20	”
7.25.21	The cell’s interior is a watery soup: in this medium, most small molecules dissolve and diffuse, and the majority of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place.
7.25.22	Desiccation, or drying out, is a constant danger for an organism exposed to air.
7.25.23	Even when parts of a plant are close to a source of water, the aerial structures are likely to dry out.
7.25.24	Water also provides buoyancy to organisms.
7.25.25	On land, plants need to develop structural support in a medium that does not give the same lift as water.
7.25.26	The organism is also subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation, because air does not filter out ultraviolet rays of sunlight.
7.25.27	Additionally, the male gametes must reach the female gametes using new strategies, because swimming is no longer possible.
7.25.28	Therefore, both gametes and zygotes must be protected from desiccation.
7.25.29	The successful land plants developed strategies to deal with all of these challenges.
7.25.30	Not all adaptations appeared at once.
7.25.31	Some species never moved very far from the aquatic environment, whereas others went on to conquer the driest environments on Earth.
7.25.32	To balance these survival challenges, life on land offers several advantages.
7.25.33	First, sunlight is abundant.
7.25.34	Water acts as a filter, altering the spectral quality of light absorbed by the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll.
7.25.35	Second, carbon dioxide is more readily available in air than in water, since it diffuses faster in air.
7.25.36	Third, land plants evolved before land animals; therefore, until dry land was colonized by animals, no predators threatened plant life.
7.25.37	This situation changed as animals emerged from the water and fed on the abundant sources of nutrients in the established flora.
7.25.38	In turn, plants developed strategies to deter predation: from spines and thorns to toxic chemicals.
7.25.39	Early land plants, like the early land animals, did not live very far from an abundant source of water and developed survival strategies to combat dryness.
7.25.40	One of these strategies is called tolerance.
7.25.41	Many mosses, for example, can dry out to a brown and brittle mat, but as soon as rain or a flood makes water available, mosses will absorb it and are restored to their healthy green appearance.
7.25.42	Another strategy is to colonize environments with high humidity, where droughts are uncommon.
7.25.43	Ferns, which are considered an early lineage of plants, thrive in damp and cool places such as the understory of temperate forests.
7.25.44	Later, plants moved away from moist or aquatic environments using resistance to desiccation, rather than tolerance.
7.25.45	These plants, like cacti, minimize the loss of water to such an extent they can survive in extremely dry environments.
7.25.46	The most successful adaptation solution was the development of new structures that gave plants the advantage when colonizing new and dry environments.
7.25.47	Four major adaptations are found in all terrestrial plants: the alternation of generations, a sporangium in which the spores are formed, a gametangium that produces haploid cells, and apical meristem tissue in roots and shoots.
7.25.48	The evolution of a waxy cuticle and a cell wall with lignin also contributed to the success of land plants.
7.25.49	These adaptations are noticeably lacking in the closely related green algae—another reason for the debate over their placement in the plant kingdom.
7.25.50	Alternation of Generations Alternation of generations describes a life cycle in which an organism has both haploid and diploid multicellular stages.
7.25.51	Alternation of generations between the 1n gametophyte and 2n sporophyte is shown.
7.25.52	Haplontic refers to a lifecycle in which there is a dominant haploid stage, and diplontic refers to a lifecycle in which the diploid is the dominant life stage.
7.25.53	Humans are diplontic.
7.25.54	Most plants exhibit alternation of generations, which is described as haplodiplodontic: the haploid multicellular form, known as a gametophyte, is followed in the development sequence by a multicellular diploid organism: the sporophyte.
7.25.55	The gametophyte gives rise to the gametes (reproductive cells) by mitosis.
7.25.56	This can be the most obvious phase of the life cycle of the plant, as in the mosses, or it can occur in a microscopic structure, such as a pollen grain, in the higher plants (a common collective term for the vascular plants).
7.25.57	The sporophyte stage is barely noticeable in lower plants (the collective term for the plant groups of mosses, liverworts, and lichens).
7.25.58	Towering trees are the diplontic phase in the lifecycles of plants such as sequoias and pines.
7.25.59	Protection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants.
7.25.60	The vulnerable embryo must be sheltered from desiccation and other environmental hazards.
7.25.61	In both seedless and seed plants, the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to the embryo as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte.
7.25.62	This distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name of embryophytes.
7.25.63	Sporangia in Seedless Plants
7.25.64	The sporophyte of seedless plants is diploid and results from syngamy (fusion) of two gametes.
7.25.65	The sporophyte bears the sporangia (singular, sporangium):
7.25.66	organs that first appeared in the land plants.
7.25.67	The term “sporangia” literally means “spore in a vessel,” as it is a reproductive sac that contains spores Figure 25.3.
7.25.68	Inside the multicellular sporangia, the diploid sporocytes, or mother cells, produce haploid spores by meiosis, where the 2n chromosome number is reduced to 1n (note that many plant sporophytes are polyploid: for example, durum wheat is tetraploid,
7.25.69	bread wheat is hexaploid, and some ferns are 1000-ploid).
7.25.70	The spores are later released by the sporangia and disperse in the environment.
7.25.71	Two different types of spores are produced in land plants, resulting in the separation of sexes at different points in the lifecycle.
7.25.72	Seedless nonvascular plants produce only one kind of spore and are called homosporous.
7.25.73	The gametophyte phase is dominant in these plants.
7.25.74	After germinating from a spore, the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female gametangia, usually on the same individual.
7.25.75	In contrast, heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores.
7.25.76	The male spores are called microspores, because of their smaller size, and develop into the male gametophyte; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte.
7.25.77	Heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants.
7.25.78	Spore-producing sacs called sporangia grow at the ends of long, thin stalks in this photo of the moss Esporangios bryum.
7.25.79	When the haploid spore germinates in a hospitable environment, it generates a multicellular gametophyte by mitosis.
7.25.80	The gametophyte supports the zygote formed from the fusion of gametes and the resulting young sporophyte (vegetative form).
7.25.81	The cycle then begins anew.
7.25.82	The spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin.
7.25.83	This complex substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids: hence the yellow color of most pollen.
7.25.84	Sporopollenin is unusually resistant to chemical and biological degradation.
7.25.85	In seed plants, which use pollen to transfer the male sperm to the female egg, the toughness of sporopollenin explains the existence of well-preserved pollen fossils.
7.25.86	Sporopollenin was once thought to be an innovation of land plants; however, the green algae Coleochaetes forms spores that contain sporopollenin.
7.25.87	Gametangia in Seedless Plants Gametangia (singular, gametangium) are structures observed on multicellular haploid gametophytes.
7.25.88	In the gametangia, precursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis.
7.25.89	The male gametangium ( antheridium) releases sperm.
7.25.90	Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia: the female gametangium.
7.25.91	The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte.
7.25.92	Gametangia are prominent in seedless plants, but are very rarely found in seed plants.
7.25.93	Apical Meristems Shoots and roots of plants increase in length through rapid cell division in a tissue called the apical meristem, which is a small zone of cells found at the shoot tip or root tip (Figure 25.4).
7.25.94	The apical meristem is made of undifferentiated cells that continue to proliferate throughout the life of the plant.
7.25.95	Meristematic cells give rise to all the specialized tissues of the organism.
7.25.96	Elongation of the shoots and roots allows a plant to access additional space and resources: light in the case of the shoot, and water and minerals in the case of roots.
7.25.97	A separate meristem, called the lateral meristem, produces cells that increase the diameter of tree trunks.
7.25.98	Addition of new cells in a root occurs at the apical meristem.
7.25.99	Subsequent enlargement of these cells causes the organ to grow and elongate.
7.25.100	The root cap protects the fragile apical meristem as the root tip is pushed through the soil by cell elongation.
7.25.101	Additional Land Plant Adaptations
7.25.102	As plants adapted to dry land and became independent from the constant presence of water in damp habitats, new organs and structures made their appearance.
7.25.103	Early land plants did not grow more than a few inches off the ground, competing for light on these low mats.
7.25.104	By developing a shoot and growing taller, individual plants captured more light.
7.25.105	Because air offers substantially less support than water, land plants incorporated more rigid molecules in their stems (and later, tree trunks).
7.25.106	In small plants such as single-celled algae, simple diffusion suffices to distribute water and nutrients throughout the organism.
7.25.107	However, for plants to evolve larger forms, the evolution of vascular tissue for the distribution of water and solutes was a prerequisite.
7.25.108	The vascular system contains xylem and phloem tissues.
7.25.109	Xylem conducts water and minerals absorbed from the soil up to the shoot, while phloem transports food derived from photosynthesis throughout the entire plant.
7.25.110	A root system evolved to take up water and minerals from the soil, and to anchor the increasingly taller shoot in the soil.
7.25.111	In land plants, a waxy, waterproof cover called a cuticle protects the leaves and stems from desiccation.
7.25.112	However, the cuticle also prevents intake of carbon dioxide needed for the synthesis of carbohydrates through photosynthesis.
7.25.113	To overcome this, stomata or pores that open and close to regulate traffic of gases and water vapor appeared in plants as they moved away from moist environments into drier habitats.
7.25.114	Water filters ultraviolet-B (UVB) light, which is harmful to all organisms, especially those that must absorb light to survive.
7.25.115	This filtering does not occur for land plants.
7.25.116	This presented an additional challenge to land colonization, which was met by the evolution of biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of protective flavonoids and other compounds: pigments that absorb UV wavelengths of light and protect the aerial parts of plants from photodynamic damage.
7.25.117	Plants cannot avoid being eaten by animals.
7.25.118	Instead, they synthesize a large range of poisonous secondary metabolites: complex organic molecules such as alkaloids, whose noxious smells and unpleasant taste deter animals.
7.25.119	These toxic compounds can also cause severe diseases and even death, thus discouraging predation.
7.25.120	Humans have used many of these compounds for centuries as drugs, medications, or spices.
7.25.121	In contrast, as plants co-evolved with animals, the development of sweet and nutritious metabolites lured animals into providing valuable assistance in dispersing pollen grains, fruit, or seeds.
7.25.122	Plants have been enlisting animals to be their helpers in this way for hundreds of millions of years.
7.25.123	Evolution of Land Plants
7.25.124	No discussion of the evolution of plants on land can be undertaken without a brief review of the timeline of the geological eras.
7.25.125	The early era, known as the Paleozoic, is divided into six periods.
7.25.126	It starts with the Cambrian period, followed by the Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian.
7.25.127	The major event to mark the Ordovician, more than 500 million years ago, was the colonization of land by the ancestors of modern land plants.
7.25.128	Fossilized cells, cuticles, and spores of early land plants have been dated as far back as the Ordovician period in the early Paleozoic era.
7.25.129	The oldest-known vascular plants have been identified in deposits from the Devonian.
7.25.130	One of the richest sources of information is the Rhynie chert, a sedimentary rock deposit found in Rhynie, Scotland (Figure 25.5), where embedded fossils of some of the earliest vascular plants have been identified.
7.25.131	This Rhynie chert contains fossilized material from vascular plants.
7.25.132	The area inside the circle contains bulbous underground stems called corms, and root-like structures called rhizoids.
7.25.133	Paleobotanists distinguish between extinct species, as fossils, and extant species, which are still living.
7.25.134	The extinct vascular plants, classified as zosterophylls and trimerophytes, most probably lacked true leaves and roots and formed low vegetation mats similar in size to modern-day mosses, although some trimetophytes could reach one meter in height.
7.25.135	The later genus Cooksonia, which flourished during the Silurian, has been extensively studied from well-preserved examples.
7.25.136	Imprints of Cooksonia show slender branching stems ending in what appear to be sporangia.
7.25.137	From the recovered specimens, it is not possible to establish for certain whether Cooksonia possessed vascular tissues.
7.25.138	Fossils indicate that by the end of the Devonian period, ferns, horsetails, and seed plants populated the landscape, giving rising to trees and forests.
7.25.139	This luxuriant vegetation helped enrich the atmosphere in oxygen, making it easier for air-breathing animals to colonize dry land.
7.25.140	Plants also established early symbiotic relationships with fungi, creating mycorrhizae: a relationship in which the fungal network of filaments increases the efficiency of the plant root system, and the plants provide the fungi with byproducts of photosynthesis.
7.25.141	The Major Divisions of Land Plants
7.25.142	The green algae and land plants are grouped together into a subphylum called the Streptophytina, and thus are called Streptophytes.
7.25.143	In a further division, land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue, as detailed in Figure 25.6.
7.25.144	Plants that lack vascular tissue, which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients, are referred to as non-vascular plants.
7.25.145	Liverworts, mosses, and hornworts are seedless, non-vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution.
7.25.146	Vascular plants developed a network of cells that conduct water and solutes.
7.25.147	The first vascular plants appeared in the late Ordovician and were probably similar to lycophytes, which include club mosses (not to be confused with the mosses) and the pterophytes (ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns).
7.25.148	Lycophytes and pterophytes are referred to as seedless vascular plants, because they do not produce seeds.
7.25.149	The seed plants, or spermatophytes, form the largest group of all existing plants, and hence dominate the landscape.
7.25.150	Seed plants include gymnosperms, most notably conifers (Gymnosperms), which produce “naked seeds,” and the most successful of all plants, the flowering plants (Angiosperms).
7.25.151	Angiosperms protect their seeds inside chambers at the center of a flower; the walls of the chamber later develop into a fruit.
7.25.152	Streptophytes Until recently, all photosynthetic eukaryotes were considered members of the kingdom Plantae.
7.25.153	The brown, red, and gold algae, however, have been reassigned to the Protista kingdom.
7.25.154	This is because apart from their ability to capture light energy and fix CO2, they lack many structural and biochemical traits that distinguish plants from protists.
7.25.155	The position of green algae is more ambiguous.
7.25.156	Green algae contain the same carotenoids and chlorophyll a and b as land plants, whereas other algae have different accessory pigments and types of chlorophyll molecules in addition to chlorophyll a. Both green algae and land plants also store carbohydrates as starch.
7.25.157	Cells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts, and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes.
7.25.158	Consequently, land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta.
7.25.159	The remaining green algae, which belong to a group called Chlorophyta, include more than 7000 different species that live in fresh or brackish water, in seawater, or in snow patches.
7.25.160	A few green algae even survive on soil, provided it is covered by a thin film of moisture in which they can live.
7.25.161	Periodic dry spells provide a selective advantage to algae that can survive water stress.
7.25.162	Some green algae may already be familiar, in particular Spirogyra and desmids.
7.25.163	Their cells contain chloroplasts that display a dizzying variety of shapes, and their cell walls contain cellulose, as do land plants.
7.25.164	Some green algae are single cells, such as Chlorella and Chlamydomonas, which adds to the ambiguity of green algae classification, because plants are multicellular.
7.25.165	Other algae, like Ulva (commonly called sea lettuce), form colonies.
7.25.166	Chlorophyta include (a) Spirogyra, (b) desmids, (c) Chlamydomonas, and (d) Ulva.
7.25.167	Desmids and Chlamydomonas are single-celled organisms, Spirogyra forms chains of cells, and Ulva forms colonies resembling leaves.
7.25.168	Reproduction of Green Algae Green algae reproduce both asexually, by fragmentation or dispersal of spores, or sexually, by producing gametes that fuse during fertilization.
7.25.169	In a single-celled organism such as Chlamydomonas, there is no mitosis after fertilization.
7.25.170	In the multicellular Ulva, a sporophyte grows by mitosis after fertilization.
7.25.171	Both Chlamydomonas and Ulva produce flagellated gametes.
7.25.172	Charales Green algae in the order Charales, and the coleochaetes (microscopic green algae that enclose their spores in sporopollenin), are considered the closest living relatives of embryophytes.
7.25.173	The Charales can be traced back 420 million years.
7.25.174	They live in a range of fresh water habitats and vary in size from a few millimeters to a meter in length.
7.25.175	The representative species is Chara (Figure 25.8), often called muskgrass or skunkweed because of its unpleasant smell.
7.25.176	Large cells form the thallus: the main stem of the alga.
7.25.177	Branches arising from the nodes are made of smaller cells.
7.25.178	Male and female reproductive structures are found on the nodes, and the sperm have flagella.
7.25.179	Unlike land plants, Charales do not undergo alternation of generations in their lifecycle.
7.25.180	Charales exhibit a number of traits that are significant in their adaptation to land life.
7.25.181	They produce the compounds lignin and sporopollenin, and form plasmodesmata that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells.
7.25.182	The egg, and later, the zygote, form in a protected chamber on the parent plant.
7.25.183	The representative alga, Chara, is a noxious weed in Florida, where it clogs waterways.
7.25.184	New information from recent, extensive DNA sequence analysis of green algae indicates that the Zygnematales are more closely related to the embryophytes than the Charales.
7.25.185	The Zygnematales include the familiar genus Spirogyra.
7.25.186	As techniques in DNA analysis improve and new information on comparative genomics arises, the phylogenetic connections between species will change.
7.25.187	Clearly, plant biologists have not yet solved the mystery of the origin of land plants.
7.25.188	Bryophytes are the group of plants that are the closest extant relative of early terrestrial plants.
7.25.189	The first bryophytes (liverworts) most likely appeared in the Ordovician period, about 450 million years ago.
7.25.190	Because of the lack of lignin and other resistant structures, the likelihood of bryophytes forming fossils is rather small.
7.25.191	Some spores protected by sporopollenin have survived and are attributed to early bryophytes.
7.25.192	By the Silurian period, however, vascular plants had spread through the continents.
7.25.193	This compelling fact is used as evidence that non-vascular plants must have preceded the Silurian period.
7.25.194	More than 25,000 species of bryophytes thrive in mostly damp habitats, although some live in deserts.
7.25.195	They constitute the major flora of inhospitable environments like the tundra, where their small size and tolerance to desiccation offer distinct advantages.
7.25.196	They generally lack lignin and do not have actual tracheids (xylem cells specialized for water conduction).
7.25.197	Rather, water and nutrients circulate inside specialized conducting cells.
7.25.198	Although the term non-tracheophyte is more accurate, bryophytes are commonly called nonvascular plants.
7.25.199	In a bryophyte, all the conspicuous vegetative organs—including the photosynthetic leaf-like structures, the thallus, stem, and the rhizoid that anchors the plant to its substrate—belong to the haploid organism or gametophyte.
7.25.200	The sporophyte is barely noticeable.
7.25.201	The gametes formed by bryophytes swim with a flagellum, as do gametes in a few of the tracheophytes.
7.25.202	The sporangium—the multicellular sexual reproductive structure—is present in bryophytes and absent in the majority of algae.
7.25.203	The bryophyte embryo also remains attached to the parent plant, which protects and nourishes it.
7.25.204	This is a characteristic of land plants.
7.25.205	The bryophytes are divided into three phyla: the liverworts or Hepaticophyta, the hornworts or Anthocerotophyta, and the mosses or true Bryophyta.
7.25.206	Liverworts Liverworts (Hepaticophyta) are viewed as the plants most closely related to the ancestor that moved to land.
7.25.207	Liverworts have colonized every terrestrial habitat on Earth and diversified to more than 7000 existing species (Figure 25.9).
7.25.208	Some gametophytes form lobate green structures, as seen in Figure 25.10.
7.25.209	The shape is similar to the lobes of the liver, and hence provides the origin of the name given to the phylum.
7.25.210	This 1904 drawing shows the variety of forms of Hepaticophyta.
7.25.211	A liverwort, Lunularia cruciata, displays its lobate, flat thallus.
7.25.212	The organism in the photograph is in the gametophyte stage.
7.25.213	Openings that allow the movement of gases may be observed in liverworts.
7.25.214	However, these are not stomata, because they do not actively open and close.
7.25.215	The plant takes up water over its entire surface and has no cuticle to prevent desiccation.
7.25.216	Figure 25.11 represents the lifecycle of a liverwort.
7.25.217	The cycle starts with the release of haploid spores from the sporangium that developed on the sporophyte.
7.25.218	Spores disseminated by wind or water germinate into flattened thalli attached to the substrate by thin, single-celled filaments.
7.25.219	Male and female gametangia develop on separate, individual plants.
7.25.220	Once released, male gametes swim with the aid of their flagella to the female gametangium (the archegonium), and fertilization ensues.
7.25.221	The zygote grows into a small sporophyte still attached to the parent gametophyte.
7.25.222	It will give rise, by meiosis, to the next generation of spores.
7.25.223	Liverwort plants can also reproduce asexually, by the breaking of branches or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae.
7.25.224	In this latter type of reproduction, the gemmae—small, intact, complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus (shown in Figure 25.11)—are splashed out of the cup by raindrops.
7.25.225	The gemmae then land nearby and develop into gametophytes.
7.25.226	The life cycle of a typical liverwort is shown.
7.25.227	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.25.228	Hornworts
7.25.229	The hornworts (Anthocerotophyta) belong to the broad bryophyte group.
7.25.230	They have colonized a variety of habitats on land, although they are never far from a source of moisture.
7.25.231	The short, blue-green gametophyte is the dominant phase of the lifecycle of a hornwort.
7.25.232	The narrow, pipe-like sporophyte is the defining characteristic of the group.
7.25.233	The sporophytes emerge from the parent gametophyte and continue to grow throughout the life of the plant.
7.25.234	Hornworts grow a tall and slender sporophyte.
7.25.235	Stomata appear in the hornworts and are abundant on the sporophyte.
7.25.236	Photosynthetic cells in the thallus contain a single chloroplast.
7.25.237	Meristem cells at the base of the plant keep dividing and adding to its height.
7.25.238	Many hornworts establish symbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen from the environment.
7.25.239	The lifecycle of hornworts (Figure 25.13) follows the general pattern of alternation of generations.
7.25.240	The gametophytes grow as flat thalli on the soil with embedded gametangia.
7.25.241	Flagellated sperm swim to the archegonia and fertilize eggs.
7.25.242	The zygote develops into a long and slender sporophyte that eventually splits open, releasing spores.
7.25.243	Thin cells called pseudoelaters surround the spores and help propel them further in the environment.
7.25.244	Unlike the elaters observed in horsetails, the hornwort pseudoelaters are single-celled structures.
7.25.245	The haploid spores germinate and give rise to the next generation of gametophyte.
7.25.246	The alternation of generation in hornworts is shown.
7.25.247	Mosses More than 10,000 species of mosses have been catalogued.
7.25.248	Their habitats vary from the tundra, where they are the main vegetation, to the understory of tropical forests.
7.25.249	In the tundra, the mosses’ shallow rhizoids allow them to fasten to a substrate without penetrating the frozen soil.
7.25.250	Mosses slow down erosion, store moisture and soil nutrients, and provide shelter for small animals as well as food for larger herbivores, such as the musk ox.
7.25.251	Mosses are very sensitive to air pollution and are used to monitor air quality.
7.25.252	They are also sensitive to copper salts, so these salts are a common ingredient of compounds marketed to eliminate mosses from lawns.
7.25.253	Mosses form diminutive gametophytes, which are the dominant phase of the lifecycle.
7.25.254	Green, flat structures—resembling true leaves, but lacking vascular tissue—are attached in a spiral to a central stalk.
7.25.255	The plants absorb water and nutrients directly through these leaf-like structures.
7.25.256	Some mosses have small branches.
7.25.257	Some primitive traits of green algae, such as flagellated sperm, are still present in mosses that are dependent on water for reproduction.
7.25.258	Other features of mosses are clearly adaptations to dry land.
7.25.259	For example, stomata are present on the stems of the sporophyte, and a primitive vascular system runs up the sporophyte’s stalk.
7.25.260	Additionally, mosses are anchored to the substrate—whether it is soil, rock, or roof tiles—by multicellular rhizoids.
7.25.261	These structures are precursors of roots.
7.25.262	They originate from the base of the gametophyte, but are not the major route for the absorption of water and minerals.
7.25.263	The lack of a true root system explains why it is so easy to rip moss mats from a tree trunk.
7.25.264	The moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in Figure 25.14.
7.25.265	The most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte, which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema—usually, a tangle of single-celled filaments that hug the ground.
7.25.266	Cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore, consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliage-like structures.
7.25.267	Rhizoids form at the base of the gametophore.
7.25.268	Gametangia of both sexes develop on separate gametophores.
7.25.269	The male organ (the antheridium) produces many sperm, whereas the archegonium (the female organ) forms a single egg.
7.25.270	At fertilization, the sperm swims down the neck to the venter and unites with the egg inside the archegonium.
7.25.271	The zygote, protected by the archegonium, divides and grows into a sporophyte, still attached by its foot to the gametophyte.
7.25.272	The slender seta (plural, setae), as seen in Figure 25.15, contains tubular cells that transfer nutrients from the base of the sporophyte (the foot) to the sporangium or capsule.
7.25.273	This photograph shows the long slender stems, called setae, connected to capsules of the moss Thamnobryum alopecurum.
7.25.274	A structure called a peristome increases the spread of spores after the tip of the capsule falls off at dispersal.
7.25.275	The concentric tissue around the mouth of the capsule is made of triangular, close-fitting units, a little like “teeth”; these open and close depending on moisture levels, and periodically release spores.
7.25.276	The vascular plants, or tracheophytes, are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants.
7.25.277	More than 260,000 species of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earth’s vegetation.
7.25.278	Several evolutionary innovations explain their success and their ability to spread to all habitats.
7.25.279	Bryophytes may have been successful at the transition from an aquatic habitat to land, but they are still dependent on water for reproduction, and absorb moisture and nutrients through the gametophyte surface.
7.25.280	The lack of roots for absorbing water and minerals from the soil, as well as a lack of reinforced conducting cells, limits bryophytes to small sizes.
7.25.281	Although they may survive in reasonably dry conditions, they cannot reproduce and expand their habitat range in the absence of water.
7.25.282	Vascular plants, on the other hand, can achieve enormous heights, thus competing successfully for light.
7.25.283	Photosynthetic organs become leaves, and pipe-like cells or vascular tissues transport water, minerals, and fixed carbon throughout the organism.
7.25.284	In seedless vascular plants, the diploid sporophyte is the dominant phase of the lifecycle.
7.25.285	The gametophyte is now an inconspicuous, but still independent, organism.
7.25.286	Throughout plant evolution, there is an evident reversal of roles in the dominant phase of the lifecycle.
7.25.287	Seedless vascular plants still depend on water during fertilization, as the sperm must swim on a layer of moisture to reach the egg.
7.25.288	This step in reproduction explains why ferns and their relatives are more abundant in damp environments.
7.25.289	Vascular Tissue: Xylem and Phloem
7.25.290	The first fossils that show the presence of vascular tissue date to the Silurian period, about 430 million years ago.
7.25.291	The simplest arrangement of conductive cells shows a pattern of xylem at the center surrounded by phloem.
7.25.292	Xylem is the tissue responsible for the storage and long-distance transport of water and nutrients, as well as the transfer of water-soluble growth factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs.
7.25.293	The tissue consists of conducting cells, known as tracheids, and supportive filler tissue, called parenchyma.
7.25.294	Xylem conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls, and are thus described as lignified.
7.25.295	Lignin itself is a complex polymer that is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength to vascular tissue.
7.25.296	With their rigid cell walls, the xylem cells provide support to the plant and allow it to achieve impressive heights.
7.25.297	Tall plants have a selective advantage by being able to reach unfiltered sunlight and disperse their spores or seeds further away, thus expanding their range.
7.25.298	By growing higher than other plants, tall trees cast their shadow on shorter plants and limit competition for water and precious nutrients in the soil.
7.25.299	Phloem is the second type of vascular tissue; it transports sugars, proteins, and other solutes throughout the plant.
7.25.300	Phloem cells are divided into sieve elements (conducting cells) and cells that support the sieve elements.
7.25.301	Together, xylem and phloem tissues form the vascular system of plants.
7.25.302	Roots:
7.25.303	Support for the Plant Roots are not well preserved in the fossil record.
7.25.304	Nevertheless, it seems that roots appeared later in evolution than vascular tissue.
7.25.305	The development of an extensive network of roots represented a significant new feature of vascular plants.
7.25.306	Thin rhizoids attached bryophytes to the substrate, but these rather flimsy filaments did not provide a strong anchor for the plant; neither did they absorb substantial amounts of water and nutrients.
7.25.307	In contrast, roots, with their prominent vascular tissue system, transfer water and minerals from the soil to the rest of the plant.
7.25.308	The extensive network of roots that penetrates deep into the soil to reach sources of water also stabilizes trees by acting as a ballast or anchor.
7.25.309	The majority of roots establish a symbiotic relationship with fungi, forming mycorrhizae, which benefit the plant by greatly increasing the surface area for absorption of water and soil minerals and nutrients.
7.25.310	Leaves, Sporophylls, and Strobili A third innovation marks the seedless vascular plants.
7.25.311	Accompanying the prominence of the sporophyte and the development of vascular tissue, the appearance of true leaves improved their photosynthetic efficiency.
7.25.312	Leaves capture more sunlight with their increased surface area by employing more chloroplasts to trap light energy and convert it to chemical energy, which is then used to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates.
7.25.313	The carbohydrates are exported to the rest of the plant by the conductive cells of phloem tissue.
7.25.314	The existence of two types of morphology suggests that leaves evolved independently in several groups of plants.
7.25.315	The first type of leaf is the microphyll, or “little leaf,
7.25.316	” which can be dated to 350 million years ago in the late Silurian.
7.25.317	A microphyll is small and has a simple vascular system.
7.25.318	A single unbranched vein—a bundle of vascular tissue made of xylem and phloem—runs through the center of the leaf.
7.25.319	Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches, or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities.
7.25.320	Microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls, or “big leaves”, which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins.
7.25.321	Megaphylls most likely appeared independently several times during the course of evolution.
7.25.322	Their complex networks of veins suggest that several branches may have combined into a flattened organ, with the gaps between the branches being filled with photosynthetic tissue.
7.25.323	In addition to photosynthesis, leaves play another role in the life of the plants.
7.25.324	Pine cones, mature fronds of ferns, and flowers are all sporophylls—leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia.
7.25.325	Strobili are cone-like structures that contain sporangia.
7.25.326	They are prominent in conifers and are commonly known as pine cones.
7.25.327	Ferns and Other Seedless Vascular Plants
7.25.328	By the late Devonian period, plants had evolved vascular tissue, well-defined leaves, and root systems.
7.25.329	With these advantages, plants increased in height and size.
7.25.330	During the Carboniferous period, swamp forests of club mosses and horsetails—some specimens reaching heights of more than 30 m (100 ft)—covered most of the land.
7.25.331	These forests gave rise to the extensive coal deposits that gave the Carboniferous its name.
7.25.332	In seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte became the dominant phase of the lifecycle.
7.25.333	Water is still required for fertilization of seedless vascular plants, and most favor a moist environment.
7.25.334	Modern-day seedless tracheophytes include club mosses, horsetails, ferns, and whisk ferns.
7.25.335	Phylum Lycopodiophyta:
7.25.336	Club Mosses
7.25.337	The club mosses, or phylum Lycopodiophyta, are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants.
7.25.338	They dominated the landscape of the Carboniferous, growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests.
7.25.339	Today’s club mosses are diminutive, evergreen plants consisting of a stem (which may be branched) and microphylls (Figure 25.16).
7.25.340	The phylum Lycopodiophyta consists of close to 1,200 species, including the quillworts (Isoetales), the club mosses (Lycopodiales), and spike mosses (Selaginellales), none of which are true mosses or bryophytes.
7.25.341	Lycophytes follow the pattern of alternation of generations seen in the bryophytes, except that the sporophyte is the major stage of the lifecycle.
7.25.342	The gametophytes do not depend on the sporophyte for nutrients.
7.25.343	Some gametophytes develop underground and form mycorrhizal associations with fungi.
7.25.344	In club mosses, the sporophyte gives rise to sporophylls arranged in strobili, cone-like structures that give the class its name.
7.25.345	Lycophytes can be homosporous or heterosporous.
7.25.346	In the club mosses such as Lycopodium clavatum, sporangia are arranged in clusters called strobili.
7.25.347	Phylum Monilophyta: Class Equisetopsida (Horsetails) Horsetails, whisk ferns and ferns belong to the phylum Monilophyta, with horsetails placed in the Class Equisetopsida.
7.25.348	The single genus Equisetum is the survivor of a large group of plants, known as Arthrophyta, which produced large trees and entire swamp forests in the Carboniferous.
7.25.349	The plants are usually found in damp environments and marshes.
7.25.350	Horsetails thrive in a marsh.
7.25.351	The stem of a horsetail is characterized by the presence of joints or nodes, hence the name Arthrophyta (arthro- = "joint"; -phyta = "plant").
7.25.352	Leaves and branches come out as whorls from the evenly spaced joints.
7.25.353	The needle-shaped leaves do not contribute greatly to photosynthesis, the majority of which takes place in the green stem.
7.25.354	Thin leaves originating at the joints are noticeable on the horsetail plant.
7.25.355	Horsetails were once used as scrubbing brushes and were nicknamed scouring brushes.
7.25.356	Silica collects in the epidermal cells, contributing to the stiffness of horsetail plants.
7.25.357	Underground stems known as rhizomes anchor the plants to the ground.
7.25.358	Modern-day horsetails are homosporous and produce bisexual gametophytes.
7.25.359	Phylum Monilophyta:
7.25.360	Class Psilotopsida (Whisk Ferns)
7.25.361	While most ferns form large leaves and branching roots, the whisk ferns, Class Psilotopsida, lack both roots and leaves, probably lost by reduction.
7.25.362	Photosynthesis takes place in their green stems, and small yellow knobs form at the tip of the branch stem and contain the sporangia.
7.25.363	Whisk ferns were considered an early pterophytes.
7.25.364	However, recent comparative DNA analysis suggests that this group may have lost both vascular tissue and roots through evolution, and is more closely related to ferns.
7.25.365	The whisk fern Psilotum nudum has conspicuous green stems with knob-shaped sporangia.
7.25.366	Phylum Monilophyta: Class Psilotopsida (Ferns)
7.25.367	With their large fronds, ferns are the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants.
7.25.368	They are considered the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants.
7.25.369	More than 20,000 species of ferns live in environments ranging from tropics to temperate forests.
7.25.370	Although some species survive in dry environments, most ferns are restricted to moist, shaded places.
7.25.371	Ferns made their appearance in the fossil record during the Devonian period and expanded during the Carboniferous.
7.25.372	The dominant stage of the lifecycle of a fern is the sporophyte, which consists of large compound leaves called fronds.
7.25.373	Fronds fulfill a double role; they are photosynthetic organs that also carry reproductive organs.
7.25.374	The stem may be buried underground as a rhizome, from which adventitious roots grow to absorb water and nutrients from the soil; or, they may grow above ground as a trunk in tree ferns (Figure 25.20).
7.25.375	Adventitious organs are those that grow in unusual places, such as roots growing from the side of a stem.
7.25.376	Some specimens of this short tree-fern species can grow very tall.
7.25.377	The tip of a developing fern frond is rolled into a crozier, or fiddlehead (Figure 25.21a and Figure 25.21b).
7.25.378	Fiddleheads unroll as the frond develops.
7.25.379	Croziers, or fiddleheads, are the tips of fern fronds.
7.25.380	Most ferns produce the same type of spores and are therefore homosporous.
7.25.381	The diploid sporophyte is the most conspicuous stage of the lifecycle.
7.25.382	On the underside of its mature fronds, sori (singular, sorus) form as small clusters where sporangia develop.
7.25.383	Sori appear as small bumps on the underside of a fern frond.
7.25.384	Inside the sori, spores are produced by meiosis and released into the air.
7.25.385	Those that land on a suitable substrate germinate and form a heart-shaped gametophyte, which is attached to the ground by thin filamentous rhizoids.
7.25.386	Shown here are a young sporophyte (upper part of image) and a heart-shaped gametophyte.
7.25.387	The inconspicuous gametophyte harbors both sex gametangia.
7.25.388	Flagellated sperm released from the antheridium swim on a wet surface to the archegonium, where the egg is fertilized.
7.25.389	The newly formed zygote grows into a sporophyte that emerges from the gametophyte and grows by mitosis into the next generation sporophyte.
7.25.390	This landscaped border at a college campus was designed by students in the horticulture and landscaping department of the college.
7.25.391	The Importance of Seedless Vascular Plants Mosses and liverworts are often the first macroscopic organisms to colonize an area, both in a primary succession—where bare land is settled for the first time by living organisms—or in a secondary succession, where soil remains intact after a catastrophic event wipes out many existing species.
7.25.392	Their spores are carried by the wind, birds, or insects.
7.25.393	Once mosses and liverworts are established, they provide food and shelter for other species.
7.25.394	In a hostile environment, like the tundra where the soil is frozen, bryophytes grow well because they do not have roots and can dry and rehydrate rapidly once water is again available.
7.25.395	Mosses are at the base of the food chain in the tundra biome.
7.25.396	Many species—from small insects to musk oxen and reindeer—depend on mosses for food.
7.25.397	In turn, predators feed on the herbivores, which are the primary consumers.
7.25.398	Some reports indicate that bryophytes make the soil more amenable to colonization by other plants.
7.25.399	Because they establish symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, mosses replenish the soil with nitrogen.
7.25.400	At the end of the nineteenth century, scientists observed that lichens and mosses were becoming increasingly rare in urban and suburban areas.
7.25.401	Since bryophytes have neither a root system for absorption of water and nutrients, nor a cuticle layer that protects them from desiccation, pollutants in rainwater readily penetrate their tissues; they absorb moisture and nutrients through their entire exposed surfaces.
7.25.402	Therefore, pollutants dissolved in rainwater penetrate plant tissues readily and have a larger impact on mosses than on other plants.
7.25.403	The disappearance of mosses can be considered a bioindicator for the level of pollution in the environment.
7.25.404	Ferns contribute to the environment by promoting the weathering of rock, accelerating the formation of topsoil, and slowing down erosion by spreading rhizomes in the soil.
7.25.405	The water ferns of the genus
7.25.406	Azolla harbor nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and restore this important nutrient to aquatic habitats.
7.25.407	Seedless plants have historically played a role in human life through uses as tools, fuel, and medicine.
7.25.408	Dried peat moss, Sphagnum, is commonly used as fuel in some parts of Europe and is considered a renewable resource.
7.25.409	Sphagnum bogs (Figure 25.26) are cultivated with cranberry and blueberry bushes.
7.25.410	The ability of Sphagnum to hold moisture makes the moss a common soil conditioner.
7.25.411	Florists use blocks of Sphagnum to maintain moisture for floral arrangements.
7.25.412	Sphagnum acutifolium is dried peat moss and can be used as fuel.
7.25.413	The attractive fronds of ferns make them a favorite ornamental plant.
7.25.414	Because they thrive in low light, they are well suited as house plants.
7.25.415	More importantly, fiddleheads are a traditional spring food of Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest, and are popular as a side dish in French cuisine.
7.25.416	The licorice fern, Polypodium glycyrrhiza, is part of the diet of the Pacific Northwest coastal tribes, owing in part to the sweetness of its rhizomes.
7.25.417	It has a faint licorice taste and serves as a sweetener.
7.25.418	The rhizome also figures in the pharmacopeia of Native Americans for its medicinal properties and is used as a remedy for sore throat.
7.25.419	By far the greatest impact of seedless vascular plants on human life, however, comes from their extinct progenitors.
7.25.420	The tall club mosses, horsetails, and tree-like ferns that flourished in the swampy forests of the Carboniferous period gave rise to large deposits of coal throughout the world.
7.25.421	Coal provided an abundant source of energy during the Industrial Revolution, which had tremendous consequences on human societies, including rapid technological progress and growth of large cities, as well as the degradation of the environment.
7.25.422	Coal is still a prime source of energy and also a major contributor to global warming.
7.26.0	Seed plants dominate the landscape and play an integral role in human societies.
7.26.1	(a) Palm trees grow along the shoreline; (b) wheat is a crop grown in most of the world; (c) the flower of the cotton plant produces fibers that are woven into fabric; (d) the potent alkaloids of the beautiful opium poppy have influenced human life both as a medicinal remedy and as a dangerously addictive drug.
7.26.2	The lush palms on tropical shorelines do not depend on water for the dispersal of their pollen, fertilization, or the survival of the zygote—unlike mosses, liverworts, and ferns of the terrain.
7.26.3	Seed plants, such as palms, have broken free from the need to rely on water for their reproductive needs.
7.26.4	They play an integral role in all aspects of life on the planet, shaping the physical terrain, influencing the climate, and maintaining life as we know it.
7.26.5	For millennia, human societies have depended on seed plants for nutrition and medicinal compounds: and more recently, for industrial by-products, such as timber and paper, dyes, and textiles.
7.26.6	Palms provide materials including rattans, oils, and dates.
7.26.7	Wheat is grown to feed both human and animal populations.
7.26.8	The fruit of the cotton boll flower is harvested as a boll, with its fibers transformed into clothing or pulp for paper.
7.26.9	The showy opium poppy is valued both as an ornamental flower and as a source of potent opiate compounds.
7.26.10	The first plants to colonize land were most likely closely related to modern day mosses (bryophytes) and are thought to have appeared about 500 million years ago.
7.26.11	They were followed by liverworts (also bryophytes) and primitive vascul plants—the pterophytes—from which modern ferns are derived.
7.26.12	The lifecycle of bryophytes and pterophytes is characterized by the alternation of generations, like gymnosperms and angiosperms; what sets bryophytes and pterophytes apart from gymnosperms and angiosperms is their reproductive requirement for water.
7.26.13	The completion of the bryophyte and pterophyte life cycle requires water because the male gametophyte releases sperm, which must swim—propelled by their flagella—to reach and fertilize the female gamete or egg.
7.26.14	After fertilization, the zygote matures and grows into a sporophyte, which in turn will form sporangia or "spore vessels.
7.26.15	"
7.26.16	In the sporangia, mother cells undergo meiosis and produce the haploid spores.
7.26.17	Release of spores in a suitable environment will lead to germination and a new generation of gametophytes.
7.26.18	In seed plants, the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation, and at the same time, a systematic reduction in the size of the gametophyte: from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic cluster of cells enclosed in the tissues of the sporophyte.
7.26.19	Whereas lower vascular plants, such as club mosses and ferns, are mostly homosporous (produce only one type of spore), all seed plants, or spermatophytes, are heterosporous.
7.26.20	They form two types of spores: megaspores (female) and microspores (male).
7.26.21	Megaspores develop into female gametophytes that produce eggs, and microspores mature into male gametophytes that generate sperm.
7.26.22	Because the gametophytes mature within the spores, they are not free-living, as are the gametophytes of other seedless vascular plants.
7.26.23	Heterosporous seedless plants are seen as the evolutionary forerunners of seed plants.
7.26.24	Seeds and pollen—two critical adaptations to drought, and to reproduction that
7.26.25	doesn’t require water—distinguish seed plants from other (seedless) vascular plants.
7.26.26	Both adaptations were required for the colonization of land begun by the bryophytes and their ancestors.
7.26.27	Fossils place the earliest distinct seed plants at about 350 million years ago.
7.26.28	The first reliable record of gymnosperms dates their appearance to the Pennsylvanian period, about 319 million years ago (Figure 26.2).
7.26.29	Gymnosperms were preceded by progymnosperms, the first naked seed plants, which arose about 380 million years ago.
7.26.30	Progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers (cone bearers) because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues; however, they still reproduced like ferns, releasing spores into the environment.
7.26.31	Gymnosperms dominated the landscape in the early (Triassic) and middle (Jurassic) Mesozoic era.
7.26.32	Angiosperms surpassed gymnosperms by the middle of the Cretaceous (about 100 million years ago) in the late Mesozoic era, and today are the most abundant plant group in most terrestrial biomes.
7.26.33	Various plant species evolved in different eras.
7.26.34	Pollen and seed were innovative structures that allowed seed plants to break their dependence on water for reproduction and development of the embryo, and to conquer dry land.
7.26.35	The pollen grains are the male gametophytes, which contain the sperm (gametes) of the plant.
7.26.36	The small haploid (1n) cells are encased in a protective coat that prevents desiccation (drying out) and mechanical damage.
7.26.37	Pollen grains can travel far from their original sporophyte, spreading the plant’s genes.
7.26.38	The seed offers the embryo protection, nourishment, and a mechanism to maintain dormancy for tens or even thousands of years, ensuring germination can occur when growth conditions are optimal.
7.26.39	Seeds therefore allow plants to disperse the next generation through both space and time.
7.26.40	With such evolutionary advantages, seed plants have become the most successful and familiar group of plants, in part because of their size and striking appearance.
7.26.41	Evolution of Gymnosperms
7.26.42	The fossil plant Elkinsia polymorpha, a "seed fern" from the Devonian period—about 400 million years ago—is considered the earliest seed plant known to date.
7.26.43	Seed ferns (Figure 26.3) produced their seeds along their branches without specialized structures.
7.26.44	What makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called cupules to enclose and protect the ovule—the female gametophyte and associated tissues—which develops into a seed upon fertilization.
7.26.45	Seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the Carboniferous period.
7.26.46	This fossilized leaf is from Glossopteris, a seed fern that thrived during the Permian age (290–240 million years ago).
7.26.47	Fossil records indicate the first gymnosperms (progymnosperms) most likely originated in the Paleozoic era, during the middle Devonian period: about 390 million years ago.
7.26.48	Following the wet Mississippian and Pennsylvanian periods, which were dominated by giant fern trees, the Permian period was dry.
7.26.49	This gave a reproductive edge to seed plants, which are better adapted to survive dry spells.
7.26.50	The Ginkgoales, a group of gymnosperms with only one surviving species—the Gingko biloba—were the first gymnosperms to appear during the lower Jurassic.
7.26.51	Gymnosperms expanded in the Mesozoic era (about 240 million years ago), supplanting ferns in the landscape, and reaching their greatest diversity during this time.
7.26.52	The Jurassic period was as much the age of the cycads (palm-tree-like gymnosperms) as the age of the dinosaurs.
7.26.53	Gingkoales and the more familiar conifers also dotted the landscape.
7.26.54	Although angiosperms (flowering plants) are the major form of plant life in most biomes, gymnosperms still dominate some ecosystems, such as the taiga (boreal forests) and the alpine forests at higher mountain elevations (Figure 26.4) because of their adaptation to cold and dry growth conditions.
7.26.55	This boreal forest (taiga) has low-lying plants and conifer trees.
7.26.56	Seeds and Pollen as an Evolutionary Adaptation to Dry Land
7.26.57	Unlike bryophyte and fern spores (which are haploid cells dependent on moisture for rapid development of gametophytes), seeds contain a diploid embryo that will germinate into a sporophyte.
7.26.58	Storage tissue to sustain growth and a protective coat give seeds their superior evolutionary advantage.
7.26.59	Several layers of hardened tissue prevent desiccation, and free reproduction from the need for a constant supply of water.
7.26.60	Furthermore, seeds remain in a state of dormancy—induced by desiccation and the hormone
7.26.61	abscisic acid—until conditions for growth become favorable.
7.26.62	Whether blown by the wind, floating on water, or carried away by animals, seeds are scattered in an expanding geographic range, thus avoiding competition with the parent plant.
7.26.63	Pollen grains (Figure 26.5) are male gametophytes and are carried by wind, water, or a pollinator.
7.26.64	The whole structure is protected from desiccation and can reach the female organs without dependence on water.
7.26.65	Male gametes reach female gametophyte and the egg cell gamete though a pollen tube: an extension of a cell within the pollen grain.
7.26.66	The sperm of modern gymnosperms lack flagella, but in cycads and the Gingko, the sperm still possess flagella that allow them to swim down the pollen tube to the female gamete; however, they are enclosed in a pollen grain.
7.26.67	This fossilized pollen is from a Buckbean fen core found in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.
7.26.68	The pollen is magnified 1,054 times.
7.26.69	Evolution of Angiosperms Undisputed fossil records place the massive appearance and diversification of angiosperms in the middle to late Mesozoic era.
7.26.70	Angiosperms (“seed in a vessel”) produce a flower containing male and/or female reproductive structures.
7.26.71	Fossil evidence (Figure 26.6) indicates that flowering plants first appeared in the Lower Cretaceous, about 125 million years ago, and were rapidly diversifying by the Middle Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago.
7.26.72	Earlier traces of angiosperms are scarce.
7.26.73	Fossilized pollen recovered from Jurassic geological material has been attributed to angiosperms.
7.26.74	A few early Cretaceous rocks show clear imprints of leaves resembling angiosperm leaves.
7.26.75	By the mid-Cretaceous, a staggering number of diverse flowering plants crowd the fossil record.
7.26.76	The same geological period is also marked by the appearance of many modern groups of insects, including pollinating insects that played a key role in ecology and the evolution of flowering plants.
7.26.77	Although several hypotheses have been offered to explain this sudden profusion and variety of flowering plants, none have garnered the consensus of paleobotanists (scientists who study ancient plants).
7.26.78	New data in comparative genomics and paleobotany have, however, shed some light on the evolution of angiosperms.
7.26.79	Rather than being derived from gymnosperms, angiosperms form a sister clade (a species and its descendents) that developed in parallel with the gymnosperms.
7.26.80	The two innovative structures of flowers and fruit represent an improved reproductive strategy that served to protect the embryo, while increasing genetic variability and range.
7.26.81	Paleobotanists debate whether angiosperms evolved from small woody bushes, or were basal angiosperms related to tropical grasses.
7.26.82	Both views draw support from cladistics studies, and the so-called woody magnoliid hypothesis—which proposes that the early ancestors of angiosperms were shrubs—also offers molecular biological evidence.
7.26.83	The most primitive living angiosperm is considered to be Amborella trichopoda, a small plant native to the rainforest of New Caledonia, an island in the South Pacific.
7.26.84	Analysis of the genome of A. trichopoda has shown that it is related to all existing flowering plants and belongs to the oldest confirmed branch of the angiosperm family tree.
7.26.85	A few other angiosperm groups called basal angiosperms, are viewed as primitive because they branched off early from the phylogenetic tree.
7.26.86	Most modern angiosperms are classified as either monocots or eudicots, based on the structure of their leaves and embryos.
7.26.87	Basal angiosperms, such as water lilies, are considered more primitive because they share morphological traits with both monocots and eudicots.
7.26.88	This leaf imprint shows a Ficus speciosissima, an angiosperm that flourished during the Cretaceous period.
7.26.89	Flowers and Fruits as an Evolutionary Adaptation Angiosperms produce their gametes in separate organs, which are usually housed in a flower.
7.26.90	Both fertilization and embryo development take place inside an anatomical structure that provides a stable system of sexual reproduction largely sheltered from environmental fluctuations.
7.26.91	Flowering plants are the most diverse phylum on Earth after insects; flowers come in a bewildering array of sizes, shapes, colors, smells, and arrangements.
7.26.92	Most flowers have a mutualistic pollinator, with the distinctive features of flowers reflecting the nature of the pollination agent.
7.26.93	The relationship between pollinator and flower characteristics is one of the great examples of coevolution.
7.26.94	Following fertilization of the egg, the ovule grows into a seed.
7.26.95	The surrounding tissues of the ovary thicken, developing into a fruit that will protect the seed and often ensure its dispersal over a wide geographic range.
7.26.96	Not all fruits develop from an ovary; such structures are “false fruits.
7.26.97	”
7.26.98	Like flowers, fruit can vary tremendously in appearance, size, smell, and taste.
7.26.99	Tomatoes, walnut shells and avocados are all examples of fruit.
7.26.100	As with pollen and seeds, fruits also act as agents of dispersal.
7.26.101	Some may be carried away by the wind.
7.26.102	Many attract animals that will eat the fruit and pass the seeds through their digestive systems, then deposit the seeds in another location.
7.26.103	Cockleburs are covered with stiff, hooked spines that can hook into fur (or clothing) and hitch a ride on an animal for long distances.
7.26.104	The cockleburs that clung to the velvet trousers of an enterprising Swiss hiker, George de Mestral, inspired his invention of the loop and hook fastener he named Velcro.
7.26.105	Gymnosperms, meaning “naked seeds,” are a diverse group of seed plants and are paraphyletic.
7.26.106	Paraphyletic groups are those in which not all members are descendants of a single common ancestor.
7.26.107	Their characteristics include naked seeds, separate female and male gametes, pollination by wind, and tracheids (which transport water and solutes in the vascular system).
7.26.108	Gymnosperm seeds are not enclosed in an ovary; rather, they are exposed on cones or modified leaves.
7.26.109	Sporophylls are specialized leaves that produce sporangia.
7.26.110	The term strobilus (plural = strobili) describes a tight arrangement of sporophylls around a central stalk, as seen in cones.
7.26.111	Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation.
7.26.112	The layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium, and later, the embryo, is called the integument.
7.26.113	Gymnosperms were the dominant phylum in Mesozoic era.
7.26.114	They are adapted to live where fresh water is scarce during part of the year, or in the nitrogen-poor soil of a bog.
7.26.115	Therefore, they are still the prominent phylum in the coniferous biome or taiga, where the evergreen conifers have a selective advantage in cold and dry weather.
7.26.116	Evergreen conifers continue low levels of photosynthesis during the cold months, and are ready to take advantage of the first sunny days of spring.
7.26.117	One disadvantage is that conifers are more susceptible than deciduous trees to infestations because conifers do not lose their leaves all at once.
7.26.118	They cannot, therefore, shed parasites and restart with a fresh supply of leaves in spring.
7.26.119	The life cycle of a gymnosperm involves alternation of generations, with a dominant sporophyte in which the female gametophyte resides, and reduced gametophytes.
7.26.120	All gymnosperms are heterosporous.
7.26.121	The male and female reproductive organs can form in cones or strobili.
7.26.122	Male and female sporangia are produced either on the same plant, described as monoecious (“one home” or bisexual), or on separate plants, referred to as dioecious (“two homes” or unisexual) plants.
7.26.123	The life cycle of a conifer will serve as our example of reproduction in gymnosperms.
7.26.124	Life Cycle of a Conifer Pine trees are conifers (cone bearing) and carry both male and female sporophylls on the same mature sporophyte.
7.26.125	Therefore, they are monoecious plants.
7.26.126	Like all gymnosperms, pines are heterosporous and generate two different types of spores: male microspores and female megaspores.
7.26.127	In the male cones, or staminate cones, the microsporocytes give rise to pollen grains by meiosis.
7.26.128	In the spring, large amounts of yellow pollen are released and carried by the wind.
7.26.129	Some gametophytes will land on a female cone.
7.26.130	Pollination is defined as the initiation of pollen tube growth.
7.26.131	The pollen tube develops slowly, and the generative cell in the pollen grain divides into two haploid sperm cells by mitosis.
7.26.132	At fertilization, one of the sperm cells will finally unite its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of a haploid egg cell.
7.26.133	Female cones, or ovulate cones, contain two ovules per scale.
7.26.134	One megaspore mother cell, or megasporocyte, undergoes meiosis in each ovule.
7.26.135	Three of the four cells break down; only a single surviving cell will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte, which encloses archegonia (an archegonium is a reproductive organ that contains a single large egg).
7.26.136	Upon fertilization, the diploid egg will give rise to the embryo, which is enclosed in a seed coat of tissue from the parent plant.
7.26.137	Fertilization and seed development is a long process in pine trees: it may take up to two years after pollination.
7.26.138	The seed that is formed contains three generations of tissues: the seed coat that originates from the sporophyte tissue, the gametophyte that will provide nutrients, and the embryo itself.
7.26.139	Figure 26.8 illustrates the life cycle of a conifer.
7.26.140	The sporophyte (2n) phase is the longest phase in the life of a gymnosperm.
7.26.141	The gametophytes (1n)—microspores and megaspores—are reduced in size.
7.26.142	It may take more than year between pollination and fertilization while the pollen tube grows towards the megasporocyte (2n), which undergoes meiosis into megaspores.
7.26.143	The megaspores will mature into eggs (1n).
7.26.144	Diversity of Gymnosperms Modern gymnosperms are classified into four phyla.
7.26.145	Coniferophyta, Cycadophyta, and Ginkgophyta are similar in their production of secondary cambium (cells that generate the vascular system of the trunk or stem and are partially specialized for water transportation) and their pattern of seed development.
7.26.146	However, the three phyla are not closely related phylogenetically to each other.
7.26.147	Gnetophyta are considered the closest group to angiosperms because they produce true xylem tissue.
7.26.148	Conifers (Coniferophyta) Conifers are the dominant phylum of gymnosperms, with the most variety of species (Figure 26.9).
7.26.149	Most are typically tall trees that usually bear scale-like or needle-like leaves.
7.26.150	Water evaporation from leaves is reduced by their thin shape and the thick cuticle.
7.26.151	Snow slides easily off needle-shaped leaves, keeping the load light and decreasing breaking of branches.
7.26.152	Adaptations to cold and dry weather explain the predominance of conifers at high altitudes and in cold climates.
7.26.153	Conifers include familiar evergreen trees such as pines, spruces, firs, cedars, sequoias, and yews.
7.26.154	A few species are deciduous and lose their leaves in fall.
7.26.155	The European larch and the tamarack are examples of deciduous conifers (Figure 26.9c).
7.26.156	Many coniferous trees are harvested for paper pulp and timber.
7.26.157	The wood of conifers is more primitive than the wood of angiosperms; it contains tracheids, but no vessel elements, and is therefore referred to as “soft wood.
7.26.158	”
7.26.159	Conifers are the dominant form of vegetation in cold or arid environments and at high altitudes.
7.26.160	Shown here are the (a) evergreen spruce Picea sp.
7.26.161	,
7.26.162	(b) juniper Juniperus sp.
7.26.163	, (c) sequoia Sequoia Semervirens, which is a deciduous gymnosperm, and (d) the tamarack Larix larcinia.
7.26.164	Notice the yellow leaves of the tamarack.
7.26.165	Cycads Cycads thrive in mild climates, and are often mistaken for palms because of the shape of their large, compound leaves.
7.26.166	Cycads bear large cones (Figure 26.10), and may be pollinated by beetles rather than wind: unusual for a gymnosperm.
7.26.167	They dominated the landscape during the age of dinosaurs in the Mesozoic, but only a hundred or so species persisted to modern times.
7.26.168	They face possible extinction, and several species are protected through international conventions.
7.26.169	Because of their attractive shape, they are often used as ornamental plants in gardens in the tropics and subtropics.
7.26.170	This Encephalartos ferox cycad has large cones and broad, fern-like leaves.
7.26.171	Gingkophytes
7.26.172	The single surviving species of the gingkophytes group is the Gingko biloba (Figure 26.11).
7.26.173	Its fan-shaped leaves—unique among seed plants because they feature a dichotomous venation pattern—turn yellow in autumn and fall from the tree.
7.26.174	For centuries, G. biloba was cultivated by Chinese Buddhist monks in monasteries, which ensured its preservation.
7.26.175	It is planted in public spaces because it is unusually resistant to pollution.
7.26.176	Male and female organs are produced on separate plants.
7.26.177	Typically, gardeners plant only male trees because the seeds produced by the female plant have an off-putting smell of rancid butter.
7.26.178	This plate from the 1870 book Flora Japonica, Sectio Prima (Tafelband) depicts the leaves and fruit of Gingko biloba, as drawn by Philipp Franz von Siebold and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini.
7.26.179	Gnetophytes Gnetophytes are the closest relative to modern angiosperms, and include three dissimilar genera of plants: Ephedra, Gnetum, and Welwitschia (Figure 26.12).
7.26.180	Like angiosperms, they have broad leaves.
7.26.181	In tropical and subtropical zones, gnetophytes are vines or small shrubs.
7.26.182	Ephedra occurs in dry areas of the West Coast of the United States and Mexico.
7.26.183	Ephedra’s small, scale-like leaves are the source of the compound ephedrine, which is used in medicine as a potent decongestant.
7.26.184	Because ephedrine is similar to amphetamines, both in chemical structure and neurological effects, its use is restricted to prescription drugs.
7.26.185	Like angiosperms, but unlike other gymnosperms, all gnetophytes possess vessel elements in their xylem.
7.26.186	Ephedra viridis, known by the common name Mormon tea, grows on the West Coast of the United States and Mexico.
7.26.187	(b) Gnetum gnemon grows in Malaysia.
7.26.188	(c)
7.26.189	The large Welwitschia mirabilis can be found in the Namibian desert.
7.26.190	From their humble and still obscure beginning during the early Jurassic period, the angiosperms—or flowering plants—have evolved to dominate most terrestrial ecosystems (Figure 26.13).
7.26.191	With more than 250,000 species, the angiosperm phylum (Anthophyta) is second only to insects in terms of diversification.
7.26.192	These flowers grow in a botanical garden border in Bellevue, WA.
7.26.193	Flowering plants dominate terrestrial landscapes.
7.26.194	The vivid colors of flowers are an adaptation to pollination by animals such as insects and birds.
7.26.195	The success of angiosperms is due to two novel reproductive structures: flowers and fruit.
7.26.196	The function of the flower is to ensure pollination.
7.26.197	Flowers also provide protection for the ovule and developing embryo inside a receptacle.
7.26.198	The function of the fruit is seed dispersal.
7.26.199	They also protect the developing seed.
7.26.200	Different fruit structures or tissues on fruit—such as sweet flesh, wings, parachutes, or spines that grab—reflect the dispersal strategies that help spread seeds.
7.26.201	Flowers Flowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central stalk.
7.26.202	Although they vary greatly in appearance, all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens.
7.26.203	The peduncle attaches the flower to the plant.
7.26.204	A whorl of sepals (collectively called the calyx) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud.
7.26.205	Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions.
7.26.206	For example, the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical.
7.26.207	Petals, collectively the corolla, are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators.
7.26.208	Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous.
7.26.209	Sepals and petals together form the perianth.
7.26.210	The sexual organs (carpels and stamens) are located at the center of the flower.
7.26.211	As illustrated in Figure 26.14, styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel.
7.26.212	Flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused.
7.26.213	Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil.
7.26.214	The megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel.
7.26.215	A long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel.
7.26.216	The ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization.
7.26.217	The male reproductive organs, the stamens (collectively called the androecium), surround the central carpel.
7.26.218	Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac-like structure called the anther.
7.26.219	The filament supports the anther, where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains.
7.26.220	This image depicts the structure of a perfect flower.
7.26.221	Perfect flowers produce both male and female floral organs.
7.26.222	The flower shown has only one carpel, but some flowers have a cluster of carpels.
7.26.223	Together, all the carpels make up the gynoecium.
7.26.224	Fruit
7.26.225	As the seed develops, the walls of the ovary thicken and form the fruit.
7.26.226	The seed forms in an ovary, which also enlarges as the seeds grow.
7.26.227	In botany, a fertilized and fully grown, ripened ovary is a fruit.
7.26.228	Many foods commonly called vegetables are actually fruit.
7.26.229	Eggplants, zucchini, string beans, and bell peppers are all technically fruit because they contain seeds and are derived from the thick ovary tissue.
7.26.230	Acorns are nuts, and winged maple whirligigs (whose botanical name is samara) are also fruit.
7.26.231	Botanists classify fruit into more than two dozen different categories, only a few of which are actually fleshy and sweet.
7.26.232	Mature fruit can be fleshy or dry.
7.26.233	Fleshy fruit include the familiar berries, peaches, apples, grapes, and tomatoes.
7.26.234	Rice, wheat, and nuts are examples of dry fruit.
7.26.235	Another distinction is that not all fruits are derived from the ovary.
7.26.236	For instance, strawberries are derived from the receptacle and apples from the pericarp, or hypanthium.
7.26.237	Some fruits are derived from separate ovaries in a single flower, such as the raspberry.
7.26.238	Other fruits, such as the pineapple, form from clusters of flowers.
7.26.239	Additionally, some fruits, like watermelon and orange, have rinds.
7.26.240	Regardless of how they are formed, fruits are an agent of seed dispersal.
7.26.241	The variety of shapes and characteristics reflect the mode of dispersal.
7.26.242	Wind carries the light dry fruit of trees and dandelions.
7.26.243	Water transports floating coconuts.
7.26.244	Some fruits attract herbivores with color or perfume, or as food.
7.26.245	Once eaten, tough, undigested seeds are dispersed through the herbivore’s feces.
7.26.246	Other fruits have burs and hooks to cling to fur and hitch rides on animals.
7.26.247	The Life Cycle of an Angiosperm
7.26.248	The adult, or sporophyte, phase is the main phase of an angiosperm’s life cycle (Figure 26.15).
7.26.249	Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are heterosporous.
7.26.250	Therefore, they generate microspores, which will generate pollen grains as the male gametophytes, and megaspores, which will form an ovule that contains female gametophytes.
7.26.251	Inside the anthers’ microsporangia, male gametophytes divide by meiosis to generate haploid microspores, which, in turn, undergo mitosis and give rise to pollen grains.
7.26.252	Each pollen grain contains two cells: one generative cell that will divide into two sperm and a second cell that will become the pollen tube cell.
7.26.253	The ovule, sheltered within the ovary of the carpel, contains the megasporangium protected by two layers of integuments and the ovary wall.
7.26.254	Within each megasporangium, a megasporocyte undergoes meiosis, generating four megaspores—three small and one large.
7.26.255	Only the large megaspore survives; it produces the female gametophyte, referred to as the embryo sac.
7.26.256	The megaspore divides three times to form an eight-cell stage.
7.26.257	Four of these cells migrate to each pole of the embryo sac; two come to the equator, and will eventually fuse to form a 2n polar nucleus; the three cells away from the egg form antipodals, and the two cells closest to the egg become the synergids.
7.26.258	The mature embryo sac contains one egg cell, two synergids or “helper” cells, three antipodal cells, and two polar nuclei in a central cell.
7.26.259	When a pollen grain reaches the stigma, a pollen tube extends from the grain, grows down the style, and enters through the micropyle: an opening in the integuments of the ovule.
7.26.260	The two sperm cells are deposited in the embryo sac.
7.26.261	A double fertilization event then occurs.
7.26.262	One sperm and the egg combine, forming a diploid zygote—the future embryo.
7.26.263	The other sperm fuses with the 2n polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm, which is tissue that serves as a food reserve.
7.26.264	The zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle, or small root, and one (monocot) or two (dicot) leaf-like organs called cotyledons.
7.26.265	This difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms: the monocots and the eudicots.
7.26.266	Seed food reserves are stored outside the embryo, in the form of complex carbohydrates, lipids or proteins.
7.26.267	The cotyledons serve as conduits to transmit the broken-down food reserves from their storage site inside the seed to the developing embryo.
7.26.268	The seed consists of a toughened layer of integuments forming the coat, the endosperm with food reserves, and at the center, the well-protected embryo.
7.26.269	Most flowers are monoecious or bisexual, which means that they carry both stamens and carpels; only a few species selfpollinate.
7.26.270	Monoecious flowers are also known as “perfect” flowers because they contain both types of sex organs (Figure 26.14).
7.26.271	Both anatomical and environmental barriers promote cross-pollination mediated by a physical agent (wind or water), or an animal, such as an insect or bird.
7.26.272	Cross-pollination increases genetic diversity in a species.
7.26.273	Diversity of Angiosperms Angiosperms are classified in a single phylum: the Anthophyta.
7.26.274	Modern angiosperms appear to be a monophyletic group, which means that they originate from a single ancestor.
7.26.275	Flowering plants are divided into two major groups, according to the structure of the cotyledons, pollen grains, and other structures.
7.26.276	Monocots include grasses and lilies, and eudicots or dicots form a polyphyletic group.
7.26.277	Basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation into monocots and eudicots because they exhibit traits from both groups.
7.26.278	They are categorized separately in many classification schemes.
7.26.279	The Magnoliidae (magnolia trees, laurels, and water lilies) and the Piperaceae (peppers) belong to the basal angiosperm group.
7.26.280	Basal Angiosperms
7.26.281	The Magnoliidae are represented by the magnolias: tall trees bearing large, fragrant flowers that have many parts and are considered archaic (Figure 26.16d).
7.26.282	Laurel trees produce fragrant leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers.
7.26.283	The Laurales grow mostly in warmer climates and are small trees and shrubs.
7.26.284	Familiar plants in this group include the bay laurel, cinnamon, spice bush (Figure 26.16a), and avocado tree.
7.26.285	The Nymphaeales are comprised of the water lilies, lotus (Figure 26.16c), and similar plants; all species thrive in freshwater biomes, and have leaves that float on the water surface or grow underwater.
7.26.286	Water lilies are particularly prized by gardeners, and have graced ponds and pools for thousands of years.
7.26.287	The Piperales are a group of herbs, shrubs, and small trees that grow in the tropical climates.
7.26.288	They have small flowers without petals that are tightly arranged in long spikes.
7.26.289	Many species are the source of prized fragrance or spices, for example the berries of Piper nigrum (Figure 26.16b) are the familiar black peppercorns that are used to flavor many dishes.
7.26.290	The (a) common spicebush belongs to the Laurales, the same family as cinnamon and bay laurel.
7.26.291	The fruit of (b) the Piper nigrum plant is black pepper, the main product that was traded along spice routes.
7.26.292	Notice the small, unobtrusive, clustered flowers.
7.26.293	(c) Lotus flowers, Nelumbo nucifera, have been cultivated since ancient times for their ornamental value; the root of the lotus flower is eaten as a vegetable.
7.26.294	The red seeds of (d) a magnolia tree, characteristic of the final stage, are just starting to appear.
7.26.295	Monocots Plants in the monocot group are primarily identified as such by the presence of a single cotyledon in the seedling.
7.26.296	Other anatomical features shared by monocots include veins that run parallel to the length of the leaves, and flower parts that are arranged in a three- or six-fold symmetry.
7.26.297	True woody tissue is rarely found in monocots.
7.26.298	In palm trees, vascular and parenchyma tissues produced by the primary and secondary thickening meristems form the trunk.
7.26.299	The pollen from the first angiosperms was monosulcate, containing a single furrow or pore through the outer layer.
7.26.300	This feature is still seen in the modern monocots.
7.26.301	Vascular tissue of the stem is not arranged in any particular pattern.
7.26.302	The root system is mostly adventitious and unusually positioned, with no major tap root.
7.26.303	The monocots include familiar plants such as the true lilies (which are at the origin of their alternate name of Liliopsida), orchids, grasses, and palms.
7.26.304	Many important crops are monocots, such as rice and other cereals, corn, sugar cane, and tropical fruits like bananas and pineapples.
7.26.305	The world’s major crops are flowering plants.
7.26.306	(a) Rice, (b) wheat, and (c) bananas are monocots, while (d) cabbage, (e) beans, and (f) peaches are dicots.
7.26.307	Eudicots Eudicots, or true dicots, are characterized by the presence of two cotyledons in the developing shoot.
7.26.308	Veins form a network in leaves, and flower parts come in four, five, or many whorls.
7.26.309	Vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem; in monocots, vascular tissue is scattered in the stem.
7.26.310	Eudicots can be herbaceous (like grasses), or produce woody tissues.
7.26.311	Most eudicots produce pollen that is trisulcate or triporate, with three furrows or pores.
7.26.312	The root system is usually anchored by one main root developed from the embryonic radicle.
7.26.313	Eudicots comprise two-thirds of all flowering plants.
7.26.314	The major differences between monocots and eudicots are summarized in Table 26.1.
7.26.315	Many species exhibit characteristics that belong to either group; as such, the classification of a plant as a monocot or a eudicot is not always clearly evident.
7.26.316	Without seed plants, life as we know it would not be possible.
7.26.317	Plants play a key role in the maintenance of terrestrial ecosystems through stabilization of soils, cycling of carbon, and climate moderation.
7.26.318	Large tropical forests release oxygen and act as carbon dioxide sinks.
7.26.319	Seed plants provide shelter to many life forms, as well as food for herbivores, thereby indirectly feeding carnivores.
7.26.320	Plant secondary metabolites are used for medicinal purposes and industrial production.
7.26.321	Animals and Plants: Herbivory Coevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support, especially because both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic.
7.26.322	Many authors have attributed the diversity of plants and insects to pollination and herbivory, or consumption of plants by insects and other animals.
7.26.323	This is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination.
7.26.324	Coevolution of herbivores and plant defenses is observed in nature.
7.26.325	Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals.
7.26.326	A sort of arms race exists between plants and herbivores.
7.26.327	To “combat” herbivores, some plant seeds—such as acorn and unripened persimmon—are high in alkaloids and therefore unsavory to some animals.
7.26.328	Other plants are protected by bark, although some animals developed specialized mouth pieces to tear and chew vegetal material.
7.26.329	Spines and thorns (Figure 26.18) deter most animals, except for mammals with thick fur, and some birds have specialized beaks to get past such defenses.
7.26.330	Spines and (b) thorns are examples of plant defenses.
7.26.331	Herbivory has been used by seed plants for their own benefit in a display of mutualistic relationships.
7.26.332	The dispersal of fruit by animals is the most striking example.
7.26.333	The plant offers to the herbivore a nutritious source of food in return for spreading the plant’s genetic material to a wider area.
7.26.334	An extreme example of collaboration between an animal and a plant is the case of acacia trees and ants.
7.26.335	The trees support the insects with shelter and food.
7.26.336	In return, ants discourage herbivores, both invertebrates and vertebrates, by stinging and attacking leaf-eating insects.
7.26.337	Animals and Plants:
7.26.338	Pollination Grasses are a successful group of flowering plants that are wind pollinated.
7.26.339	They produce large amounts of powdery pollen carried over large distances by the wind.
7.26.340	The flowers are small and wisp-like.
7.26.341	Large trees such as oaks, maples, and birches are also wind pollinated.
7.26.342	More than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination: the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma.
7.26.343	Consequently, plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators.
7.26.344	The specificity of specialized plant structures that target animals can be very surprising.
7.26.345	It is possible, for example, to determine the type of pollinator favored by a plant just from the flower’s characteristics.
7.26.346	Many bird or insect-pollinated flowers secrete nectar, which is a sugary liquid.
7.26.347	They also produce both fertile pollen, for reproduction, and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects.
7.26.348	Butterflies and bees can detect ultraviolet light.
7.26.349	Flowers that attract these pollinators usually display a pattern of low ultraviolet reflectance that helps them quickly locate the flower's center and collect nectar while being dusted with pollen (Figure 26.19).
7.26.350	Large, red flowers with little smell and a long funnel shape are preferred by hummingbirds, who have good color perception, a poor sense of smell, and need a strong perch.
7.26.351	White flowers opened at night attract moths.
7.26.352	Other animals—such as bats, lemurs, and lizards—can also act as pollinating agents.
7.26.353	Any disruption to these interactions, such as the disappearance of bees as a consequence of colony collapse disorders, can lead to disaster for agricultural industries that depend heavily on pollinated crops.
7.26.354	As a bee collects nectar from a flower, it is dusted by pollen, which it then disperses to other flowers.
7.26.355	The Importance of Seed Plants in Human Life Seed plants are the foundation of human diets across the world (Figure 26.20).
7.26.356	Many societies eat almost exclusively vegetarian fare and depend solely on seed plants for their nutritional needs.
7.26.357	A few crops (rice, wheat, and potatoes) dominate the agricultural landscape.
7.26.358	Many crops were developed during the agricultural revolution, when human societies made the transition from nomadic hunter–gatherers to horticulture and agriculture.
7.26.359	Cereals, rich in carbohydrates, provide the staple of many human diets.
7.26.360	Beans and nuts supply proteins.
7.26.361	Fats are derived from crushed seeds, as is the case for peanut and rapeseed (canola) oils, or fruits such as olives.
7.26.362	Animal husbandry also consumes large amounts of crops.
7.26.363	Staple crops are not the only food derived from seed plants.
7.26.364	Fruits and vegetables provide nutrients, vitamins, and fiber.
7.26.365	Sugar, to sweeten dishes, is produced from the monocot sugarcane and the eudicot sugar beet.
7.26.366	Drinks are made from infusions of tea leaves, chamomile flowers, crushed coffee beans, or powdered cocoa beans.
7.26.367	Spices come from many different plant parts:
7.26.368	saffron and cloves are stamens and buds, black pepper and vanilla are seeds, the bark of a bush in the Laurales family supplies cinnamon, and the herbs that flavor many dishes come from dried leaves and fruit, such as the pungent red chili pepper.
7.26.369	The volatile oils of flowers and bark provide the scent of perfumes.
7.26.370	Additionally, no discussion of seed plant contribution to human diet would be complete without the mention of alcohol.
7.26.371	Fermentation of plant-derived sugars and starches is used to produce alcoholic beverages in all societies.
7.26.372	In some cases, the beverages are derived from the fermentation of sugars from fruit, as with wines and, in other cases, from the fermentation of carbohydrates derived from seeds, as with beers.
7.26.373	Seed plants have many other uses, including providing wood as a source of timber for construction, fuel, and material to build furniture.
7.26.374	Most paper is derived from the pulp of coniferous trees.
7.26.375	Fibers of seed plants such as cotton, flax, and hemp are woven into cloth.
7.26.376	Textile dyes, such as indigo, were mostly of plant origin until the advent of synthetic chemical dyes.
7.26.377	Lastly, it is more difficult to quantify the benefits of ornamental seed plants.
7.26.378	These grace private and public spaces, adding beauty and serenity to human lives and inspiring painters and poets alike.
7.26.379	Humans rely on plants for a variety of reasons.
7.26.380	(a) Cacao beans were introduced in Europe from the New World, where they were used by Mesoamerican civilizations.
7.26.381	Combined with sugar, another plant product, chocolate is a popular food.
7.26.382	(b) Flowers like the tulip are cultivated for their beauty.
7.26.383	(c) Quinine, extracted from cinchona trees, is used to treat malaria, to reduce fever, and to alleviate pain.
7.26.384	(d)
7.26.385	This violin is made of wood.
7.26.386	The medicinal properties of plants have been known to human societies since ancient times.
7.26.387	There are references to the use of plants’ curative properties in Egyptian, Babylonian, and Chinese writings from 5,000 years ago.
7.26.388	Many modern synthetic therapeutic drugs are derived or synthesized de novo from plant secondary metabolites.
7.26.389	It is important to note that the same plant extract can be a therapeutic remedy at low concentrations, become an addictive drug at higher doses, and can potentially kill at high concentrations.
7.26.390	Table 26.3 presents a few drugs, their plants of origin, and their medicinal applications.
7.26.391	Biodiversity of Plants Biodiversity ensures a resource for new food crops and medicines.
7.26.392	Plant life balances ecosystems, protects watersheds, mitigates erosion, moderates climate and provides shelter for many animal species.
7.26.393	Threats to plant diversity, however, come from many angles.
7.26.394	The explosion of the human population, especially in tropical countries where birth rates are highest and economic development is in full swing, is leading to human encroachment into forested areas.
7.26.395	To feed the larger population, humans need to obtain arable land, so there is massive clearing of trees.
7.26.396	The need for more energy to power larger cities and economic growth therein leads to the construction of dams, the consequent flooding of ecosystems, and increased emissions of pollutants.
7.26.397	Other threats to tropical forests come from poachers, who log trees for their precious wood.
7.26.398	Ebony and Brazilian rosewood, both on the endangered list, are examples of tree species driven almost to extinction by indiscriminate logging.
7.26.399	The number of plant species becoming extinct is increasing at an alarming rate.
7.26.400	Because ecosystems are in a delicate balance, and seed plants maintain close symbiotic relationships with animals—
7.26.401	whether predators or pollinators—the disappearance of a single plant can lead to the extinction of connected animal species.
7.26.402	A real and pressing issue is that many plant species have not yet been catalogued, and so their place in the ecosystem is unknown.
7.26.403	These unknown species are threatened by logging, habitat destruction, and loss of pollinators.
7.26.404	They may become extinct before we have the chance to begin to understand the possible impacts from their disappearance.
7.26.405	Efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action, from preserving heirloom seeds to barcoding species.
7.26.406	Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations, as opposed to the seeds used for large-scale agricultural production.
7.26.407	Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences, taken from a well-characterized portion of the genome, are used to identify a species through DNA analysis.
7.27.0	The leaf chameleon (Brookesia micra) was discovered in northern Madagascar in 2012.
7.27.1	At just over one inch long, it is the smallest known chameleon.
7.27.2	Animal evolution began in the ocean over 600 million years ago with tiny creatures that probably do not resemble any living organism today.
7.27.3	Since then, animals have evolved into a highly diverse kingdom.
7.27.4	Although over one million extant (currently living) species of animals have been identified, scientists are continually discovering more species as they explore ecosystems around the world.
7.27.5	The number of extant species is estimated to be between 3 and 30 million.
7.27.6	But what is an animal?
7.27.7	While we can easily identify dogs, birds, fish, spiders, and worms as animals, other organisms, such as corals and sponges, are not as easy to classify.
7.27.8	Animals vary in complexity—from sea sponges to crickets to chimpanzees—and scientists are faced with the difficult task of classifying them within a unified system.
7.27.9	They must identify traits that are common to all animals as well as traits that can be used to distinguish among related groups of animals.
7.27.10	The animal classification system characterizes animals based on their anatomy, morphology, evolutionary history, features of embryological development, and genetic makeup.
7.27.11	This classification scheme is constantly developing as new information about species arises.
7.27.12	Understanding and classifying the great variety of living species help us better understand how to conserve the diversity of life on earth.
7.27.13	Even though members of the animal kingdom are incredibly diverse, most animals share certain features that distinguish them from organisms in other kingdoms.
7.27.14	All animals are eukaryotic, multicellular organisms, and almost all animals have a complex tissue structure with differentiated and specialized tissues.
7.27.15	Most animals are motile, at least during certain life stages.
7.27.16	All animals require a source of food and are therefore heterotrophic, ingesting other living or dead organisms; this feature distinguishes them from autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, which synthesize their own nutrients through photosynthesis.
7.27.17	As heterotrophs, animals may be carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, or parasites (Figure 27.2ab).
7.27.18	Most animals reproduce sexually, and the offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan.
7.27.19	The body plan refers to the morphology of an animal, determined by developmental cues.
7.27.20	All animals are heterotrophs that derive energy from food.
7.27.21	The (a) black bear is an omnivore, eating both plants and animals.
7.27.22	The (b) heartworm
7.27.23	Dirofilaria immitis is a parasite that derives energy from its hosts.
7.27.24	It spends its larval stage in mosquitoes and its adult stage infesting the heart of dogs and other mammals, as shown here.
7.27.25	Complex Tissue Structure
7.27.26	As multicellular organisms, animals differ from plants and fungi because their cells don’t have cell walls, their cells may be embedded in an extracellular matrix (such as bone, skin, or connective tissue), and their cells have unique structures for intercellular communication (such as gap junctions).
7.27.27	In addition, animals possess unique tissues, absent in fungi and plants, which allow coordination (nerve tissue) of motility (muscle tissue).
7.27.28	Animals are also characterized by specialized connective tissues that provide structural support for cells and organs.
7.27.29	This connective tissue constitutes the extracellular surroundings of cells and is made up of organic and inorganic materials.
7.27.30	In vertebrates, bone tissue is a type of connective tissue that supports the entire body structure.
7.27.31	The complex bodies and activities of vertebrates demand such supportive tissues.
7.27.32	Epithelial tissues cover, line, protect, and secrete.
7.27.33	Epithelial tissues include the epidermis of the integument, the lining of the digestive tract and trachea, and make up the ducts of the liver and glands of advanced animals.
7.27.34	The animal kingdom is divided into Parazoa (sponges) and Eumetazoa (all other animals).
7.27.35	As very simple animals, the organisms in group Parazoa (“beside animal”) do not contain true specialized tissues; although they do possess specialized cells that perform different functions, those cells are not organized into tissues.
7.27.36	These organisms are considered animals since they lack the ability to make their own food.
7.27.37	Animals with true tissues are in the group Eumetazoa (“true animals”).
7.27.38	When we think of animals, we usually think of Eumetazoans, since most animals fall into this category.
7.27.39	The different types of tissues in true animals are responsible for carrying out specific functions for the organism.
7.27.40	This differentiation and specialization of tissues is part of what allows for such incredible animal diversity.
7.27.41	For example, the evolution of nerve tissues and muscle tissues has resulted in animals’ unique ability to rapidly sense and respond to changes in their environment.
7.27.42	This allows animals to survive in environments where they must compete with other species to meet their nutritional demands.
7.27.43	Animal Reproduction and Development
7.27.44	Most animals are diploid organisms, meaning that their body (somatic) cells are diploid and haploid reproductive (gamete) cells are produced through meiosis.
7.27.45	Some exceptions exist: For example, in bees, wasps, and ants, the male is haploid because it develops from unfertilized eggs.
7.27.46	Most animals undergo sexual reproduction: This fact distinguishes animals from fungi, protists, and bacteria, where asexual reproduction is common or exclusive.
7.27.47	However, a few groups, such as cnidarians, flatworm, and roundworms, undergo asexual reproduction, although nearly all of those animals also have a sexual phase to their life cycle.
7.27.48	Processes of Animal Reproduction and Embryonic Development During sexual reproduction, the haploid gametes of the male and female individuals of a species combine in a process called fertilization.
7.27.49	Typically, the small, motile male sperm fertilizes the much larger, sessile female egg.
7.27.50	This process produces a diploid fertilized egg called a zygote.
7.27.51	Some animal species—including sea stars and sea anemones, as well as some insects, reptiles, and fish—are capable of asexual reproduction.
7.27.52	The most common forms of asexual reproduction for stationary aquatic animals include budding and fragmentation, where part of a parent individual can separate and grow into a new individual.
7.27.53	In contrast, a form of asexual reproduction found in certain insects and vertebrates is called parthenogenesis (or “virgin beginning”), where unfertilized eggs can develop into new male offspring.
7.27.54	This type of parthenogenesis is called haplodiploidy.
7.27.55	These types of asexual reproduction produce genetically identical offspring, which is disadvantageous from the perspective of evolutionary adaptability because of the potential buildup of deleterious mutations.
7.27.56	However, for animals that are limited in their capacity to attract mates, asexual reproduction can ensure genetic propagation.
7.27.57	After fertilization, a series of developmental stages occur during which primary germ layers are established and reorganize to form an embryo.
7.27.58	During this process, animal tissues begin to specialize and organize into organs and organ systems, determining their future morphology and physiology.
7.27.59	Some animals, such as grasshoppers, undergo incomplete metamorphosis, in which the young resemble the adult.
7.27.60	Other animals, such as some insects, undergo complete metamorphosis where individuals enter one or more larval stages that may in differ in structure and function from the adult (Figure 27.3).
7.27.61	For the latter, the young and the adult may have different diets, limiting competition for food between them.
7.27.62	Regardless of whether a species undergoes complete or incomplete metamorphosis, the series of developmental stages of the embryo remains largely the same for most members of the animal kingdom.
7.27.63	The grasshopper undergoes incomplete metamorphosis.
7.27.64	(b)
7.27.65	The butterfly undergoes complete metamorphosis.
7.27.66	The process of animal development begins with the cleavage, or series of mitotic cell divisions, of the zygote (Figure 27.4).
7.27.67	Three cell divisions transform the single-celled zygote into an eight-celled structure.
7.27.68	After further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells, a 6–32-celled hollow structure called a blastula is formed.
7.27.69	Next, the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation.
7.27.70	This leads to the formation of the next developmental stage, the gastrula, in which the future digestive cavity is formed.
7.27.71	Different cell layers (called germ layers) are formed during gastrulation.
7.27.72	These germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types, organs, and organ systems during a process called organogenesis.
7.27.73	During embryonic development, the zygote undergoes a series of mitotic cell divisions, or cleavages, to form an eight-cell stage, then a hollow blastula.
7.27.74	During a process called gastrulation, the blastula folds inward to form a cavity in the gastrula.
7.27.75	The Role of Homeobox (Hox) Genes in Animal Development Since the early 19th century, scientists have observed that many animals, from the very simple to the complex, shared similar embryonic morphology and development.
7.27.76	Surprisingly, a human embryo and a frog embryo, at a certain stage of embryonic development, look remarkably alike.
7.27.77	For a long time, scientists did not understand why so many animal species looked similar during embryonic development but were very different as adults.
7.27.78	They wondered what dictated the developmental direction that a fly, mouse, frog, or human embryo would take.
7.27.79	Near the end of the 20th century, a particular class of genes was discovered that had this very job.
7.27.80	These genes that determine animal structure are called “homeotic genes,” and they contain DNA sequences called homeoboxes.
7.27.81	The animal genes containing homeobox sequences are specifically referred to as Hox genes.
7.27.82	This family of genes is responsible for determining the general body plan, such as the number of body segments of an animal, the number and placement of appendages, and animal head-tail directionality.
7.27.83	The first Hox genes to be sequenced were those from the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster).
7.27.84	A single Hox mutation in the fruit fly can result in an extra pair of wings or even appendages growing from the “wrong” body part.
7.27.85	While there are a great many genes that play roles in the morphological development of an animal, what makes Hox genes so powerful is that they serve as master control genes that can turn on or off large numbers of other genes.
7.27.86	Hox genes do this by coding transcription factors that control the expression of numerous other genes.
7.27.87	Hox genes are homologous in the animal kingdom, that is, the genetic sequences of Hox genes and their positions on chromosomes are remarkably similar across most animals because of their presence in a common ancestor, from worms to flies, mice, and humans (Figure 27.5).
7.27.88	One of the contributions to increased animal body complexity is that Hox genes have undergone at least two duplication events during animal evolution, with the additional genes allowing for more complex body types to evolve.
7.27.89	Scientists have developed a classification scheme that categorizes all members of the animal kingdom, although there are exceptions to most “rules” governing animal classification (Figure 27.6).
7.27.90	Animals are primarily classified according to morphological and developmental characteristics, such as a body plan.
7.27.91	One of the most prominent features of the body plan of true animals is that they are morphologically symmetrical.
7.27.92	This means that their distribution of body parts is balanced along an axis.
7.27.93	Additional characteristics include the number of tissue layers formed during development, the presence or absence of an internal body cavity, and other features of embryological development, such as the origin of the mouth and anus.
7.27.94	Animal Characterization Based on Body Symmetry
7.27.95	At a very basic level of classification, true animals can be largely divided into three groups based on the type of symmetry of their body plan: radially symmetrical, bilaterally symmetrical, and asymmetrical.
7.27.96	Asymmetry is a unique feature of Parazoa (Figure 27.7a).
7.27.97	Only a few animal groups display radial symmetry.
7.27.98	All types of symmetry are well suited to meet the unique demands of a particular animal’s lifestyle.
7.27.99	Radial symmetry is the arrangement of body parts around a central axis, as is seen in a drinking glass or pie.
7.27.100	It results in animals having top and bottom surfaces but no left and right sides, or front or back.
7.27.101	The two halves of a radially symmetrical animal may be described as the side with a mouth or “oral side,” and the side without a mouth (the “aboral side”).
7.27.102	This form of symmetry marks the body plans of animals in the phyla Ctenophora and Cnidaria, including jellyfish and adult sea anemones (Figure 27.7bc).
7.27.103	Radial symmetry equips these sea creatures (which may be sedentary or only capable of slow movement or floating) to experience the environment equally from all directions.
7.27.104	The (a) sponge is asymmetrical.
7.27.105	The (b) jellyfish and (c) anemone are radially symmetrical, and the (d) butterfly is bilaterally symmetrical.
7.27.106	Bilateral symmetry involves the division of the animal through a sagittal plane, resulting in two mirror image, right and left halves, such as those of a butterfly (Figure 27.7d), crab, or human body.
7.27.107	Animals with bilateral symmetry have a “head” and “tail”
7.27.108	(anterior vs. posterior), front and back
7.27.109	(dorsal vs. ventral), and right and left sides (Figure 27.8).
7.27.110	All true animals except those with radial symmetry are bilaterally symmetrical.
7.27.111	The evolution of bilateral symmetry that allowed for the formation of anterior and posterior (head and tail) ends promoted a phenomenon called cephalization, which refers to the collection of an organized nervous system at the animal’s anterior end.
7.27.112	In contrast to radial symmetry, which is best suited for stationary or limited-motion lifestyles, bilateral symmetry allows for streamlined and directional motion.
7.27.113	In evolutionary terms, this simple form of symmetry promoted active mobility and increased sophistication of resource-seeking and predator-prey relationships.
7.27.114	The bilaterally symmetrical human body can be divided into planes.
7.27.115	Animals in the phylum Echinodermata (such as sea stars, sand dollars, and sea urchins) display radial symmetry as adults, but their larval stages exhibit bilateral symmetry.
7.27.116	This is termed secondary radial symmetry.
7.27.117	They are believed to have evolved from bilaterally symmetrical animals; thus, they are classified as bilaterally symmetrical.
7.27.118	Animal Characterization Based on Features of Embryological Development
7.27.119	Most animal species undergo a separation of tissues into germ layers during embryonic development.
7.27.120	Recall that these germ layers are formed during gastrulation, and that they are predetermined to develop into the animal’s specialized tissues and organs.
7.27.121	Animals develop either two or three embryonic germs layers (Figure 27.9).
7.27.122	The animals that display radial symmetry develop two germ layers, an inner layer (endoderm) and an outer layer (ectoderm).
7.27.123	These animals are called diploblasts.
7.27.124	Diploblasts have a non-living layer between the endoderm and ectoderm.
7.27.125	More complex animals (those with bilateral symmetry) develop three tissue layers: an inner layer (endoderm), an outer layer (ectoderm), and a middle layer (mesoderm).
7.27.126	Animals with three tissue layers are called triploblasts.
7.27.127	Each of the three germ layers is programmed to give rise to particular body tissues and organs.
7.27.128	The endoderm gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract (including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas), as well as to the lining of the trachea, bronchi, and lungs of the respiratory tract, along with a few other structures.
7.27.129	The ectoderm develops into the outer epithelial covering of the body surface, the central nervous system, and a few other structures.
7.27.130	The mesoderm is the third germ layer; it forms between the endoderm and ectoderm in triploblasts.
7.27.131	This germ layer gives rise to all muscle tissues (including the cardiac tissues and muscles of the intestines), connective tissues such as the skeleton and blood cells, and most other visceral organs such as the kidneys and the spleen.
7.27.132	Presence or Absence of a Coelom Further subdivision of animals with three germ layers (triploblasts) results in the separation of animals that may develop an internal body cavity derived from mesoderm, called a coelom, and those that do not.
7.27.133	This epithelial cell-lined coelomic cavity represents a space, usually filled with fluid, which lies between the visceral organs and the body wall.
7.27.134	It houses many organs such as the digestive system, kidneys, reproductive organs, and heart, and contains the circulatory system.
7.27.135	In some animals, such as mammals, the part of the coelom called the pleural cavity provides space for the lungs to expand during breathing.
7.27.136	The evolution of the coelom is associated with many functional advantages.
7.27.137	Primarily, the coelom provides cushioning and shock absorption for the major organ systems.
7.27.138	Organs housed within the coelom can grow and move freely, which promotes optimal organ development and placement.
7.27.139	The coelom also provides space for the diffusion of gases and nutrients, as well as body flexibility, promoting improved animal motility.
7.27.140	Triploblasts that do not develop a coelom are called acoelomates, and their mesoderm region is completely filled with tissue, although they do still have a gut cavity.
7.27.141	Examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum Platyhelminthes, also known as flatworms.
7.27.142	Animals with a true coelom are called eucoelomates (or coelomates)
7.27.143	(Figure 27.10).
7.27.144	A true coelom arises entirely within the mesoderm germ layer and is lined by an epithelial membrane.
7.27.145	This membrane also lines the organs within the coelom, connecting and holding them in position while allowing them some free motion.
7.27.146	Annelids, mollusks, arthropods, echinoderms, and chordates are all eucoelomates.
7.27.147	A third group of triploblasts has a slightly different coelom derived partly from mesoderm and partly from endoderm, which is found between the two layers.
7.27.148	Although still functional, these are considered false coeloms, and those animals are called pseudocoelomates.
7.27.149	The phylum Nematoda (roundworms) is an example of a pseudocoelomate.
7.27.150	True coelomates can be further characterized based on certain features of their early embryological development.
7.27.151	Triploblasts may be (a) acoelomates, (b) eucoelomates, or (c) pseudocoelomates.
7.27.152	Acoelomates have no body cavity.
7.27.153	Eucoelomates have a body cavity within the mesoderm, called a coelom, which is lined with mesoderm.
7.27.154	Pseudocoelomates also have a body cavity, but it is sandwiched between the endoderm and mesoderm.
7.27.155	Embryonic Development of the Mouth Bilaterally symmetrical, tribloblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in their early embryonic development.
7.27.156	Protostomes include arthropods, mollusks, and annelids.
7.27.157	Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms.
7.27.158	These two groups are separated based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first: mouth or anus.
7.27.159	The word protostome comes from the Greek word meaning “mouth first,” and deuterostome originates from the word meaning “mouth second” (in this case, the anus develops first).
7.27.160	The mouth or anus develops from a structure called the blastopore (Figure 27.11).
7.27.161	The blastopore is the indentation formed during the initial stages of gastrulation.
7.27.162	In later stages, a second opening forms, and these two openings will eventually give rise to the mouth and anus (Figure 27.11).
7.27.163	It has long been believed that the blastopore develops into the mouth of protostomes, with the second opening developing into the anus; the opposite is true for deuterostomes.
7.27.164	Recent evidence has challenged this view of the development of the blastopore of protostomes, however, and the theory remains under debate.
7.27.165	Another distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation, beginning from the gastrula stage.
7.27.166	The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely, meaning that during development, a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom.
7.27.167	Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely.
7.27.168	Here, the mesoderm develops as pouches that are pinched off from the endoderm tissue.
7.27.169	These pouches eventually fuse to form the mesoderm, which then gives rise to the coelom.
7.27.170	The earliest distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the type of cleavage undergone by the zygote.
7.27.171	Protostomes undergo spiral cleavage, meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated, and thus misaligned, with respect to the cells of the opposite pole.
7.27.172	This is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage.
7.27.173	Deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage, where the cleavage axes are either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis, resulting in the alignment of the cells between the two poles.
7.27.174	Eucoelomates can be divided into two groups based on their early embryonic development.
7.27.175	In protostomes, part of the mesoderm separates to form the coelom in a process called schizocoely.
7.27.176	In deuterostomes, the mesoderm pinches off to form the coelom in a process called enterocoely.
7.27.177	It was long believed that the blastopore developed into the mouth in protostomes and into the anus in deuterostomes, but recent evidence challenges this belief.
7.27.178	There is a second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes.
7.27.179	In addition to spiral cleavage, protostomes also undergo determinate cleavage.
7.27.180	This means that even at this early stage, the developmental fate of each embryonic cell is already determined.
7.27.181	A cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type.
7.27.182	In contrast, deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage, in which cells are not yet pre-determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types.
7.27.183	These cells are referred to as undifferentiated cells.
7.27.184	This characteristic of deuterostomes is reflected in the existence of familiar embryonic stem cells, which have the ability to develop into any cell type until their fate is programmed at a later developmental stage.
7.27.185	Biologists strive to understand the evolutionary history and relationships of members of the animal kingdom, and all of life, for that matter.
7.27.186	The study of phylogeny aims to determine the evolutionary relationships between phyla.
7.27.187	Currently, most biologists divide the animal kingdom into 35 to 40 phyla.
7.27.188	Scientists develop phylogenetic trees, which serve as hypotheses about which species have evolved from which ancestors Recall that until recently, only morphological characteristics and the fossil record were used to determine phylogenetic relationships among animals.
7.27.189	Scientific understanding of the distinctions and hierarchies between anatomical characteristics provided much of this knowledge.
7.27.190	Used alone, however, this information can be misleading.
7.27.191	Morphological characteristics may evolve multiple times, and independently, through evolutionary history.
7.27.192	Analogous characteristics may appear similar between animals, but their underlying evolution may be very different.
7.27.193	With the advancement of molecular technologies, modern phylogenetics is now informed by genetic and molecular analyses, in addition to traditional morphological and fossil data.
7.27.194	With a growing understanding of genetics, the animal evolutionary tree has changed substantially and continues to change as new DNA and RNA analyses are performed on additional animal species.
7.27.195	Constructing an Animal Phylogenetic Tree
7.27.196	The current understanding of evolutionary relationships between animal, or Metazoa, phyla begins with the distinction between “true” animals with true differentiated tissues, called Eumetazoa, and animal phyla that do not have true differentiated tissues (such as the sponges), called Parazoa.
7.27.197	Both Parazoa and Eumetazoa evolved from a common ancestral organism that resembles the modern-day protists called choanoflagellates.
7.27.198	These protist cells strongly resemble the sponge choanocyte cells today.
7.27.199	Cells of the protist choanoflagellate resemble sponge choanocyte cells.
7.27.200	Beating of choanocyte flagella draws water through the sponge so that nutrients can be extracted and waste removed.
7.27.201	Eumetazoa are subdivided into radially symmetrical animals and bilaterally symmetrical animals, and are thus classified into clade Bilateria or Radiata, respectively.
7.27.202	As mentioned earlier, the cnidarians and ctenophores are animal phyla with true radial symmetry.
7.27.203	All other Eumetazoa are members of the Bilateria clade.
7.27.204	The bilaterally symmetrical animals are further divided into deuterostomes (including chordates and echinoderms) and two distinct clades of protostomes (including ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans) (Figure 27.13ab).
7.27.205	Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group: exoskeletal molting (termed ecdysis).
7.27.206	Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features, each common to certain phyla within the clade.
7.27.207	Some lophotrochozoan phyla are characterized by a larval stage called trochophore larvae, and other phyla are characterized by the presence of a feeding structure called a lophophore.
7.27.208	Animals that molt their exoskeletons, such as these (a) Madagascar hissing cockroaches, are in the clade Ecdysozoa.
7.27.209	(b) Phoronids are in the clade Lophotrochozoa.
7.27.210	The tentacles are part of a feeding structure called a lophophore.
7.27.211	Modern Advances in Phylogenetic Understanding Come from Molecular Analyses
7.27.212	The phylogenetic groupings are continually being debated and refined by evolutionary biologists.
7.27.213	Each year, new evidence emerges that further alters the relationships described by a phylogenetic tree diagram.
7.27.214	Nucleic acid and protein analyses have greatly informed the modern phylogenetic animal tree.
7.27.215	These data come from a variety of molecular sources, such as mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and certain cellular proteins.
7.27.216	Many evolutionary relationships in the modern tree have only recently been determined due to molecular evidence.
7.27.217	For example, a previously classified group of animals called lophophorates, which included brachiopods and bryozoans, were long-thought to be primitive deuterostomes.
7.27.218	Extensive molecular analysis using rRNA data found these animals to be protostomes, more closely related to annelids and mollusks.
7.27.219	This discovery allowed for the distinction of the protostome clade, the lophotrochozoans.
7.27.220	Molecular data have also shed light on some differences within the lophotrochozoan group, and some scientists believe that the phyla Platyhelminthes and Rotifera within this group should actually belong to their own group of protostomes termed Platyzoa.
7.27.221	Molecular research similar to the discoveries that brought about the distinction of the lophotrochozoan clade has also revealed a dramatic rearrangement of the relationships between mollusks, annelids, arthropods, and nematodes, and a new ecdysozoan clade was formed.
7.27.222	Due to morphological similarities in their segmented body types, annelids and arthropods were once thought to be closely related.
7.27.223	However, molecular evidence has revealed that arthropods are actually more closely related to nematodes, now comprising the ecdysozoan clade, and annelids are more closely related to mollusks, brachiopods, and other phyla in the lophotrochozoan clade.
7.27.224	These two clades now make up the protostomes.
7.27.225	Another change to former phylogenetic groupings because of molecular analyses includes the emergence of an entirely new phylum of worm called Acoelomorpha.
7.27.226	These acoel flatworms were long thought to belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes because of their similar “flatworm” morphology.
7.27.227	However, molecular analyses revealed this to be a false relationship and originally suggested that acoels represented living species of some of the earliest divergent bilaterians.
7.27.228	More recent research into the acoelomorphs has called this hypothesis into question and suggested a closer relationship with deuterostomes.
7.27.229	The placement of this new phylum remains disputed, but scientists agree that with sufficient molecular data, their true phylogeny will be determined.
7.27.230	Many questions regarding the origins and evolutionary history of the animal kingdom continue to be researched and debated, as new fossil and molecular evidence change prevailing theories.
7.27.231	Some of these questions include the following: How long have animals existed on Earth?
7.27.232	What were the earliest members of the animal kingdom, and what organism was their common ancestor?
7.27.233	While animal diversity increased during the Cambrian period of the Paleozoic era, 530 million years ago, modern fossil evidence suggests that primitive animal species existed much earlier.
7.27.234	Pre-Cambrian Animal Life
7.27.235	The time before the Cambrian period is known as the Ediacaran period (from about 635 million years ago to 543 million years ago), the final period of the late Proterozoic Neoproterozoic Era (Figure 27.14).
7.27.236	It is believed that early animal life, termed Ediacaran biota, evolved from protists at this time.
7.27.237	Some protest species called choanoflagellates closely resemble the choanocyte cells in the simplest animals, sponges.
7.27.238	In addition to their morphological similarity, molecular analyses have revealed similar sequence homologies in their DNA.
7.27.239	Earth’s history is divided into eons, eras, and periods.
7.27.240	Note that the Ediacaran period starts in the Proterozoic eon and ends in the Cambrian period of the Phanerozoic eon.
7.27.241	(b) Stages on the geological time scale are represented as a spiral.
7.27.242	The earliest life comprising Ediacaran biota was long believed to include only tiny, sessile, soft-bodied sea creatures.
7.27.243	However, recently there has been increasing scientific evidence suggesting that more varied and complex animal species lived during this time, and possibly even before the Ediacaran period.
7.27.244	Fossils believed to represent the oldest animals with hard body parts were recently discovered in South Australia.
7.27.245	These sponge-like fossils, named Coronacollina acula, date back as far as 560 million years, and are believed to show the existence of hard body parts and spicules that extended 20–40 cm from the main body (estimated about 5 cm long).
7.27.246	Other fossils from the Ediacaran period are shown in Figure 27.15ab.
7.27.247	Fossils of (a) Cyclomedusa and (b) Dickinsonia date to 650 million years ago, during the Ediacaran period.
7.27.248	Another recent fossil discovery may represent the earliest animal species ever found.
7.27.249	While the validity of this claim is still under investigation, these primitive fossils appear to be small, one-centimeter long, sponge-like creatures.
7.27.250	These fossils from South Australia date back 650 million years, actually placing the putative animal before the great ice age extinction event that marked the transition between the Cryogenian period and the Ediacaran period.
7.27.251	Until this discovery, most scientists believed that there was no animal life prior to the Ediacaran period.
7.27.252	Many scientists now believe that animals may in fact have evolved during the Cryogenian period.
7.27.253	The Cambrian Explosion of Animal Life
7.27.254	The Cambrian period, occurring between approximately 542–488 million years ago, marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla and animal diversity in Earth’s history.
7.27.255	It is believed that most of the animal phyla in existence today had their origins during this time, often referred to as the Cambrian explosion (Figure 27.16).
7.27.256	Echinoderms, mollusks, worms, arthropods, and chordates arose during this period.
7.27.257	One of the most dominant species during the Cambrian period was the trilobite, an arthropod that was among the first animals to exhibit a sense of vision
7.27.258	(Figure 27.17abcd).
7.27.259	An artist’s rendition depicts some organisms from the Cambrian period.
7.27.260	These fossils (a–d) belong to trilobites, extinct arthropods that appeared in the early Cambrian period, 525 million years ago, and disappeared from the fossil record during a mass extinction at the end of the Permian period, about 250 million years ago.
7.27.261	The cause of the Cambrian explosion is still debated.
7.27.262	There are many theories that attempt to answer this question.
7.27.263	Environmental changes may have created a more suitable environment for animal life.
7.27.264	Examples of these changes include rising atmospheric oxygen levels and large increases in oceanic calcium concentrations that preceded the Cambrian period.
7.27.265	Some scientists believe that an expansive, continental shelf with numerous shallow lagoons or pools provided the necessary living space for larger numbers of different types of animals to co-exist.
7.27.266	There is also support for theories that argue that ecological relationships between species, such as changes in the food web, competition for food and space, and predator-prey relationships, were primed to promote a sudden massive coevolution of species.
7.27.267	Yet other theories claim genetic and developmental reasons for the Cambrian explosion.
7.27.268	The morphological flexibility and complexity of animal development afforded by the evolution of Hox control genes may have provided the necessary opportunities for increases in possible animal morphologies at the time of the Cambrian period.
7.27.269	Theories that attempt to explain why the Cambrian explosion happened must be able to provide valid reasons for the massive animal diversification, as well as explain why it happened when it did.
7.27.270	There is evidence that both supports and refutes each of the theories described above, and the answer may very well be a combination of these and other theories.
7.27.271	The oxygen concentration in Earth’s atmosphere rose sharply around 300 million years ago.
7.27.272	However, unresolved questions about the animal diversification that took place during the Cambrian period remain.
7.27.273	For example, we do not understand how the evolution of so many species occurred in such a short period of time.
7.27.274	Was there really an “explosion” of life at this particular time?
7.27.275	Some scientists question the validity of the this idea, because there is increasing evidence to suggest that more animal life existed prior to the Cambrian period and that other similar species’ so-called explosions (or radiations) occurred later in history as well.
7.27.276	Furthermore, the vast diversification of animal species that appears to have begun during the Cambrian period continued well into the following Ordovician period.
7.27.277	Despite some of these arguments, most scientists agree that the Cambrian period marked a time of impressively rapid animal evolution and diversification that is unmatched elsewhere during history.
7.27.278	Post-Cambrian Evolution and Mass Extinctions
7.27.279	The periods that followed the Cambrian during the Paleozoic Era are marked by further animal evolution and the emergence of many new orders, families, and species.
7.27.280	As animal phyla continued to diversify, new species adapted to new ecological niches.
7.27.281	During the Ordovician period, which followed the Cambrian period, plant life first appeared on land.
7.27.282	This change allowed formerly aquatic animal species to invade land, feeding directly on plants or decaying vegetation.
7.27.283	Continual changes in temperature and moisture throughout the remainder of the Paleozoic Era due to continental plate movements encouraged the development of new adaptations to terrestrial existence in animals, such as limbed appendages in amphibians and epidermal scales in reptiles.
7.27.284	Changes in the environment often create new niches (living spaces) that contribute to rapid speciation and increased diversity.
7.27.285	On the other hand, cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life, can result in devastating losses of diversity.
7.27.286	Such periods of mass extinction (Figure 27.19) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life, erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind.
7.27.287	The end of the Permian period (and the Paleozoic Era) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth’s history, a loss of roughly 95 percent of the extant species at that time.
7.27.288	Some of the dominant phyla in the world’s oceans, such as the trilobites, disappeared completely.
7.27.289	On land, the disappearance of some dominant species of Permian reptiles made it possible for a new line of reptiles to emerge, the dinosaurs.
7.27.290	The warm and stable climatic conditions of the ensuing Mesozoic Era promoted an explosive diversification of dinosaurs into every conceivable niche in land, air, and water.
7.27.291	Plants, too, radiated into new landscapes and empty niches, creating complex communities of producers and consumers, some of which became very large on the abundant food available.
7.27.292	Another mass extinction event occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period, bringing the Mesozoic Era to an end.
7.27.293	Skies darkened and temperatures fell as a large meteor impact and tons of volcanic ash blocked incoming sunlight.
7.27.294	Plants died, herbivores and carnivores starved, and the mostly cold-blooded dinosaurs ceded their dominance of the landscape to more warm-blooded mammals.
7.27.295	In the following Cenozoic Era, mammals radiated into terrestrial and aquatic niches once occupied by dinosaurs, and birds, the warm-blooded offshoots of one line of the ruling reptiles, became aerial specialists.
7.27.296	The appearance and dominance of flowering plants in the Cenozoic Era created new niches for insects, as well as for birds and mammals.
7.27.297	Changes in animal species diversity during the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic were also promoted by a dramatic shift in Earth’s geography, as continental plates slid over the crust into their current positions, leaving some animal groups isolated on islands and continents, or separated by mountain ranges or inland seas from other competitors.
7.27.298	Early in the Cenozoic, new ecosystems appeared, with the evolution of grasses and coral reefs.
7.27.299	Late in the Cenozoic, further extinctions followed by speciation occurred during ice ages that covered high latitudes with ice and then retreated, leaving new open spaces for colonization.
7.28.0	A brief look at any magazine pertaining to our natural world, such as National Geographic, would show a rich variety of vertebrates, especially mammals and birds.
7.28.1	To most people, these are the animals that attract our attention.
7.28.2	Concentrating on vertebrates, however, gives us a rather biased and limited view of biodiversity, because it ignores nearly 97 percent of the animal kingdom, namely the invertebrates.
7.28.3	Invertebrate animals are those without a cranium and defined vertebral column or spine.
7.28.4	In addition to lacking a spine, most invertebrates also lack an endoskeleton.
7.28.5	A large number of invertebrates are aquatic animals, and scientific research suggests that many of the world’s species are aquatic invertebrates that have not yet been documented.
7.28.6	The invertebrates, or invertebrata, are animals that do not contain bony structures, such as the cranium and vertebrae.
7.28.7	The simplest of all the invertebrates are the Parazoans, which include only the phylum Porifera: the sponges (Figure 28.2).
7.28.8	Parazoans (“beside animals”) do not display tissue-level organization, although they do have specialized cells that perform specific functions.
7.28.9	Sponge larvae are able to swim; however, adults are non-motile and spend their life attached to a substratum.
7.28.10	Since water is vital to sponges for excretion, feeding, and gas exchange, their body structure facilitates the movement of water through the sponge.
7.28.11	Structures such as canals, chambers, and cavities enable water to move through the sponge to nearly all body cells.
7.28.12	Sponges are members of the Phylum Porifera, which contains the simplest invertebrates.
7.28.13	Morphology of Sponges
7.28.14	The morphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of a cylinder with a large central cavity, the spongocoel, occupying the inside of the cylinder.
7.28.15	Water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall.
7.28.16	Water entering the spongocoel is extruded via a large common opening called the osculum.
7.28.17	However, sponges exhibit a range of diversity in body forms, including variations in the size of the spongocoel, the number of osculi, and where the cells that filter food from the water are located.
7.28.18	While sponges (excluding the hexactinellids) do not exhibit tissue-layer organization, they do have different cell types that perform distinct functions.
7.28.19	Pinacocytes, which are epithelial-like cells, form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jelly-like substance called mesohyl.
7.28.20	Mesohyl is an extracellular matrix consisting of a collagen-like gel with suspended cells that perform various functions.
7.28.21	The gel-like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges.
7.28.22	In addition to the osculum, sponges have multiple pores called ostia on their bodies that allow water to enter the sponge.
7.28.23	In some sponges, ostia are formed by porocytes, single tube-shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel.
7.28.24	In other sponges, ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge.
7.28.25	Choanocytes (“collar cells”) are present at various locations, depending on the type of sponge, but they always line the inner portions of some space through which water flows (the spongocoel in simple sponges, canals within the body wall in more complex sponges, and chambers scattered throughout the body in the most complex sponges).
7.28.26	Whereas pinacocytes line the outside of the sponge, choanocytes tend to line certain inner portions of the sponge body that surround the mesohyl.
7.28.27	The structure of a choanocyte is critical to its function, which is to generate a water current through the sponge and to trap and ingest food particles by phagocytosis.
7.28.28	Note the similarity in appearance between the sponge choanocyte and choanoflagellates (Protista).
7.28.29	This similarity suggests that sponges and choanoflagellates are closely related and likely share a recent common ancestry.
7.28.30	The cell body is embedded in mesohyl and contains all organelles required for normal cell function, but protruding into the “open space” inside of the sponge is a mesh-like collar composed of microvilli with a single flagellum in the center of the column.
7.28.31	The cumulative effect of the flagella from all choanocytes aids the movement of water through the sponge: drawing water into the sponge through the numerous ostia, into the spaces lined by choanocytes, and eventually out through the osculum (or osculi).
7.28.32	In the meantime, food particles, including waterborne bacteria and algae, are trapped by the sieve-like collar of the choanocytes, slide down into the body of the cell, are ingested by phagocytosis, and become encased in a food vacuole.
7.28.33	Lastly, choanocytes will differentiate into sperm for sexual reproduction, where they will become dislodged from the mesohyl and leave the sponge with expelled water through the osculum.
7.28.34	The second crucial cells in sponges are called amoebocytes (or archaeocytes), named for the fact that they move throughout the mesohyl in an amoeba-like fashion.
7.28.35	Amoebocytes have a variety of functions: delivering nutrients from choanocytes to other cells within the sponge, giving rise to eggs for sexual reproduction (which remain in the mesohyl), delivering phagocytized sperm from choanocytes to eggs, and differentiating into more-specific cell types.
7.28.36	Some of these morespecific cell types include collencytes and lophocytes, which produce the collagen-like protein to maintain the mesohyl, sclerocytes, which produce spicules in some sponges, and spongocytes, which produce the protein spongin in the majority of sponges.
7.28.37	These cells produce collagen to maintain the consistency of the mesohyl.
7.28.38	The different cell types in sponges are shown in Figure 28.3.
7.28.39	In some sponges, sclerocytes secrete small spicules into the mesohyl, which are composed of either calcium carbonate or silica, depending on the type of sponge.
7.28.40	These spicules serve to provide additional stiffness to the body of the sponge.
7.28.41	The presence and composition of spicules/spongin are the differentiating characteristics of the three classes of sponges (Figure 28.4): Class Calcarea contains calcium carbonate spicules and no spongin, class Hexactinellida contains six-rayed siliceous spicules and no spongin, and class Demospongia contains spongin and may or may not have spicules; if present, those spicules are siliceous.
7.28.42	Spicules are most conspicuously present in class Hexactinellida, the order consisting of glass sponges.
7.28.43	Some of the spicules may attain giant proportions (in relation to the typical size range of glass sponges of 3 to 10 mm) as seen in Monorhaphis chuni, which grows up to 3 m long.
7.28.44	Clathrina clathrus belongs to class Calcarea, (b) Staurocalyptus spp.
7.28.45	(common name: yellow Picasso sponge) belongs to class Hexactinellida, and (c) Acarnus erithacus belongs to class Demospongia.
7.28.46	Physiological Processes in Sponges Sponges, despite being simple organisms, regulate their different physiological processes through a variety of mechanisms.
7.28.47	These processes regulate their metabolism, reproduction, and locomotion.
7.28.48	Digestion Sponges lack complex digestive, respiratory, circulatory, reproductive, and nervous systems.
7.28.49	Their food is trapped when water passes through the ostia and out through the osculum.
7.28.50	Bacteria smaller than 0.5 microns in size are trapped by choanocytes, which are the principal cells engaged in nutrition, and are ingested by phagocytosis.
7.28.51	Particles that are larger than the ostia may be phagocytized by pinacocytes.
7.28.52	In some sponges, amoebocytes transport food from cells that have ingested food particles to those that do not.
7.28.53	For this type of digestion, in which food particles are digested within individual cells, the sponge draws water through diffusion.
7.28.54	The limit of this type of digestion is that food particles must be smaller than individual cells.
7.28.55	All other major body functions in the sponge (gas exchange, circulation, excretion) are performed by diffusion between the cells that line the openings within the sponge and the water that is passing through those openings.
7.28.56	All cell types within the sponge obtain oxygen from water through diffusion.
7.28.57	Likewise, carbon dioxide is released into seawater by diffusion.
7.28.58	In addition, nitrogenous waste produced as a byproduct of protein metabolism is excreted via diffusion by individual cells into the water as it passes through the sponge.
7.28.59	Reproduction Sponges reproduce by sexual as well as asexual methods.
7.28.60	The typical means of asexual reproduction is either fragmentation (where a piece of the sponge breaks off, settles on a new substrate, and develops into a new individual) or budding (a genetically identical outgrowth grows from the parent and eventually detaches or remains attached to form a colony).
7.28.61	An atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules.
7.28.62	Gemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges wherein the typical sponge morphology is inverted.
7.28.63	In gemmules, an inner layer of amoebocytes is surrounded by a layer of collagen (spongin) that may be reinforced by spicules.
7.28.64	The collagen that is normally found in the mesohyl becomes the outer protective layer.
7.28.65	In freshwater sponges, gemmules may survive hostile environmental conditions like changes in temperature and serve to recolonize the habitat once environmental conditions stabilize.
7.28.66	Gemmules are capable of attaching to a substratum and generating a new sponge.
7.28.67	Since gemmules can withstand harsh environments, are resistant to desiccation, and remain dormant for long periods, they are an excellent means of colonization for a sessile organism.
7.28.68	Sexual reproduction in sponges occurs when gametes are generated.
7.28.69	Sponges are monoecious (hermaphroditic), which means that one individual can produce both gametes (eggs and sperm) simultaneously.
7.28.70	In some sponges, production of gametes may occur throughout the year, whereas other sponges may show sexual cycles depending upon water temperature.
7.28.71	Sponges may also become sequentially hermaphroditic, producing oocytes first and spermatozoa later.
7.28.72	Oocytes arise by the differentiation of amoebocytes and are retained within the spongocoel, whereas spermatozoa result from the differentiation of choanocytes and are ejected via the osculum.
7.28.73	Ejection of spermatozoa may be a timed and coordinated event, as seen in certain species.
7.28.74	Spermatozoa carried along by water currents can fertilize the oocytes borne in the mesohyl of other sponges.
7.28.75	Early larval development occurs within the sponge, and free-swimming larvae are then released via the osculum.
7.28.76	Locomotion Sponges are generally sessile as adults and spend their lives attached to a fixed substratum.
7.28.77	They do not show movement over large distances like other free-swimming marine invertebrates.
7.28.78	However, sponge cells are capable of creeping along substrata via organizational plasticity.
7.28.79	Under experimental conditions, researchers have shown that sponge cells spread on a physical support demonstrate a leading edge for directed movement.
7.28.80	It has been speculated that this localized creeping movement may help sponges adjust to microenvironments near the point of attachment.
7.28.81	It must be noted, however, that this pattern of movement has been documented in laboratories, but it remains to be observed in natural sponge habitats.
7.28.82	Phylum Cnidaria includes animals that show radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic, that is, they develop from two embryonic layers.
7.28.83	Nearly all (about 99 percent) cnidarians are marine species.
7.28.84	Cnidarians contain specialized cells known as cnidocytes (“stinging cells”) containing organelles called nematocysts (stingers).
7.28.85	These cells are present around the mouth and tentacles, and serve to immobilize prey with toxins contained within the cells.
7.28.86	Nematocysts contain coiled threads that may bear barbs.
7.28.87	The outer wall of the cell has hairlike projections called cnidocils, which are sensitive to touch.
7.28.88	When touched, the cells are known to fire coiled threads that can either penetrate the flesh of the prey or predators of cnidarians (see Figure 28.5) or ensnare it.
7.28.89	These coiled threads release toxins into the target and can often immobilize prey or scare away predators.
7.28.90	Animals from the phylum Cnidaria have stinging cells called cnidocytes.
7.28.91	Cnidocytes contain large organelles called (a) nematocysts that store a coiled thread and barb.
7.28.92	When hairlike projections on the cell surface are touched, (b) the thread, barb, and a toxin are fired from the organelle.
7.28.93	Animals in this phylum display two distinct morphological body plans: polyp or “stalk” and medusa or “bell
7.28.94	” (Figure 28.6).
7.28.95	An example of the polyp form is Hydra spp.; perhaps the most well-known medusoid animals are the jellies (jellyfish).
7.28.96	Polyp forms are sessile as adults, with a single opening to the digestive system (the mouth) facing up with tentacles surrounding it.
7.28.97	Medusa forms are motile, with the mouth and tentacles hanging down from an umbrella-shaped bell.
7.28.98	Cnidarians have two distinct body plans, the medusa (a) and the polyp (b).
7.28.99	All cnidarians have two membrane layers, with a jelly-like mesoglea between them.
7.28.100	Some cnidarians are polymorphic, that is, they have two body plans during their life cycle.
7.28.101	An example is the colonial hydroid called an Obelia.
7.28.102	The sessile polyp form has, in fact, two types of polyps, shown in Figure 28.7.
7.28.103	The first is the gastrozooid, which is adapted for capturing prey and feeding; the other type of polyp is the gonozooid, adapted for the asexual budding of medusa.
7.28.104	When the reproductive buds mature, they break off and become free-swimming medusa, which are either male or female (dioecious).
7.28.105	The male medusa makes sperm, whereas the female medusa makes eggs.
7.28.106	After fertilization, the zygote develops into a blastula, which develops into a planula larva.
7.28.107	The larva is free swimming for a while, but eventually attaches and a new colonial reproductive polyp is formed.
7.28.108	The sessile form of Obelia geniculate has two types of polyps: gastrozooids, which are adapted for capturing prey, and gonozooids, which bud to produce medusae asexually.
7.28.109	All cnidarians show the presence of two membrane layers in the body that are derived from the endoderm and ectoderm of the embryo.
7.28.110	The outer layer (from ectoderm) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal, whereas the inner layer (from endoderm) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity.
7.28.111	Between these two membrane layers is a non-living, jelly-like mesoglea connective layer.
7.28.112	In terms of cellular complexity, cnidarians show the presence of differentiated cell types in each tissue layer, such as nerve cells, contractile epithelial cells, enzyme-secreting cells, and nutrient-absorbing cells, as well as the presence of intercellular connections.
7.28.113	However, the development of organs or organ systems is not advanced in this phylum.
7.28.114	The nervous system is primitive, with nerve cells scattered across the body.
7.28.115	This nerve net may show the presence of groups of cells in the form of nerve plexi (singular plexus) or nerve cords.
7.28.116	The nerve cells show mixed characteristics of motor as well as sensory neurons.
7.28.117	The predominant signaling molecules in these primitive nervous systems are chemical peptides, which perform both excitatory and inhibitory functions.
7.28.118	Despite the simplicity of the nervous system, it coordinates the movement of tentacles, the drawing of captured prey to the mouth, the digestion of food, and the expulsion of waste.
7.28.119	The cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity, enzymes are secreted into the cavity, and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients.
7.28.120	The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus, which is termed an incomplete digestive system.
7.28.121	Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis with water in the environment, and between cells in the gastrodermis with water in the gastrovascular cavity.
7.28.122	The lack of a circulatory system to move dissolved gases limits the thickness of the body wall and necessitates a non-living mesoglea between the layers.
7.28.123	There is no excretory system or organs, and nitrogenous wastes simply diffuse from the cells into the water outside the animal or in the gastrovascular cavity.
7.28.124	There is also no circulatory system, so nutrients must move from the cells that absorb them in the lining of the gastrovascular cavity through the mesoglea to other cells.
7.28.125	The phylum Cnidaria contains about 10,000 described species divided into four classes:
7.28.126	Anthozoa, Scyphozoa, Cubozoa, and Hydrozoa.
7.28.127	The anthozoans, the sea anemones and corals, are all sessile species, whereas the scyphozoans (jellyfish) and cubozoans (box jellies) are swimming forms.
7.28.128	The hydrozoans contain sessile forms and swimming colonial forms like the Portuguese Man O’ War.
7.28.129	Class Anthozoa
7.28.130	The class Anthozoa includes all cnidarians that exhibit a polyp body plan only; in other words, there is no medusa stage within their life cycle.
7.28.131	Examples include sea anemones (Figure 28.8), sea pens, and corals, with an estimated number of 6,100 described species.
7.28.132	Sea anemones are usually brightly colored and can attain a size of 1.8 to 10 cm in diameter.
7.28.133	These animals are usually cylindrical in shape and are attached to a substrate.
7.28.134	A mouth opening is surrounded by tentacles bearing cnidocytes.
7.28.135	The sea anemone is shown (a) photographed and (b) in a diagram illustrating its morphology.
7.28.136	A jelly is shown (a) photographed and (b) in a diagram illustrating its morphology.
7.28.137	In the jellyfish, a mouth opening is present on the underside of the animal, surrounded by tentacles bearing nematocysts.
7.28.138	Scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores.
7.28.139	The mouth leads to the gastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, called diverticuli.
7.28.140	In some species, the digestive system may be further branched into radial canals.
7.28.141	Like the septa in anthozoans, the branched gastrovascular cells serve two functions: to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and diffusion; thus, more cells are in direct contact with the nutrients in the gastrovascular cavity.
7.28.142	In scyphozoans, nerve cells are scattered all over the body.
7.28.143	Neurons may even be present in clusters called rhopalia.
7.28.144	These animals possess a ring of muscles lining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water.
7.28.145	Scyphozoans are dioecious animals, that is, the sexes are separate.
7.28.146	The gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are expelled through the mouth.
7.28.147	Planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form known as scyphistoma.
7.28.148	These forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form.
7.28.149	The life cycle (Figure 28.10) of these animals can be described as polymorphic, because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle.
7.28.150	The lifecycle of a jellyfish includes two stages: the medusa stage and the polyp stage.
7.28.151	The polyp reproduces asexually by budding, and the medusa reproduces sexually.
7.28.152	Class Cubozoa
7.28.153	This class includes jellies that have a box-shaped medusa, or a bell that is square in cross-section; hence, are colloquially known as “box jellyfish.
7.28.154	”
7.28.155	These species may achieve sizes of 15–25 cm.
7.28.156	Cubozoans display overall morphological and anatomical characteristics that are similar to those of the scyphozoans.
7.28.157	A prominent difference between the two classes is the arrangement of tentacles.
7.28.158	This is the most venomous group of all the cnidarians (Figure 28.11).
7.28.159	The cubozoans contain muscular pads called pedalia at the corners of the square bell canopy, with one or more tentacles attached to each pedalium.
7.28.160	These animals are further classified into orders based on the presence of single or multiple tentacles per pedalium.
7.28.161	In some cases, the digestive system may extend into the pedalia.
7.28.162	Nematocysts may be arranged in a spiral configuration along the tentacles; this arrangement helps to effectively subdue and capture prey.
7.28.163	Cubozoans exist in a polypoid form that develops from a planula larva.
7.28.164	These polyps show limited mobility along the substratum and, like scyphozoans, may bud to form more polyps to colonize a habitat.
7.28.165	Polyp forms then transform into the medusoid forms.
7.28.166	The (a) tiny cubazoan jelly
7.28.167	Malo kingi is thimble shaped and, like all cubozoan jellies, (b) has four muscular pedalia to which the tentacles attach.
7.28.168	M. kingi is one of two species of jellies known to cause Irukandji syndrome, a condition characterized by excruciating muscle pain, vomiting, increased heart rate, and psychological symptoms.
7.28.169	Two people in Australia, where Irukandji jellies are most commonly found, are believed to have died from Irukandji stings.
7.28.170	(c) A sign on a beach in northern Australia warns swimmers of the danger.
7.28.171	Class Hydrozoa Hydrozoa includes nearly 3,200 species; most are marine, although some freshwater species are known (Figure 28.12).
7.28.172	Animals in this class are polymorphs, and most exhibit both polypoid and medusoid forms in their lifecycle, although this is variable.
7.28.173	The polyp form in these animals often shows a cylindrical morphology with a central gastrovascular cavity lined by the gastrodermis.
7.28.174	The gastrodermis and epidermis have a simple layer of mesoglea sandwiched between them.
7.28.175	A mouth opening, surrounded by tentacles, is present at the oral end of the animal.
7.28.176	Many hydrozoans form colonies that are composed of a branched colony of specialized polyps that share a gastrovascular cavity, such as in the colonial hydroid Obelia.
7.28.177	Colonies may also be free-floating and contain medusoid and polypoid individuals in the colony as in Physalia (the Portuguese Man O’War) or Velella (By-the-wind sailor).
7.28.178	Even other species are solitary polyps (Hydra) or solitary medusae (Gonionemus).
7.28.179	The true characteristic shared by all of these diverse species is that their gonads for sexual reproduction are derived from epidermal tissue, whereas in all other cnidarians they are derived from gastrodermal tissue.
7.28.180	Obelia, (b)
7.28.181	Physalia physalis, known as the Portuguese Man O‘ War, (c) Velella bae, and (d)
7.28.182	Hydra have different body shapes but all belong to the family Hydrozoa.
7.28.183	Animals belonging to superphylum Lophotrochozoa are protostomes, in which the blastopore, or the point of involution of the ectoderm or outer germ layer, becomes the mouth opening to the alimentary canal.
7.28.184	This is called protostomy or “first mouth.
7.28.185	”
7.28.186	In protostomy, solid groups of cells split from the endoderm or inner germ layer to form a central mesodermal layer of cells.
7.28.187	This layer multiplies into a band and then splits internally to form the coelom; this protostomic coelom is hence termed schizocoelom.
7.28.188	As lophotrochozoans, the organisms in this superphylum possess either a lophophore or trochophore larvae.
7.28.189	The lophophores include groups that are united by the presence of the lophophore, a set of ciliated tentacles surrounding the mouth.
7.28.190	Lophophorata include the flatworms and several other phyla.
7.28.191	These clades are upheld when RNA sequences are compared.
7.28.192	Trochophore larvae are characterized by two bands of cilia around the body.
7.28.193	The lophotrochozoans are triploblastic and possess an embryonic mesoderm sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm found in the diploblastic cnidarians.
7.28.194	These phyla are also bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section will divide them into right and left sides that are symmetrical.
7.28.195	It also means the beginning of cephalization, the evolution of a concentration of nervous tissues and sensory organs in the head of the organism, which is where it first encounters its environment.
7.28.196	Phylum Platyhelminthes
7.28.197	The flatworms are acoelomate organisms that include many free-living and parasitic forms.
7.28.198	Most of the flatworms are classified in the superphylum Lophotrochozoa, which also includes the mollusks and annelids.
7.28.199	The Platyhelminthes consist of two lineages: the Catenulida and the Rhabditophora.
7.28.200	The Catenulida, or "chain worms" is a small clade of just over 100 species.
7.28.201	These worms typically reproduce asexually by budding.
7.28.202	However, the offspring do not fully attach from the parents and, resemble a chain in appearance.
7.28.203	All of the remaining flatworms discussed here are part of the Rhabditophora.
7.28.204	Many flatworms are parasitic, including important parasites of humans.
7.28.205	Flatworms have three embryonic tissue layers that give rise to surfaces that cover tissues (from ectoderm), internal tissues (from mesoderm), and line the digestive system (from endoderm).
7.28.206	The epidermal tissue is a single layer cells or a layer of fused cells (syncytium) that covers a layer of circular muscle above a layer of longitudinal muscle.
7.28.207	The mesodermal tissues include mesenchymal cells that contain collagen and support secretory cells that secrete mucus and other materials at the surface.
7.28.208	The flatworms are acoelomates, so their bodies are solid between the outer surface and the cavity of the digestive system.
7.28.209	Physiological Processes of Flatworms
7.28.210	The free-living species of flatworms are predators or scavengers.
7.28.211	Parasitic forms feed on the tissues of their hosts.
7.28.212	Most flatworms, such as the planarian shown in Figure 28.13, have a gastrovascular cavity rather than a complete digestive system.
7.28.213	In such animals, the “mouth” is also used to expel waste materials from the digestive system.
7.28.214	Some species also have an anal opening.
7.28.215	The gut may be a simple sac or highly branched.
7.28.216	Digestion is extracellular, with digested materials taken in to the cells of the gut lining by phagocytosis.
7.28.217	One group, the cestodes, lacks a digestive system.
7.28.218	Flatworms have an excretory system with a network of tubules throughout the body with openings to the environment and nearby flame cells, whose cilia beat to direct waste fluids concentrated in the tubules out of the body.
7.28.219	The system is responsible for the regulation of dissolved salts and the excretion of nitrogenous wastes.
7.28.220	The nervous system consists of a pair of nerve cords running the length of the body with connections between them and a large ganglion or concentration of nerves at the anterior end of the worm, where there may also be a concentration of photosensory and chemosensory cells.
7.28.221	There is neither a circulatory nor respiratory system, with gas and nutrient exchange dependent on diffusion and cell-cell junctions.
7.28.222	This necessarily limits the thickness of the body in these organisms, constraining them to be “flat” worms.
7.28.223	Most flatworm species are monoecious, and fertilization is typically internal.
7.28.224	Asexual reproduction is common in some groups.
7.28.225	The planarian is a flatworm that has a gastrovascular cavity with one opening that serves as both mouth and anus.
7.28.226	The excretory system is made up of tubules connected to excretory pores on both sides of the body.
7.28.227	The nervous system is composed of two interconnected nerve cords running the length of the body, with cerebral ganglia and eyespots at the anterior end.
7.28.228	Diversity of Flatworms Platyhelminthes are traditionally divided into four classes: Turbellaria, Monogenea, Trematoda, and Cestoda (Figure 28.14).
7.28.229	As discussed above, the relationships among members of these classes is being reassessed, with the turbellarians in particular now viewed as a paraphyletic group, a group that does not have a single common ancestor.
7.28.230	Phylum Platyhelminthes is divided into four classes.
7.28.231	(a) Class Turbellaria includes the Bedford’s flatworm (Pseudobiceros bedfordi), which is about 8–10 cm in length.
7.28.232	(b)
7.28.233	The parasitic class Monogenea includes Dactylogyrus spp.
7.28.234	Dactylogyrus, commonly called a gill fluke, is about 0.2 mm in length and has two anchors, indicated by arrows, that it uses to latch onto the gills of host fish.
7.28.235	(c)
7.28.236	The Trematoda class includes Fascioloides magna (right) and Fasciaola hepatica (two specimens of left, also known as the common liver fluke).
7.28.237	(d)
7.28.238	Class Cestoda includes tapeworms such as this Taenia saginata.
7.28.239	T. saginata, which infects both cattle and humans, can reach 4–10 meters in length; the specimen shown here is about 4 meters.
7.28.240	The class Turbellaria includes mainly free-living, marine species, although some species live in freshwater or moist terrestrial environments.
7.28.241	The ventral epidermis of turbellarians is ciliated and facilitates their locomotion.
7.28.242	Some turbellarians are capable of remarkable feats of regeneration in which they may regrow the body, even from a small fragment.
7.28.243	The monogeneans are ectoparasites, mostly of fish, with simple lifecycles that consist of a free-swimming larva that attaches to a fish to begin transformation to the parasitic adult form.
7.28.244	The parasite has only one host and that host is usually only one species.
7.28.245	The worms may produce enzymes that digest the host tissues or simply graze on surface mucus and skin particles.
7.28.246	Most monogeneans are hermaphroditic, but the male gametes develop first and so cross-fertilization is quite common.
7.28.247	The trematodes, or flukes, are internal parasites of mollusks and many other groups, including humans.
7.28.248	Trematodes have complex lifecycles that involve a primary host in which sexual reproduction occurs, and one or more secondary hosts in which asexual reproduction occurs.
7.28.249	The primary host is almost always a mollusk.
7.28.250	Trematodes are responsible for serious human diseases including schistosomiasis, a blood fluke.
7.28.251	The disease infects an estimated 200 million people in the tropics, leading to organ damage and chronic symptoms like fatigue.
7.28.252	Infection occurs when the human enters the water and a larva, released from the primary snail host, locates and penetrates the skin.
7.28.253	The parasite infects various organs in the body and feeds on red blood cells before reproducing.
7.28.254	Many of the eggs are released in feces and find their way into a waterway, where they are able to reinfect the primary snail host.
7.28.255	The cestodes, or tapeworms, are also internal parasites, mainly of vertebrates (Figure 28.15).
7.28.256	Tapeworms live in the intestinal tract of the primary host and remain fixed using a sucker on the anterior end, or scolex, of the tapeworm body.
7.28.257	The remaining body of the tapeworm is made up of a long series of units called proglottids, each of which may contain an excretory system with flame cells, but contain reproductive structures, both male and female.
7.28.258	Tapeworms do not possess a digestive system; instead, they absorb nutrients from the food matter passing them in the host’s intestine.
7.28.259	Proglottids are produced at the scolex and gradually migrate to the end of the tapeworm; at this point, they are “mature” and all structures except fertilized eggs have degenerated.
7.28.260	Most reproduction occurs by cross-fertilization.
7.28.261	The proglottid detaches from the body of the worm and is released into the feces of the organism.
7.28.262	The eggs are eaten by an intermediate host.
7.28.263	The juvenile worm infects the intermediate host and takes up residence, usually in muscle tissue.
7.28.264	When the muscle tissue is eaten by the primary host, the cycle is completed.
7.28.265	There are several tapeworm parasites of humans that are transmitted by eating uncooked or poorly cooked pork, beef, and fish.
7.28.266	Tapeworm (Taenia spp.)
7.28.267	infections occur when humans consume raw or undercooked infected meat.
7.28.268	Phylum Rotifera
7.28.269	The rotifers are a microscopic (about 100 μm to 30 mm) group of mostly aquatic organisms that get their name from the corona, a rotating, wheel-like structure that is covered with cilia at their anterior end (Figure 28.16).
7.28.270	Although their taxonomy is currently in flux, one treatment places the rotifers in three classes: Bdelloidea, Monogononta, and Seisonidea.
7.28.271	The classification of the group is currently under revision, however, as more phylogenetic evidence becomes available.
7.28.272	It is possible that the “spiny headed worms” currently in phylum Acanthocephala will be incorporated into this group in the future.
7.28.273	The body form of rotifers consists of a head (which contains the corona), a trunk (which contains the organs), and the foot.
7.28.274	Rotifers are typically free-swimming and truly planktonic organisms, but the toes or extensions of the foot can secrete a sticky material forming a holdfast to help them adhere to surfaces.
7.28.275	The head contains sensory organs in the form of a bilobed brain and small eyespots near the corona.
7.28.276	Shown are examples from two of the three classes of rotifer.
7.28.277	(a) Species from the class Bdelloidea are characterized by a large corona, shown separately from the whole animals in the center of this scanning electron micrograph.
7.28.278	(b) Polyarthra, from the class Monogononta, has a smaller corona than Bdelloid rotifers, and a single gonad, which give the class its name.
7.28.279	The rotifers are filter feeders that will eat dead material, algae, and other microscopic living organisms, and are therefore very important components of aquatic food webs.
7.28.280	Rotifers obtain food that is directed toward the mouth by the current created from the movement of the corona.
7.28.281	The food particles enter the mouth and travel to the mastax (pharynx with jawlike structures).
7.28.282	Food then passes by digestive and salivary glands, and into the stomach, then onto the intestines.
7.28.283	Digestive and excretory wastes are collected in a cloacal bladder before being released out the anus.
7.28.284	Rotifers are pseudocoelomates commonly found in fresh water and some salt water environments throughout the world.
7.28.285	Figure 28.17 shows the anatomy of a rotifer belonging to class Bdelloidea.
7.28.286	About 2,200 species of rotifers have been identified.
7.28.287	Rotifers are dioecious organisms (having either male or female genitalia) and exhibit sexual dimorphism (males and females have different forms).
7.28.288	Many species are parthenogenic and exhibit haplodiploidy, a method of gender determination in which a fertilized egg develops into a female and an unfertilized egg develops into a male.
7.28.289	In many dioecious species, males are short-lived and smaller with no digestive system and a single testis.
7.28.290	Females can produce eggs that are capable of dormancy for protection during harsh environmental conditions.
7.28.291	This illustration shows the anatomy of a bdelloid rotifer.
7.28.292	Phylum Nemertea
7.28.293	The Nemertea are colloquially known as ribbon worms.
7.28.294	Most species of phylum Nemertea are marine, predominantly benthic or bottom dwellers, with an estimated 900 species known.
7.28.295	However, nemertini have been recorded in freshwater and terrestrial habitats as well.
7.28.296	Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on worms, clams, and crustaceans.
7.28.297	Some species are scavengers, and some nemertini species, like Malacobdella grossa, have also evolved commensalistic relationships with some mollusks.
7.28.298	Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs.
7.28.299	Nemerteans have almost no predators and two species are sold as fish bait.
7.28.300	Morphology Ribbon worms vary in size from 1 cm to several meters.
7.28.301	They show bilateral symmetry and remarkable contractile properties.
7.28.302	Because of their contractility, they can change their morphological presentation in response to environmental cues.
7.28.303	Animals in phylum
7.28.304	Nemertea show a flattened morphology, that is, they are flat from front to back, like a flattened tube.
7.28.305	Nemertea are soft and unsegmented animals.
7.28.306	The proboscis worm (Parborlasia corrugatus) is a scavenger that combs the sea floor for food.
7.28.307	The species is a member of the phylum Nemertea.
7.28.308	The specimen shown here was photographed in the Ross Sea, Antarctica.
7.28.309	A unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of a proboscis enclosed in a rhynchocoel.
7.28.310	The proboscis serves to capture food and may be ornamented with barbs in some species.
7.28.311	The rhynchocoel is a fluid-filled cavity that extends from the head to nearly two-thirds of the length of the gut in these animals (Figure 28.19).
7.28.312	The proboscis may be extended or retracted by the retractor muscle attached to the wall of the rhynchocoel.
7.28.313	Digestive System
7.28.314	The nemertini show a very well-developed digestive system.
7.28.315	A mouth opening that is ventral to the rhynchocoel leads into the foregut, followed by the intestine.
7.28.316	The intestine is present in the form of diverticular pouches and ends in a rectum that opens via an anus.
7.28.317	Gonads are interspersed with the intestinal diverticular pouches and open outwards via genital pores.
7.28.318	A circulatory system consists of a closed loop of a pair of lateral blood vessels.
7.28.319	The circulatory system is derived from the coelomic cavity of the embryo.
7.28.320	Some animals may also have cross-connecting vessels in addition to lateral ones.
7.28.321	Although these are called blood vessels, since they are of coelomic origin, the circulatory fluid is colorless.
7.28.322	Some species bear hemoglobin as well as other yellow or green pigments.
7.28.323	The blood vessels are connected to the rhynchocoel.
7.28.324	The flow of fluid in these vessels is facilitated by the contraction of muscles in the body wall.
7.28.325	A pair of protonephridia, or primitive kidneys, is present in these animals to facilitate osmoregulation.
7.28.326	Gaseous exchange occurs through the skin in the nemertini.
7.28.327	Nervous System Nemertini have a ganglion or “brain” situated at the anterior end between the mouth and the foregut, surrounding the digestive system as well as the rhynchocoel.
7.28.328	A ring of four nerve masses called “ganglia” composes the brain in these animals.
7.28.329	Paired longitudinal nerve cords emerge from the brain ganglia and extend to the posterior end.
7.28.330	Ocelli or eyespots are present in pairs, in multiples of two in the anterior portion of the body.
7.28.331	It is speculated that the eyespots originate from neural tissue and not from the epidermis.
7.28.332	Reproduction Animals in phylum Nemertea show sexual dimorphism, although freshwater species may be hermaphroditic.
7.28.333	Eggs and sperm are released into the water, and fertilization occurs externally.
7.28.334	The zygote then develops into a planuliform larva.
7.28.335	In some nemertine species, a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm, from a series of imaginal discs.
7.28.336	This larval form, characteristically shaped like a deerstalker cap, devours tissues from the young worm for survival before metamorphosing into the adult-like morphology.
7.28.337	Phylum Mollusca Phylum Mollusca is the predominant phylum in marine environments.
7.28.338	It is estimated that 23 percent of all known marine species are mollusks; there are over 75,000 described species, making them the second most diverse phylum of animals.
7.28.339	The name “mollusca”
7.28.340	signifies a soft body, since the earliest descriptions of mollusks came from observations of unshelled cuttlefish.
7.28.341	Mollusks are predominantly a marine group of animals; however, they are known to inhabit freshwater as well as terrestrial habitats.
7.28.342	Mollusks display a wide range of morphologies in each class and subclass, but share a few key characteristics, including a muscular foot, a visceral mass containing internal organs, and a mantle that may or may not secrete a shell of calcium carbonate.
7.28.343	Mollusks have a muscular foot, which is used for locomotion and anchorage, and varies in shape and function, depending on the type of mollusk under study.
7.28.344	In shelled mollusks, this foot is usually the same size as the opening of the shell.
7.28.345	The foot is a retractable as well as an extendable organ.
7.28.346	The foot is the ventral-most organ, whereas the mantle is the limiting dorsal organ.
7.28.347	Mollusks are eucoelomate, but the coelomic cavity is restricted to a cavity around the heart in adult animals.
7.28.348	The mantle cavity develops independently of the coelomic cavity.
7.28.349	The visceral mass is present above the foot, in the visceral hump.
7.28.350	This includes digestive, nervous, excretory, reproductive, and respiratory systems.
7.28.351	Mollusk species that are exclusively aquatic have gills for respiration, whereas some terrestrial species have lungs for respiration.
7.28.352	Additionally, a tongue-like organ called a radula, which bears chitinous tooth-like ornamentation, is present in many species, and serves to shred or scrape food.
7.28.353	The mantle (also known as the pallium) is the dorsal epidermis in mollusks; shelled mollusks are specialized to secrete a chitinous and hard calcareous shell.
7.28.354	Most mollusks are dioecious animals and fertilization occurs externally, although this is not the case in terrestrial mollusks, such as snails and slugs, or in cephalopods.
7.28.355	In some mollusks, the zygote hatches and undergoes two larval stages— trochophore and veliger—before becoming a young adult; bivalves may exhibit a third larval stage, glochidia.
7.28.356	Classification of Phylum Mollusca Phylum Mollusca is a very diverse (85,000 species) group of mostly marine species.
7.28.357	Mollusks have a dramatic variety of form, ranging from large predatory squids and octopus, some of which show a high degree of intelligence, to grazing forms with elaborately sculpted and colored shells.
7.28.358	This phylum can be segregated into seven classes: Aplacophora, Monoplacophora, Polyplacophora, Bivalvia, Gastropoda, Cephalopoda, and Scaphopoda.
7.28.359	Class Aplacophora
7.28.360	(“bearing no plates”) includes worm-like animals primarily found in benthic marine habitats.
7.28.361	These animals lack a calcareous shell but possess aragonite spicules on their epidermis.
7.28.362	They have a rudimentary mantle cavity and lack eyes, tentacles, and nephridia (excretory organs).
7.28.363	Members of class Monoplacophora (“bearing one plate”) posses a single, cap-like shell that encloses the body.
7.28.364	The morphology of the shell and the underlying animal can vary from circular to ovate.
7.28.365	A looped digestive system, multiple pairs of excretory organs, many gills, and a pair of gonads are present in these animals.
7.28.366	The monoplacophorans were believed extinct and only known via fossil records until the discovery of Neopilina galathaea in 1952.
7.28.367	Today, scientists have identified nearly two dozen extant species.
7.28.368	Animals in the class Polyplacophora (“bearing many plates”) are commonly known as “chitons” and bear an armor-like eight-plated shell (Figure 28.21).
7.28.369	These animals have a broad, ventral foot that is adapted for suction to rocks and other substrates, and a mantle that extends beyond the shell in the form of a girdle.
7.28.370	Calcareous spines may be present on the girdle to offer protection from predators.
7.28.371	Respiration is facilitated by ctenidia (gills) that are present ventrally.
7.28.372	These animals possess a radula that is modified for scraping.
7.28.373	The nervous system is rudimentary with only buccal or “cheek” ganglia present at the anterior end.
7.28.374	Eyespots are absent in these animals.
7.28.375	A single pair of nephridia for excretion is present.
7.28.376	This chiton from the class Polyplacaphora has the eight-plated shell that is indicative of its class.
7.28.377	Class Bivalvia (“two shells”) includes clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, and geoducks.
7.28.378	Members of this class are found in marine as well as freshwater habitats.
7.28.379	As the name suggests, bivalves are enclosed in a pair of shells (valves are commonly called “shells”) that are hinged at the dorsal end by shell ligaments as well as shell teeth (Figure 28.22).
7.28.380	The overall morphology is laterally flattened, and the head region is poorly developed.
7.28.381	Eyespots and statocysts may be absent in some species.
7.28.382	Since these animals are suspension feeders, a radula is absent in this class of mollusks.
7.28.383	Respiration is facilitated by a pair of ctenidia, whereas excretion and osmoregulation are brought about by a pair of nephridia.
7.28.384	Bivalves often possess a large mantle cavity.
7.28.385	In some species, the posterior edges of the mantle may fuse to form two siphons that serve to take in and exude water.
7.28.386	These mussels, found in the intertidal zone in Cornwall, England, are bivalves.
7.28.387	One of the functions of the mantle is to secrete the shell.
7.28.388	Some bivalves like oysters and mussels possess the unique ability to secrete and deposit a calcareous nacre or “mother of pearl” around foreign particles that may enter the mantle cavity.
7.28.389	This property has been commercially exploited to produce pearls.
7.28.390	Animals in class Gastropoda
7.28.391	(“stomach foot”) include well-known mollusks like snails, slugs, conchs, sea hares, and sea butterflies.
7.28.392	Gastropoda includes shell-bearing species as well as species with a reduced shell.
7.28.393	These animals are asymmetrical and usually present a coiled shell (Figure 28.23).
7.28.394	Shells may be planospiral (like a garden hose wound up), commonly seen in garden snails, or conispiral, (like a spiral staircase), commonly seen in marine conches.
7.28.395	Snails and (b) slugs are both gastropods, but slugs lack a shell.
7.28.396	The visceral mass in the shelled species displays torsion around the perpendicular axis on the center of the foot, which is the key characteristic of this group, along with a foot that is modified for crawling (Figure 28.24).
7.28.397	Most gastropods bear a head with tentacles, eyes, and a style.
7.28.398	A complex radula is used by the digestive system and aids in the ingestion of food.
7.28.399	Eyes may be absent in some gastropods species.
7.28.400	The mantle cavity encloses the ctenidia as well as a pair of nephridia.
7.28.401	During embryonic development of gastropods, the visceral mass undergoes torsion, or counterclockwise rotation of anatomical features.
7.28.402	As a result, the anus of the adult animal is located over the head.
7.28.403	Torsion is an independent process from coiling of the shell.
7.28.404	Class Cephalopoda
7.28.405	(“head foot” animals), include octopi, squids, cuttlefish, and nautilus.
7.28.406	Cephalopods are a class of shellbearing animals as well as mollusks with a reduced shell.
7.28.407	They display vivid coloration, typically seen in squids and octopi, which is used for camouflage.
7.28.408	All animals in this class are carnivorous predators and have beak-like jaws at the anterior end.
7.28.409	All cephalopods show the presence of a very well-developed nervous system along with eyes, as well as a closed circulatory system.
7.28.410	The foot is lobed and developed into tentacles, and a funnel, which is used as their mode of locomotion.
7.28.411	Suckers are present on the tentacles in octopi and squid.
7.28.412	Ctenidia are enclosed in a large mantle cavity and are serviced by large blood vessels, each with its own heart associated with it; the mantle has siphonophores that facilitate exchange of water.
7.28.413	Locomotion in cephalopods is facilitated by ejecting a stream of water for propulsion.
7.28.414	This is called “jet” propulsion.
7.28.415	A pair of nephridia is present within the mantle cavity.
7.28.416	Sexual dimorphism is seen in this class of animals.
7.28.417	Members of a species mate, and the female then lays the eggs in a secluded and protected niche.
7.28.418	Females of some species care for the eggs for an extended period of time and may end up dying during that time period.
7.28.419	Cephalopods such as squids and octopi also produce sepia or a dark ink, which is squirted upon a predator to assist in a quick getaway.
7.28.420	Reproduction in cephalopods is different from other mollusks in that the egg hatches to produce a juvenile adult without undergoing the trochophore and veliger larval stages.
7.28.421	In the shell-bearing Nautilus spp.
7.28.422	, the spiral shell is multi-chambered.
7.28.423	These chambers are filled with gas or water to regulate buoyancy.
7.28.424	The shell structure in squids and cuttlefish is reduced and is present internally in the form of a squid pen and cuttlefish bone, respectively.
7.28.425	Examples are shown in Figure 28.26.
7.28.426	The (a) nautilus, (b) giant cuttlefish, (c) reef squid, and (d) blue-ring octopus are all members of the class Cephalopoda.
7.28.427	Members of class Scaphopoda
7.28.428	(“boat feet”) are known colloquially as “tusk shells” or “tooth shells,” as evident when examining Dentalium, one of the few remaining scaphopod genera (Figure 28.27).
7.28.429	Scaphopods are usually buried in sand with the anterior opening exposed to water.
7.28.430	These animals bear a single conical shell, which has both ends open.
7.28.431	The head is rudimentary and protrudes out of the posterior end of the shell.
7.28.432	These animals do not possess eyes, but they have a radula, as well as a foot modified into tentacles with a bulbous end, known as captaculae.
7.28.433	Captaculae serve to catch and manipulate prey.
7.28.434	Ctenidia are absent in these animals.
7.28.435	Antalis vulgaris shows the classic Dentaliidae shape that gives these animals their common name of "tusk shell.
7.28.436	" Phylum Annelida Phylum Annelida includes segmented worms.
7.28.437	These animals are found in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater habitats, but a presence of water or humidity is a critical factor for their survival, especially in terrestrial habitats.
7.28.438	The name of the phylum is derived from the Latin word annellus, which means a small ring.
7.28.439	Animals in this phylum show parasitic and commensal symbioses with other species in their habitat.
7.28.440	Approximately 16,500 species have been described in phylum Annelida.
7.28.441	The phylum includes earthworms, polychaete worms, and leeches.
7.28.442	Annelids show protostomic development in embryonic stages and are often called “segmented worms” due to their key characteristic of metamerism, or true segmentation.
7.28.443	Morphology Annelids display bilateral symmetry and are worm-like in overall morphology.
7.28.444	Annelids have a segmented body plan wherein the internal and external morphological features are repeated in each body segment.
7.28.445	Metamerism allows animals to become bigger by adding “compartments” while making their movement more efficient.
7.28.446	This metamerism is thought to arise from identical teloblast cells in the embryonic stage, which give rise to identical mesodermal structures.
7.28.447	The overall body can be divided into head, body, and pygidium (or tail).
7.28.448	The clitellum is a reproductive structure that generates mucus that aids in sperm transfer and gives rise to a cocoon within which fertilization occurs; it appears as a fused band in the anterior third of the animal.
7.28.449	The clitellum, seen here as a protruding segment with different coloration than the rest of the body, is a structure that aids in annelid reproduction.
7.28.450	Hence, they are the most advanced worms.
7.28.451	A well-developed and complete digestive system is present in earthworms (oligochaetes) with a mouth, muscular pharynx, esophagus, crop, and gizzard being present.
7.28.452	The gizzard leads to the intestine and ends in an anal opening.
7.28.453	A cross-sectional view of a body segment of an earthworm (a terrestrial type of annelid) is shown in Figure 28.29; each segment is limited by a membranous septum that divides the coelomic cavity into a series of compartments.
7.28.454	Annelids possess a closed circulatory system of dorsal and ventral blood vessels that run parallel to the alimentary canal as well as capillaries that service individual tissues.
7.28.455	In addition, these vessels are connected by transverse loops in every segment.
7.28.456	These animals lack a well-developed respiratory system, and gas exchange occurs across the moist body surface.
7.28.457	Excretion is facilitated by a pair of metanephridia (a type of primitive “kidney” that consists of a convoluted tubule and an open, ciliated funnel) that is present in every segment towards the ventral side.
7.28.458	Annelids show well-developed nervous systems with a nerve ring of fused ganglia present around the pharynx.
7.28.459	The nerve cord is ventral in position and bears enlarged nodes or ganglia in each segment.
7.28.460	This schematic drawing shows the basic anatomy of annelids in a cross-sectional view.
7.28.461	Annelids may be either monoecious with permanent gonads (as in earthworms and leeches) or dioecious with temporary or seasonal gonads that develop (as in polychaetes).
7.28.462	However, cross-fertilization is preferred in hermaphroditic animals.
7.28.463	These animals may also show simultaneous hermaphroditism and participate in simultaneous sperm exchange when they are aligned for copulation.
7.28.464	Classification of Phylum Annelida Phylum Annelida contains the class Polychaeta (the polychaetes) and the class Oligochaeta (the earthworms, leeches and their relatives).
7.28.465	Earthworms are the most abundant members of the class Oligochaeta, distinguished by the presence of the clitellum as well as few, reduced chaetae (“
7.28.466	oligo- =
7.28.467	“few”; -chaetae =
7.28.468	“hairs”).
7.28.469	The number and size of chaetae are greatly diminished in Oligochaeta compared to the polychaetes (poly=many, chaetae = hairs).
7.28.470	The many chetae of polychaetes are also arranged within fleshy, flat, paired appendages that protrude from each segment called parapodia, which may be specialized for different functions in the polychates.
7.28.471	The subclass Hirudinea includes leeches such as Hirudo medicinalis and Hemiclepsis marginata.
7.28.472	The class Oligochaeta includes the subclass Hirudinia and the subclass Brachiobdella.
7.28.473	A significant difference between leeches and other annelids is the development of suckers at the anterior and posterior ends and a lack of chaetae.
7.28.474	Additionally, the segmentation of the body wall may not correspond to the internal segmentation of the coelomic cavity.
7.28.475	This adaptation possibly helps the leeches to elongate when they ingest copious quantities of blood from host vertebrates.
7.28.476	The subclass Brachiobdella includes species like Branchiobdella balcanica sketi and Branchiobdella astaci, worms that show similarity with leeches as well as oligochaetes.
7.28.477	The (a) earthworm, (b) leech, and (c) featherduster are all annelids.
7.28.478	Superphylum Ecdysozoa
7.28.479	The superphylum Ecdysozoa contains an incredibly large number of species.
7.28.480	This is because it contains two of the most diverse animal groups: phylum Nematoda (the roundworms) and Phylum Arthropoda (the arthropods).
7.28.481	The most prominant distinguising feature of Ecdysozoans is their tough external covering called the cuticle.
7.28.482	The cuticle provides a tough, but flexible exoskeleton tht protects these animals from water loss, predators and other aspects of the external environment.
7.28.483	All members of this superphylum periodically molt, or shed their cuticle as they grow.
7.28.484	After molting, they secrete a new cuticle that will last until their next growth phase.
7.28.485	The process of molting and replacing the cuticle is called ecdysis, which is how the superphylum derived its name.
7.28.486	Phylum Nematoda
7.28.487	The Nematoda, like most other animal phyla, are triploblastic and possess an embryonic mesoderm that is sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm.
7.28.488	They are also bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section will divide them into right and left sides that are symmetrical.
7.28.489	Furthermore, the nematodes, or roundworms, possess a pseudocoelom and consist of both free-living and parasitic forms.
7.28.490	It has been said that were all the non-nematode matter of the biosphere removed, there would remain a shadow of the former world in the form of nematodes.
7.28.491	[1]
7.28.492	The arthropods, one of the most successful taxonomic groups on the planet, are coelomate organisms characterized by a hard exoskeleton and jointed appendages.
7.28.493	Both the nematodes and arthropods belong to the superphylum Ecdysozoa that is believed to be a clade consisting of all evolutionary descendants from one common ancestor.
7.28.494	The name derives from the word ecdysis, which refers to the shedding, or molting, of the exoskeleton.
7.28.495	The phyla in this group have a hard cuticle that covers their bodies, which must be periodically shed and replaced for them to increase in size.
7.28.496	Phylum Nematoda includes more than 28,000 species with an estimated 16,000 being parasitic in nature.
7.28.497	The name Nematoda is derived from the Greek word “Nemos,” which means “thread” and includes roundworms.
7.28.498	Nematodes are present in all habitats with a large number of individuals of each species present in each.
7.28.499	The free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans has been extensively used as a model system in laboratories all over the world.
7.28.500	Morphology
7.28.501	In contrast with cnidarians, nematodes show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section.
7.28.502	These animals are pseudocoelomates and show the presence of a complete digestive system with a distinct mouth and anus.
7.28.503	This is in contrast with the cnidarians, where only one opening is present (an incomplete digestive system).
7.28.504	The cuticle of Nematodes is rich in collagen and a carbohydrate-protein polymer called chitin, and forms an external “skeleton” outside the epidermis.
7.28.505	The cuticle also lines many of the organs internally, including the pharynx and rectum.
7.28.506	The epidermis can be either a single layer of cells or a syncytium, which is a multinucleated cell formed from the fusion of uninucleated cells.
7.28.507	The overall morphology of these worms is cylindrical, as seen in Figure 28.31.
7.28.508	The head is radially symmetrical.
7.28.509	A mouth opening is present at the anterior end with three or six lips as well as teeth in some species in the form of cuticle extensions.
7.28.510	Some nematodes may present other external modifications like rings, head shields, or warts.
7.28.511	Rings, however, do not reflect true internal body segmentation.
7.28.512	The mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and intestine, which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the posterior end.
7.28.513	The muscles of nematodes differ from those of most animals: They have a longitudinal layer only, which accounts for the whip-like motion of their movement.
7.28.514	Scanning electron micrograph shows (a) the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) and a nematode egg.
7.28.515	(b)
7.28.516	A schematic representation shows the anatomy of a typical nematode.
7.28.517	Excretory System
7.28.518	In nematodes, specialized excretory systems are not well developed.
7.28.519	Nitrogenous wastes may be lost by diffusion through the entire body or into the pseudocoelom (body cavity), where they are removed by specialized cells.
7.28.520	Regulation of water and salt content of the body is achieved by renette glands, present under the pharynx in marine nematodes.
7.28.521	Nervous system
7.28.522	Most nematodes possess four longitudinal nerve cords that run along the length of the body in dorsal, ventral, and lateral positions.
7.28.523	The ventral nerve cord is better developed than the dorsal or lateral cords.
7.28.524	All nerve cords fuse at the anterior end, around the pharynx, to form head ganglia or the “brain” of the worm (which take the form of a ring around the pharynx) as well as at the posterior end to form the tail ganglia.
7.28.525	In C. elegans, the nervous system accounts for nearly one-third of the total number of cells in the animal.
7.28.526	Reproduction Nematodes employ a variety of reproductive strategies that range from monoecious to dioecious to parthenogenic, depending upon the species under consideration.
7.28.527	C. elegans is a monoecious species and shows development of ova contained in a uterus as well as sperm contained in the spermatheca.
7.28.528	The uterus has an external opening known as the vulva.
7.28.529	The female genital pore is near the middle of the body, whereas the male’s is at the tip.
7.28.530	Specialized structures at the tail of the male keep him in place while he deposits sperm with copulatory spicules.
7.28.531	Fertilization is internal, and embryonic development starts very soon after fertilization.
7.28.532	The embryo is released from the vulva during the gastrulation stage.
7.28.533	The embryonic development stage lasts for 14 hours; development then continues through four successive larval stages with ecdysis between each stage—L1, L2, L3, and L4—ultimately leading to the development of a young male or female adult worm.
7.28.534	Adverse environmental conditions like overcrowding and lack of food can result in the formation of an intermediate larval stage known as the dauer larva.
7.28.535	A number of common parasitic nematodes serve as prime examples of parasitism.
7.28.536	These animals exhibit complex lifecycles that involve multiple hosts, and they can have significant medical and veterinary impacts.
7.28.537	Humans may become infected by Dracunculus medinensis, known as guinea worms, when they drink unfiltered water containing copepods.
7.28.538	Hookworms, such as Ancyclostoma and Necator, infest the intestines and feed on the blood of mammals, especially in dogs, cats, and humans.
7.28.539	Trichina worms (Trichinella) are the causal organism of trichinosis in humans, often resulting from the consumption of undercooked pork; Trichinella can infect other mammalian hosts as well.
7.28.540	Ascaris, a large intestinal roundworm, steals nutrition from its human host and may create physical blockage of the intestines.
7.28.541	The filarial worms, such as Dirofilaria and Wuchereria, are commonly vectored by mosquitoes, which pass the infective agents among mammals through their blood-sucking activity.
7.28.542	Dirofilaria immitis, a blood-infective parasite, is the notorious dog heartworm species.
7.28.543	Wuchereria bancrofti infects the lymph nodes of humans, resulting in the non-lethal but deforming condition called elephantiasis, in which parts of the body become swelled to gigantic proportions due to obstruction of lymphatic drainage and inflammation of lymphatic tissues.
7.28.544	The guinea worm Dracunculus medinensis infects about 3.5 million people annually, mostly in Africa.
7.28.545	(a) Here, the worm is wrapped around a stick so it can be extracted.
7.28.546	(b) Infection occurs when people consume water contaminated by infected copepods, but this can easily be prevented by simple filtration systems.
7.28.547	Phylum Arthropoda
7.28.548	The name “arthropoda
7.28.549	” means “jointed legs
7.28.550	” (in the Greek, “arthros” means “
7.28.551	joint” and “podos” means “leg”); it aptly describes the enormous number of invertebrates included in this phylum.
7.28.552	Arthropoda dominate the animal kingdom with an estimated 85 percent of known species included in this phylum and many arthropods yet undocumented.
7.28.553	The principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are functional segmentation of the body and presence of jointed appendages.
7.28.554	Arthropods also show the presence of an exoskeleton made principally of chitin, which is a waterproof, tough polysaccharide.
7.28.555	Phylum Arthropoda is the largest phylum in the animal world, and insects form the single largest class within this phylum.
7.28.556	Arthropods are eucoelomate, protostomic organisms.
7.28.557	Phylum Arthropoda includes animals that have been successful in colonizing terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial habitats.
7.28.558	This phylum is further classified into five subphyla: Trilobitomorpha (trilobites, all extinct), Hexapoda (insects and relatives), Myriapoda (millipedes, centipedes, and relatives), Crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, crayfish, isopods, barnacles, and some zooplankton), and Chelicerata (horseshoe crabs, arachnids, scorpions, and daddy longlegs).
7.28.559	Trilobites are an extinct group of arthropods found chiefly in the pre-Cambrian Era that are probably most closely related to the Chelicerata.
7.28.560	These are identified based on fossil records.
7.28.561	Trilobites, like the one in this fossil, are an extinct group of arthropods.
7.28.562	Morphology
7.28.563	A unique feature of animals in the arthropod phylum is the presence of a segmented body and fusion of sets of segments that give rise to functional body regions called tagma.
7.28.564	Tagma may be in the form of a head, thorax, and abdomen, or a cephalothorax and abdomen, or a head and trunk.
7.28.565	A central cavity, called the hemocoel (or blood cavity), is present, and the open circulatory system is regulated by a tubular or single-chambered heart.
7.28.566	Respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod: insects and myriapods use a series of tubes (tracheae) that branch through the body, open to the outside through openings called spiracles, and perform gas exchange directly between the cells and air in the tracheae, whereas aquatic crustaceans utilize gills, terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs, and aquatic chelicerates use book gills (Figure 28.35).
7.28.567	The book lungs of arachnids (scorpions, spiders, ticks and mites) contain a vertical stack of hemocoel wall tissue that somewhat resembles the pages of a book.
7.28.568	Between each of the "pages" of tissue is an air space.
7.28.569	This allows both sides of the tissue to be in contact with the air at all times, greatly increasing the efficiency of gas exchange.
7.28.570	The gills of crustaceans are filamentous structures that exchange gases with the surrounding water.
7.28.571	Groups of arthropods also differ in the organs used for excretion, with crustaceans possessing green glands and insects using Malpighian tubules, which work in conjunction with the hindgut to reabsorb water while ridding the body of nitrogenous waste.
7.28.572	The cuticle is the covering of an arthropod.
7.28.573	It is made up of two layers: the epicuticle, which is a thin, waxy water-resistant outer layer containing no chitin, and the layer beneath it, the chitinous procuticle.
7.28.574	Chitin is a tough, flexible polysaccharide.
7.28.575	In order to grow, the arthropod must shed the exoskeleton during a process called ecdysis (“to strip off”); this is a cumbersome method of growth, and during this time, the animal is vulnerable to predation.
7.28.576	The characteristic morphology of representative animals from each subphylum is described below.
7.28.577	The book lungs of (a) arachnids are made up of alternating air pockets and hemocoel tissue shaped like a stack of books.
7.28.578	The book gills of (b) crustaceans are similar to book lungs but are external so that gas exchange can occur with the surrounding water.
7.28.579	Subphylum Hexapoda
7.28.580	The name Hexapoda denotes the presence of six legs (three pairs) in these animals as differentiated from the number of pairs present in other arthropods.
7.28.581	Hexapods are characterized by the presence of a head, thorax, and abdomen, constituting three tagma.
7.28.582	The thorax bears the wings as well as six legs in three pairs.
7.28.583	Many of the common insects we encounter on a daily basis—including ants, cockroaches, butterflies, and flies—are examples of Hexapoda.
7.28.584	Amongst the hexapods, the insects (Figure 28.36) are the largest class in terms of species diversity as well as biomass in terrestrial habitats.
7.28.585	Typically, the head bears one pair of sensory antennae, mandibles as mouthparts, a pair of compound eyes, and some ocelli (simple eyes) along with numerous sensory hairs.
7.28.586	The thorax bears three pairs of legs (one pair per segment) and two pairs of wings, with one pair each on the second and third thoracic segments.
7.28.587	The abdomen usually has eleven segments and bears reproductive apertures.
7.28.588	Hexapoda includes insects that are winged (like fruit flies) and wingless (like fleas).
7.28.589	Subphylum Myriapoda Subphylum Myriapoda includes arthropods with numerous legs.
7.28.590	Although the name is hyperbolic in suggesting that myriad legs are present in these invertebrates, the number of legs may vary from 10 to 750.
7.28.591	This subphylum includes 13,000 species; the most commonly found examples are millipedes and centipedes.
7.28.592	All myriapods are terrestrial animals and prefer a humid environment.
7.28.593	Myriapods are typically found in moist soils, decaying biological material, and leaf litter.
7.28.594	Subphylum Myriapoda is divided into four classes: Chilopoda, Symphyla, Diplopoda, and Pauropoda.
7.28.595	Centipedes like Scutigera coleoptrata (Figure 28.37) are classified as chilopods.
7.28.596	These animals bear one pair of legs per segment, mandibles as mouthparts, and are somewhat dorsoventrally flattened.
7.28.597	The legs in the first segment are modified to form forcipules (poison claws) that deliver poison to prey like spiders and cockroaches, as these animals are all predatory.
7.28.598	Millipedes bear two pairs of legs per diplosegment, a feature that results from embryonic fusion of adjacent pairs of body segments, are usually rounder in cross-section, and are herbivores or detritivores.
7.28.599	Millipedes have visibly more numbers of legs as compared to centipedes, although they do not bear a thousand legs.
7.28.600	(a)
7.28.601	The Scutigera coleoptrata centipede has up to 15 pairs of legs.
7.28.602	(b)
7.28.603	This North American millipede (Narceus americanus) bears many legs, although not a thousand, as its name might suggest.
7.28.604	Subphylum Crustacea Crustaceans are the most dominant aquatic arthropods, since the total number of marine crustacean species stands at 67,000, but there are also freshwater and terrestrial crustacean species.
7.28.605	Krill, shrimp, lobsters, crabs, and crayfish are examples of crustaceans (Figure 28.38).
7.28.606	Terrestrial species like the wood lice (Armadillidium spp.)
7.28.607	(also called pill bugs, rolly pollies, potato bugs, or isopods) are also crustaceans, although the number of non-aquatic species in this subphylum is relatively low.
7.28.608	The (a) crab and (b) shrimp krill are both crustaceans.
7.28.609	Crustaceans possess two pairs of antennae, mandibles as mouthparts, and biramous (“two branched”) appendages, which means that their legs are formed in two parts, as distinct from the uniramous (“one branched”) myriapods and hexapods.
7.28.610	Arthropods may have (a) biramous (two-branched) appendages or (b) uniramous (one-branched) appendages.
7.28.611	Unlike that of the Hexapoda, the head and thorax of most crustaceans is fused to form a cephalothorax (Figure 28.40), which is covered by a plate called the carapace, thus producing a body structure of two tagma.
7.28.612	Crustaceans have a chitinous exoskeleton that is shed by molting whenever the animal increases in size.
7.28.613	The exoskeletons of many species are also infused with calcium carbonate, which makes them even stronger than in other arthropods.
7.28.614	Crustaceans have an open circulatory system where blood is pumped into the hemocoel by the dorsally located heart.
7.28.615	Hemocyanin and hemoglobin are the respiratory pigments present in these animals.
7.28.616	The crayfish is an example of a crustacean.
7.28.617	It has a carapace around the cephalothorax and the heart in the dorsal thorax area.
7.28.618	Most crustaceans are dioecious, which means that the sexes are separate.
7.28.619	Some species like barnacles may be hermaphrodites.
7.28.620	Serial hermaphroditism, where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova, may also be seen in some species.
7.28.621	Fertilized eggs may be held within the female of the species or may be released in the water.
7.28.622	Terrestrial crustaceans seek out damp spaces in their habitats to lay eggs.
7.28.623	Larval stages— nauplius and zoea—are seen in the early development of crustaceans.
7.28.624	A cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles.
7.28.625	All crustaceans go through different larval stages.
7.28.626	Shown are (a) the nauplius larval stage of a tadpole shrimp, (b) the cypris larval stage of a barnacle, and (c) the zoea larval stage of a green crab.
7.28.627	Crustaceans possess a tripartite brain and two compound eyes.
7.28.628	Most crustaceans are carnivorous, but herbivorous and detritivorous species are also known.
7.28.629	Crustaceans may also be cannibalistic when extremely high populations of these organisms are present.
7.28.630	Subphylum Chelicerata
7.28.631	This subphylum includes animals such as spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, and sea spiders.
7.28.632	This subphylum is predominantly terrestrial, although some marine species also exist.
7.28.633	An estimated 77,000 species are included in subphylum Chelicerata.
7.28.634	Chelicerates are found in almost all habitats.
7.28.635	The body of chelicerates may be divided into two parts: prosoma and opisthosoma, which are basically the equivalents of cephalothorax (usually smaller) and abdomen (usually larger).
7.28.636	A “head” tagmum is not usually discernible.
7.28.637	The phylum derives its name from the first pair of appendages: the chelicerae (Figure 28.42), which are specialized, claw-like or fanglike mouthparts.
7.28.638	These animals do not possess antennae.
7.28.639	The second pair of appendages is known as pedipalps.
7.28.640	In some species, like sea spiders, an additional pair of appendages, called ovigers, is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps.
7.28.641	The chelicerae (first set of appendages) are well developed in the scorpion.
7.28.642	Chelicerae are mostly used for feeding, but in spiders, these are often modified into fangs that inject venom into their prey before feeding (Figure 28.43).
7.28.643	Members of this subphylum have an open circulatory system with a heart that pumps blood into the hemocoel.
7.28.644	Aquatic species have gills, whereas terrestrial species have either trachea or book lungs for gaseous exchange.
7.28.645	The trapdoor spider, like all spiders, is a member of the subphylum Chelicerata.
7.28.646	Most chelicerates ingest food using a preoral cavity formed by the chelicerae and pedipalps.
7.28.647	Some chelicerates may secrete digestive enzymes to pre-digest food before ingesting it.
7.28.648	Parasitic chelicerates like ticks and mites have evolved bloodsucking apparatuses.
7.28.649	The nervous system in chelicerates consists of a brain and two ventral nerve cords.
7.28.650	These animals use external fertilization as well as internal fertilization strategies for reproduction, depending upon the species and its habitat.
7.28.651	Parental care for the young ranges from absolutely none to relatively prolonged care.
7.28.652	The phyla Echinodermata and Chordata (the phylum in which humans are placed) both belong to the superphylum Deuterostomia.
7.28.653	Recall that protostome and deuterostomes
7.28.654	differ in certain aspects of their embryonic development, and they are named based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first.
7.28.655	The word deuterostome comes from the Greek word meaning “mouth second,
7.28.656	” indicating that the anus is the first to develop.
7.28.657	There are a series of other developmental characteristics that differ between protostomes and deuterostomes, including the mode of formation of the coelom and the early cell division of the embryo.
7.28.658	In deuterostomes, internal pockets of the endodermal lining called the archenteron fuse to form the coelom.
7.28.659	The endodermal lining of the archenteron (or the primitive gut) forms membrane protrusions that bud off and become the mesodermal layer.
7.28.660	These buds, known as coelomic pouches, fuse to form the coelomic cavity, as they eventually separate from the endodermal layer.
7.28.661	The resultant coelom is termed an enterocoelom.
7.28.662	The archenteron develops into the alimentary canal, and a mouth opening is formed by invagination of ectoderm at the pole opposite the blastopore of the gastrula.
7.28.663	The blastopore forms the anus of the alimentary system in the juvenile and adult forms.
7.28.664	The fates of embryonic cells in deuterostomes can be altered if they are experimentally moved to a different location in the embryo due to indeterminant cleavage in early embryogenesis.
7.28.665	Phylum Echinodermata Echinodermata are so named owing to their spiny skin (from the Greek “echinos” meaning “spiny
7.28.666	” and “
7.28.667	dermos” meaning “skin”), and this phylum is a collection of about 7,000 described living species.
7.28.668	Echinodermata are exclusively marine organisms.
7.28.669	Sea stars (Figure 28.44), sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms.
7.28.670	To date, no freshwater or terrestrial echinoderms are known.
7.28.671	Morphology and Anatomy Adult echinoderms exhibit pentaradial symmetry and have a calcareous endoskeleton made of ossicles, although the early larval stages of all echinoderms have bilateral symmetry.
7.28.672	The endoskeleton is developed by epidermal cells and may possess pigment cells, giving vivid colors to these animals, as well as cells laden with toxins.
7.28.673	Gonads are present in each arm.
7.28.674	In echinoderms like sea stars, every arm bears two rows of tube feet on the oral side.
7.28.675	These tube feet help in attachment to the substratum.
7.28.676	These animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system.
7.28.677	An interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate, even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost.
7.28.678	This diagram shows the anatomy of a sea star.
7.28.679	Water Vascular System Echinoderms possess a unique ambulacral or water vascular system, consisting of a central ring canal and radial canals that extend along each arm.
7.28.680	Water circulates through these structures and facilitates gaseous exchange as well as nutrition, predation, and locomotion.
7.28.681	The water vascular system also projects from holes in the skeleton in the form of tube feet.
7.28.682	These tube feet can expand or contract based on the volume of water present in the system of that arm.
7.28.683	By using hydrostatic pressure, the animal can either protrude or retract the tube feet.
7.28.684	Water enters the madreporite on the aboral side of the echinoderm.
7.28.685	From there, it passes into the stone canal, which moves water into the ring canal.
7.28.686	The ring canal connects the radial canals (there are five in a pentaradial animal), and the radial canals move water into the ampullae, which have tube feet through which the water moves.
7.28.687	By moving water through the unique water vascular system, the echinoderm can move and force open mollusk shells during feeding.
7.28.688	Nervous System
7.28.689	The nervous system in these animals is a relatively simple structure with a nerve ring at the center and five radial nerves extending outward along the arms.
7.28.690	Structures analogous to a brain or derived from fusion of ganglia are not present in these animals.
7.28.691	Excretory System Podocytes, cells specialized for ultrafiltration of bodily fluids, are present near the center of echinoderms.
7.28.692	These podocytes are connected by an internal system of canals to an opening called the madreporite.
7.28.693	Reproduction Echinoderms are sexually dimorphic and release their eggs and sperm cells into water; fertilization is external.
7.28.694	In some species, the larvae divide asexually and multiply before they reach sexual maturity.
7.28.695	Echinoderms may also reproduce asexually, as well as regenerate body parts lost in trauma.
7.28.696	Classes of Echinoderms
7.28.697	This phylum is divided into five extant classes: Asteroidea (sea stars), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), Echinoidea (sea urchins and sand dollars), Crinoidea (sea lilies or feather stars), and Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers) (Figure 28.45).
7.28.698	The most well-known echinoderms are members of class Asteroidea, or sea stars.
7.28.699	They come in a large variety of shapes, colors, and sizes, with more than 1,800 species known so far.
7.28.700	The key characteristic of sea stars that distinguishes them from other echinoderm classes includes thick arms (ambulacra) that extend from a central disk where organs penetrate into the arms.
7.28.701	Sea stars use their tube feet not only for gripping surfaces but also for grasping prey.
7.28.702	Sea stars have two stomachs, one of which can protrude through their mouths and secrete digestive juices into or onto prey, even before ingestion.
7.28.703	This process can essentially liquefy the prey and make digestion easier.
7.28.704	Brittle stars belong to the class Ophiuroidea.
7.28.705	Unlike sea stars, which have plump arms, brittle stars have long, thin arms that are sharply demarcated from the central disk.
7.28.706	Brittle stars move by lashing out their arms or wrapping them around objects and pulling themselves forward.
7.28.707	Sea urchins and sand dollars are examples of Echinoidea.
7.28.708	These echinoderms do not have arms, but are hemispherical or flattened with five rows of tube feet that help them in slow movement; tube feet are extruded through pores of a continuous internal shell called a test.
7.28.709	Sea lilies and feather stars are examples of Crinoidea.
7.28.710	Both of these species are suspension feeders.
7.28.711	Sea cucumbers of class Holothuroidea are extended in the oral-aboral axis and have five rows of tube feet.
7.28.712	These are the only echinoderms that demonstrate “functional” bilateral symmetry as adults, because the uniquely extended oral-aboral axis compels the animal to lie horizontally rather than stand vertically.
7.28.713	Different members of Echinodermata include the (a) sea star of class Asteroidea, (b) the brittle star of class Ophiuroidea, (c) the sea urchins of class Echinoidea, (d) the sea lilies belonging to class Crinoidea, and (e) sea cucumbers, representing class Holothuroidea.
7.28.714	Phylum Chordata Animals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail.
7.28.715	In some groups, some of these traits are present only during embryonic development.
7.28.716	In addition to containing vertebrate classes, the phylum Chordata contains two clades of invertebrates: Urochordata (tunicates) and Cephalochordata (lancelets).
7.28.717	Most tunicates live on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders.
7.28.718	Lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on phytoplankton and other microorganisms.
7.29.0	Examples of critically endangered vertebrate species include (a) the Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris), (b) the mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei), and (c) the Philippine eagle (Pithecophega jefferyi).
7.29.1	Vertebrates are among the most recognizable organisms of the animal kingdom.
7.29.2	More than 62,000 vertebrate species have been identified.
7.29.3	The vertebrate species now living represent only a small portion of the vertebrates that have existed.
7.29.4	The best-known extinct vertebrates are the dinosaurs, a unique group of reptiles, which reached sizes not seen before or after in terrestrial animals.
7.29.5	They were the dominant terrestrial animals for 150 million years, until they died out in a mass extinction near the end of the Cretaceous period.
7.29.6	Although it is not known with certainty what caused their extinction, a great deal is known about the anatomy of the dinosaurs, given the preservation of skeletal elements in the fossil record.
7.29.7	Currently, a number of vertebrate species face extinction primarily due to habitat loss and pollution.
7.29.8	According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, more than 6,000 vertebrate species are classified as threatened.
7.29.9	Amphibians and mammals are the classes with the greatest percentage of threatened species, with 29 percent of all amphibians and 21 percent of all mammals classified as threatened.
7.29.10	Attempts are being made around the world to prevent the extinction of threatened species.
7.29.11	For example, the Biodiversity Action Plan is an international program, ratified by 188 countries, which is designed to protect species and habitats.
7.29.12	Vertebrates are members of the kingdom Animalia and the phylum Chordata (Figure 29.2).
7.29.13	Recall that animals that possess bilateral symmetry can be divided into two groups—protostomes and deuterostomes—based on their patterns of embryonic development.
7.29.14	The deuterostomes, whose name translates as “second mouth,” consist of two phyla: Chordata and Echinodermata.
7.29.15	Echinoderms are invertebrate marine animals that have pentaradial symmetry and a spiny body covering, a group that includes sea stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.
7.29.16	The most conspicuous and familiar members of Chordata are vertebrates, but this phylum also includes two groups of invertebrate chordates.
7.29.17	Characteristics of Chordata Animals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage during their development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail (Figure 29.3).
7.29.18	In some groups, some of these are present only during embryonic development.
7.29.19	The chordates are named for the notochord, which is a flexible, rod-shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species.
7.29.20	It is located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord, and provides skeletal support through the length of the body.
7.29.21	In some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal’s lifetime.
7.29.22	In vertebrates, the notochord is present during embryonic development, at which time it induces the development of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body.
7.29.23	The notochord, however, is not found in the postnatal stage of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the vertebral column (that is, the spine).
7.29.24	The dorsal hollow nerve cord derives from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development.
7.29.25	In chordates, it is located dorsal to the notochord.
7.29.26	In contrast, other animal phyla are characterized by solid nerve cords that are located either ventrally or laterally.
7.29.27	The nerve cord found in most chordate embryos develops into the brain and spinal cord, which compose the central nervous system.
7.29.28	Pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx (the region just posterior to the mouth) that extend to the outside environment.
7.29.29	In organisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding.
7.29.30	Some invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food out of the water that enters the mouth.
7.29.31	In vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, into jaw supports.
7.29.32	In tetrapods, the slits are modified into components of the ear and tonsils.
7.29.33	Tetrapod literally means “four-footed,” which refers to the phylogenetic history of various groups that evolved accordingly, even though some now possess fewer than two pairs of walking appendages.
7.29.34	Tetrapods include amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
7.29.35	The post-anal tail is a posterior elongation of the body, extending beyond the anus.
7.29.36	The tail contains skeletal elements and muscles, which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species, such as fishes.
7.29.37	In some terrestrial vertebrates, the tail also helps with balance, courting, and signaling when danger is near.
7.29.38	In humans, the post-anal tail is vestigial, that is, reduced in size and nonfunctional.
7.29.39	Chordates and the Evolution of Vertebrates Chordata also contains two clades of invertebrates: Urochordata and Cephalochordata.
7.29.40	Members of these groups also possess the four distinctive features of chordates at some point during their development.
7.29.41	Urochordata Members of Urochordata are also known as tunicates (Figure 29.4).
7.29.42	The name tunicate derives from the cellulose-like carbohydrate material, called the tunic, which covers the outer body of tunicates.
7.29.43	Although adult tunicates are classified as chordates, they do not have a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, or a post-anal tail, although they do have pharyngeal slits.
7.29.44	The larval form, however, possesses all four structures.
7.29.45	Most tunicates are hermaphrodites.
7.29.46	Tunicate larvae hatch from eggs inside the adult tunicate’s body.
7.29.47	After hatching, a tunicate larva swims for a few days until it finds a suitable surface on which it can attach, usually in a dark or shaded location.
7.29.48	It then attaches via the head to the surface and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form, at which point the notochord, nerve cord, and tail disappear.
7.29.49	This photograph shows a colony of the tunicate Botrylloides violaceus.
7.29.50	(b)
7.29.51	The larval stage of the tunicate possesses all of the features characteristic of chordates: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail.
7.29.52	(c)
7.29.53	In the adult stage, the notochord, nerve cord, and tail disappear.
7.29.54	Most tunicates live a sessile existence on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders.
7.29.55	The primary foods of tunicates are plankton and detritus.
7.29.56	Seawater enters the tunicate’s body through its incurrent siphon.
7.29.57	Suspended material is filtered out of this water by a mucous net (pharyngeal slits) and is passed into the intestine via the action of cilia.
7.29.58	The anus empties into the excurrent siphon, which expels wastes and water.
7.29.59	Tunicates are found in shallow ocean waters around the world.
7.29.60	Cephalochordata Members of Cephalochordata possess a notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail in the adult stage (Figure 29.5).
7.29.61	The notochord extends into the head, which gives the subphylum its name.
7.29.62	Extinct members of this subphylum include Pikaia, which is the oldest known cephalochordate.
7.29.63	Pikaia fossils were recovered from the Burgess shales of Canada and dated to the middle of the Cambrian age, making them more than 500 million years old.
7.29.64	Extant members of Cephalochordata are the lancelets, named for their blade-like shape.
7.29.65	Lancelets are only a few centimeters long and are usually found buried in sand at the bottom of warm temperate and tropical seas.
7.29.66	Like tunicates, they are suspension feeders.
7.29.67	The lancelet, like all cephalochordates, has a head.
7.29.68	Adult lancelets retain the four key features of chordates: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail.
7.29.69	Water from the mouth enters the pharyngeal slits, which filter out food particles.
7.29.70	The filtered water then collects in the atrium and exits through the atriopore.
7.29.71	Craniata and Vertebrata A cranium is a bony, cartilaginous, or fibrous structure surrounding the brain, jaw, and facial bones (Figure 29.6).
7.29.72	Most bilaterally symmetrical animals have a head; of these, those that have a cranium compose the clade Craniata.
7.29.73	Craniata includes the hagfishes (Myxini), which have a cranium but lack a backbone, and all of the organisms called “vertebrates.
7.29.74	” Craniata, including this fish (Dunkleosteus sp.), are characterized by the presence of a cranium, mandible, and other facial bones.
7.29.75	Vertebrates are members of the clade Vertebrata.
7.29.76	Vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates; however, members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates.
7.29.77	Vertebrata is named for the vertebral column, composed of vertebrae, a series of separate bones joined together as a backbone (Figure 29.7).
7.29.78	In adult vertebrates, the vertebral column replaces the notochord, which is only seen in the embryonic stage.
7.29.79	Vertebrata are characterized by the presence of a backbone, such as the one that runs through the middle of this fish.
7.29.80	All vertebrates are in the Craniata clade and have a cranium.
7.29.81	Based on molecular analysis, vertebrates appear to be more closely related to lancelets (cephalochordates) than to tunicates (urochordates) among the invertebrate chordates.
7.29.82	This evidence suggests that the cephalochordates diverged from Urochordata and the vertebrates subsequently diverged from the cephalochordates.
7.29.83	This hypothesis is further supported by the discovery of a fossil in China from the genus Haikouella.
7.29.84	This organism seems to be an intermediate form between cephalochordates and vertebrates.
7.29.85	The Haikouella fossils are about 530 million years old and appear similar to modern lancelets.
7.29.86	These organisms had a brain and eyes, as do vertebrates, but lack the skull found in craniates.
7.29.87	[1]
7.29.88	This evidence suggests that vertebrates arose during the Cambrian explosion.
7.29.89	Recall that the “Cambrian explosion” is the name given to a relatively brief span of time during the Cambrian period during which many animal groups appeared and rapidly diversified.
7.29.90	Most modern animal phyla originated during the Cambrian explosion.
7.29.91	Vertebrates are the largest group of chordates, with more than 62,000 living species.
7.29.92	Vertebrates are grouped based on anatomical and physiological traits.
7.29.93	More than one classification and naming scheme is used for these animals.
7.29.94	Here we will consider the traditional groups Agnatha, Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia, which constitute classes in the subphylum Vertebrata.
7.29.95	Many modern authors classify birds within Reptilia, which correctly reflects their evolutionary heritage.
7.29.96	We consider them separately only for convenience.
7.29.97	Further, we will consider hagfishes and lampreys together as jawless fishes, the agnathans, although emerging classification schemes separate them into chordate jawless fishes (the hagfishes) and vertebrate jawless fishes (the lampreys).
7.29.98	Animals that possess jaws are known as gnathostomes, which means “jawed mouth.
7.29.99	” Gnathostomes include fishes and tetrapods—amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
7.29.100	Tetrapods can be further divided into two groups: amphibians and amniotes.
7.29.101	Amniotes are animals whose eggs are adapted for terrestrial living, and this group includes mammals, reptiles, and birds.
7.29.102	Amniotic embryos, developing in either an externally shed egg or an egg carried by the female, are provided with a water-retaining environment and are protected by amniotic membranes.
7.29.103	Modern fishes include an estimated 31,000 species.
7.29.104	Fishes were the earliest vertebrates, with jawless species being the earliest and jawed species evolving later.
7.29.105	They are active feeders, rather than sessile, suspension feeders.
7.29.106	Jawless fishes—the hagfishes and lampreys
7.29.107	—have a distinct cranium and complex sense organs including eyes, distinguishing them from the invertebrate chordates.
7.29.108	Jawless Fishes Jawless fishes are craniates that represent an ancient vertebrate lineage that arose over one half-billion years ago.
7.29.109	In the past, the hagfishes and lampreys were classified together as agnathans.
7.29.110	Today, hagfishes and lampreys are recognized as separate clades, primarily because lampreys are true vertebrates, whereas hagfishes are not.
7.29.111	A defining feature is the lack of paired lateral appendages (fins).
7.29.112	Some of the earliest jawless fishes were the ostracoderms (which translates to “shellskin”).
7.29.113	Ostracoderms were vertebrate fishes encased in bony armor, unlike present-day jawless fishes, which lack bone in their scales.
7.29.114	Myxini:
7.29.115	Hagfishes
7.29.116	The clade Myxini includes at least 20 species of hagfishes.
7.29.117	Hagfishes are eel-like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates, other fishes, and marine mammals (Figure 29.8).
7.29.118	Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world, except for the polar regions.
7.29.119	A unique feature of these animals is the slime glands beneath the skin that release mucus through surface pores.
7.29.120	This mucus allows the hagfish to escape from the grip of predators.
7.29.121	Hagfish can also twist their bodies in a knot to feed and sometimes eat carcasses from the inside out.
7.29.122	Pacific hagfish are scavengers that live on the ocean floor.
7.29.123	The skeleton of a hagfish is composed of cartilage, which includes a cartilaginous notochord that runs the length of the body.
7.29.124	This notochord provides support to the hagfish’s body.
7.29.125	Hagfishes do not replace the notochord with a vertebral column during development, as do true vertebrates.
7.29.126	Petromyzontidae:
7.29.127	Lampreys
7.29.128	The clade Petromyzontidae includes approximately 35–40 or more species of lampreys.
7.29.129	Lampreys are similar to hagfishes in size and shape; however, lampreys possess some vertebral elements.
7.29.130	Lampreys lack paired appendages and bone, as do the hagfishes.
7.29.131	As adults, lampreys are characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth.
7.29.132	Many species have a parasitic stage of their life cycle during which they are ectoparasites of fishes.
7.29.133	These parasitic sea lampreys attach to their lake trout host by suction and use their rough tongues to rasp away flesh in order to feed on the trout’s blood.
7.29.134	Lampreys live primarily in coastal and fresh waters, and have a worldwide distribution, except for in the tropics and polar regions.
7.29.135	Some species are marine, but all species spawn in fresh water.
7.29.136	Eggs are fertilized externally, and the larvae distinctly differ from the adult form, spending 3 to 15 years as suspension feeders.
7.29.137	Once they attain sexual maturity, the adults reproduce and die within days.
7.29.138	Lampreys possess a notochord as adults; however, this notochord is surrounded by a cartilaginous structure called an arcualia, which may resemble an evolutionarily early form of the vertebral column.
7.29.139	Gnathostomes:
7.29.140	Jawed Fishes Gnathostomes or “jaw-mouths” are vertebrates that possess jaws.
7.29.141	One of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw, which is a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food.
7.29.142	The evolution of jaws allowed early gnathostomes to exploit food resources that were unavailable to jawless fishes.
7.29.143	Early gnathostomes also possessed two sets of paired fins, allowing the fishes to maneuver accurately.
7.29.144	Pectoral fins are typically located on the anterior body, and pelvic fins on the posterior.
7.29.145	Evolution of the jaw and paired fins permitted gnathostomes to expand from the sedentary suspension feeding of jawless fishes to become mobile predators.
7.29.146	The ability of gnathostomes to exploit new nutrient sources likely is one reason that they replaced most jawless fishes during the Devonian period.
7.29.147	Two early groups of gnathostomes were the acanthodians and placoderms (Figure 29.10), which arose in the late Silurian period and are now extinct.
7.29.148	Most modern fishes are gnathostomes that belong to the clades Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes.
7.29.149	Dunkleosteous was an enormous placoderm from the Devonian period, 380–360 million years ago.
7.29.150	It measured up to 10 meters in length and weighed up to 3.6 tons.
7.29.151	Chondrichthyes:
7.29.152	Cartilaginous Fishes
7.29.153	The clade Chondrichthyes is diverse, consisting of sharks (Figure 29.11), rays, and skates, together with sawfishes and a few dozen species of fishes called chimaeras, or “ghost” sharks.
7.29.154	”
7.29.155	Chondrichthyes are jawed fishes that possess paired fins and a skeleton made of cartilage.
7.29.156	This clade arose approximately 370 million years ago in the early or middle Devonian.
7.29.157	They are thought to be descended from the placoderms, which had skeletons made of bone; thus, the cartilaginous skeleton of Chondrichthyes is a later development.
7.29.158	Parts of shark skeleton are strengthened by granules of calcium carbonate, but this is not the same as bone.
7.29.159	Most cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats, with a few species living in fresh water for a part or all of their lives.
7.29.160	Most sharks are carnivores that feed on live prey, either swallowing it whole or using their jaws and teeth to tear it into smaller pieces.
7.29.161	Shark teeth likely evolved from the jagged scales that cover their skin, called placoid scales.
7.29.162	Some species of sharks and rays are suspension feeders that feed on plankton.
7.29.163	Hammerhead sharks tend to school during the day and hunt prey at night.
7.29.164	Sharks have well-developed sense organs that aid them in locating prey, including a keen sense of smell and electroreception, with the latter perhaps the most sensitive of any animal.
7.29.165	Organs called ampullae of Lorenzini allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things, including their prey.
7.29.166	Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals.
7.29.167	Sharks, together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians, also have a sense organ called the lateral line, which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water, and is often considered homologous to “hearing” in terrestrial vertebrates.
7.29.168	The lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fish’s body.
7.29.169	Sharks reproduce sexually, and eggs are fertilized internally.
7.29.170	Most species are ovoviviparous: The fertilized egg is retained in the oviduct of the mother’s body and the embryo is nourished by the egg yolk.
7.29.171	The eggs hatch in the uterus, and young are born alive and fully functional.
7.29.172	Some species of sharks are oviparous: They lay eggs that hatch outside of the mother’s body.
7.29.173	Embryos are protected by a shark egg case or “mermaid’s purse”
7.29.174	(Figure 29.12) that has the consistency of leather.
7.29.175	The shark egg case has tentacles that snag in seaweed and give the newborn shark cover.
7.29.176	A few species of sharks are viviparous: The young develop within the mother’s body and she gives live birth.
7.29.177	Shark embryos are clearly visible through these transparent egg cases.
7.29.178	The round structure is the yolk that nourishes the growing embryo.
7.29.179	Rays and skates comprise more than 500 species and are closely related to sharks.
7.29.180	They can be distinguished from sharks by their flattened bodies, pectoral fins that are enlarged and fused to the head, and gill slits on their ventral surface (Figure 29.13).
7.29.181	Like sharks, rays and skates have a cartilaginous skeleton.
7.29.182	Most species are marine and live on the sea floor, with nearly a worldwide distribution.
7.29.183	This stingray blends into the sandy bottom of the ocean floor.
7.29.184	Osteichthyes: Bony Fishes Members of the clade Osteichthyes, also called bony fishes, are characterized by a bony skeleton.
7.29.185	The vast majority of present-day fishes belong to this group, which consists of approximately 30,000 species, making it the largest class of vertebrates in existence today.
7.29.186	Nearly all bony fishes have an ossified skeleton with specialized bone cells (osteocytes) that produce and maintain a calcium phosphate matrix.
7.29.187	This characteristic has only reversed in a few groups of Osteichthyes, such as sturgeons and paddlefish, which have primarily cartilaginous skeletons.
7.29.188	The skin of bony fishes is often covered by overlapping scales, and glands in the skin secrete mucus that reduces drag when swimming and aids the fish in osmoregulation.
7.29.189	Like sharks, bony fishes have a lateral line system that detects vibrations in water.
7.29.190	All bony fishes use gills to breathe.
7.29.191	Water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated by a protective, muscular flap called the operculum.
7.29.192	Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder, a gas-filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish.
7.29.193	Bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades: Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes).
7.29.194	Actinopterygii, the ray-finned fishes, include many familiar fishes—tuna, bass, trout, and salmon (Figure 29.14a), among others.
7.29.195	Ray-finned fishes are named for their fins that are webs of skin supported by bony spines called rays.
7.29.196	In contrast, the fins of Sarcopterygii are fleshy and lobed, supported by bone (Figure 29.14b).
7.29.197	Living members of this clade include the less-familiar lungfishes and coelacanths.
7.29.198	The (a) sockeye salmon and (b) coelacanth are both bony fishes of the Osteichthyes clade.
7.29.199	The coelacanth, sometimes called a lobe-finned fish, was thought to have gone extinct in the Late Cretaceous period, 100 million years ago, until one was discovered in 1938 near the Comoros Islands between Africa and Madagascar.
7.29.200	Amphibians are vertebrate tetrapods.
7.29.201	Amphibia includes frogs, salamanders, and caecilians.
7.29.202	The term amphibian loosely translates from the Greek as “dual life,
7.29.203	” which is a reference to the metamorphosis that many frogs and salamanders undergo and their mixture of aquatic and terrestrial environments in their life cycle.
7.29.204	Amphibians evolved during the Devonian period and were the earliest terrestrial tetrapods.
7.29.205	Characteristics of Amphibians
7.29.206	As tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four well-developed limbs.
7.29.207	Some species of salamanders and all caecilians are functionally limbless; their limbs are vestigial.
7.29.208	An important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist, permeable skin that is achieved via mucus glands that keep the skin moist; thus, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the environment can take place through it ( cutaneous respiration).
7.29.209	Additional characteristics of amphibians include pedicellate teeth—teeth in which the root and crown are calcified, separated by a zone of noncalcified tissue—and a papilla amphibiorum and papilla basilaris, structures of the inner ear that are sensitive to frequencies below and above 10,00 hertz, respectively.
7.29.210	Amphibians also have an auricular operculum, which is an extra bone in the ear that transmits sounds to the inner ear.
7.29.211	All extant adult amphibians are carnivorous, and some terrestrial amphibians have a sticky tongue that is used to capture prey.
7.29.212	Evolution of Amphibians
7.29.213	The fossil record provides evidence of the first tetrapods: now-extinct amphibian species dating to nearly 400 million years ago.
7.29.214	Evolution of tetrapods from fishes represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water, to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period.
7.29.215	One of the earliest known tetrapods is from the genus Acanthostega.
7.29.216	Acanthostega was aquatic; fossils show that it had gills similar to fishes.
7.29.217	However, it also had four limbs, with the skeletal structure of limbs found in present-day tetrapods, including amphibians.
7.29.218	Therefore, it is thought that Acanthostega lived in shallow waters and was an intermediate form between lobe-finned fishes and early, fully terrestrial tetrapods.
7.29.219	What preceded Acanthostega?
7.29.220	In 2006, researchers published news of their discovery of a fossil of a “tetrapod-like fish,” Tiktaalik roseae, which seems to be an intermediate form between fishes having fins and tetrapods having limbs (Figure 29.15).
7.29.221	Tiktaalik likely lived in a shallow water environment about 375 million years ago.
7.29.222	The recent fossil discovery of Tiktaalik roseae suggests evidence for an animal intermediate to finned fish and legged tetrapods.
7.29.223	The early tetrapods that moved onto land had access to new nutrient sources and relatively few predators.
7.29.224	This led to the widespread distribution of tetrapods during the early Carboniferous period, a period sometimes called the “age of the amphibians.
7.29.225	”
7.29.226	Modern Amphibians Amphibia comprises an estimated 6,770 extant species that inhabit tropical and temperate regions around the world.
7.29.227	Amphibians can be divided into three clades:
7.29.228	Urodela (“tailed-ones”), the salamanders; Anura (“tail-less ones”), the frogs; and Apoda (“legless ones”), the caecilians.
7.29.229	Urodela:
7.29.230	Salamanders Salamanders are amphibians that belong to the order Urodela.
7.29.231	Living salamanders (Figure 29.16) include approximately 620 species, some of which are aquatic, other terrestrial, and some that live on land only as adults.
7.29.232	Adult salamanders usually have a generalized tetrapod body plan with four limbs and a tail.
7.29.233	They move by bending their bodies from side to side, called lateral undulation, in a fish-like manner while “walking” their arms and legs fore and aft.
7.29.234	It is thought that their gait is similar to that used by early tetrapods.
7.29.235	Respiration differs among different species.
7.29.236	The majority of salamanders are lungless, and respiration occurs through the skin or through external gills.
7.29.237	Some terrestrial salamanders have primitive lungs; a few species have both gills and lungs.
7.29.238	Unlike frogs, virtually all salamanders rely on internal fertilization of the eggs.
7.29.239	The only male amphibians that possess copulatory structures are the caecilians, so fertilization among salamanders typically involves an elaborate and often prolonged courtship.
7.29.240	Such a courtship allows the successful transfer of sperm from male to female via a spermatophore.
7.29.241	Development in many of the most highly evolved salamanders, which are fully terrestrial, occurs during a prolonged egg stage, with the eggs guarded by the mother.
7.29.242	During this time, the gilled larval stage is found only within the egg capsule, with the gills being resorbed, and metamorphosis being completed, before hatching.
7.29.243	Hatchlings thus resemble tiny adults.
7.29.244	Anura:
7.29.245	Frogs Frogs are amphibians that belong to the order Anura (Figure 29.17).
7.29.246	Anurans are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates, with approximately 5,965 species that occur on all of the continents except Antarctica.
7.29.247	Anurans have a body plan that is more specialized for movement.
7.29.248	Adult frogs use their hind limbs to jump on land.
7.29.249	Frogs have a number of modifications that allow them to avoid predators, including skin that acts as camouflage.
7.29.250	Many species of frogs and salamanders also release defensive chemicals from glands in the skin that are poisonous to predators.
7.29.251	The Australian green tree frog is a nocturnal predator that lives in the canopies of trees near a water source.
7.29.252	Frog eggs are fertilized externally, and like other amphibians, frogs generally lay their eggs in moist environments.
7.29.253	A moist environment is required as eggs lack a shell and thus dehydrate quickly in dry environments.
7.29.254	Frogs demonstrate a great diversity of parental behaviors, with some species laying many eggs and exhibiting little parental care, to species that carry eggs and tadpoles on their hind legs or backs.
7.29.255	The life cycle of frogs, as other amphibians, consists of two distinct stages: the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to an adult stage.
7.29.256	The larval stage of a frog, the tadpole, is often a filter-feeding herbivore.
7.29.257	Tadpoles usually have gills, a lateral line system, long-finned tails, and lack limbs.
7.29.258	At the end of the tadpole stage, frogs undergo metamorphosis into the adult form (Figure 29.18).
7.29.259	During this stage, the gills, tail, and lateral line system disappear, and four limbs develop.
7.29.260	The jaws become larger and are suited for carnivorous feeding, and the digestive system transforms into the typical short gut of a predator.
7.29.261	An eardrum and air-breathing lungs also develop.
7.29.262	These changes during metamorphosis allow the larvae to move onto land in the adult stage.
7.29.263	A juvenile frog metamorphoses into a frog.
7.29.264	Here, the frog has started to develop limbs, but its tadpole tail is still evident.
7.29.265	Apoda:
7.29.266	Caecilians An estimated 185 species comprise caecilians, a group of amphibians that belong to the order Apoda.
7.29.267	Although they are vertebrates, a complete lack of limbs leads to their resemblance to earthworms in appearance.
7.29.268	They are adapted for a soilburrowing or aquatic lifestyle, and they are nearly blind.
7.29.269	These animals are found in the tropics of South America, Africa, and Southern Asia.
7.29.270	They have vestigial limbs, evidence that they evolved from a legged ancestor.
7.29.271	The amniotes —reptiles, birds, and mammals—are distinguished from amphibians by their terrestrially adapted egg, which is protected by amniotic membranes.
7.29.272	The evolution of amniotic membranes meant that the embryos of amniotes were provided with their own aquatic environment, which led to less dependence on water for development and thus allowed the amniotes to branch out into drier environments.
7.29.273	This was a significant development that distinguished them from amphibians, which were restricted to moist environments due their shell-less eggs.
7.29.274	Although the shells of various amniotic species vary significantly, they all allow retention of water.
7.29.275	The shells of bird eggs are composed of calcium carbonate and are hard, but fragile.
7.29.276	The shells of reptile eggs are leathery and require a moist environment.
7.29.277	Most mammals do not lay eggs (except for monotremes).
7.29.278	Instead, the embryo grows within the mother’s body; however, even with this internal gestation, amniotic membranes are still present.
7.29.279	Characteristics of Amniotes
7.29.280	The amniotic egg is the key characteristic of amniotes.
7.29.281	In amniotes that lay eggs, the shell of the egg provides protection for the developing embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen.
7.29.282	The albumin, or egg white, provides the embryo with water and protein, whereas the fattier egg yolk is the energy supply for the embryo, as is the case with the eggs of many other animals, such as amphibians.
7.29.283	However, the eggs of amniotes contain three additional extra-embryonic membranes: the chorion, amnion, and allantois (Figure 29.20).
7.29.284	Extra-embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo.
7.29.285	While the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself, the chorion surrounds the embryo and yolk sac.
7.29.286	The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg’s external environment.
7.29.287	The amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration.
7.29.288	The allantois stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration.
7.29.289	In mammals, membranes that are homologous to the extra-embryonic membranes in eggs are present in the placenta.
7.29.290	Additional derived characteristics of amniotes include waterproof skin, due to the presence of lipids, and costal (rib) ventilation of the lungs.
7.29.291	Evolution of Amniotes
7.29.292	The first amniotes evolved from amphibian ancestors approximately 340 million years ago during the Carboniferous period.
7.29.293	The early amniotes diverged into two main lines soon after the first amniotes arose.
7.29.294	The initial split was into synapsids and sauropsids.
7.29.295	Synapsids include all mammals, including extinct mammalian species.
7.29.296	Synapsids also include therapsids, which were mammal-like reptiles from which mammals evolved.
7.29.297	Sauropsids include reptiles and birds, and can be further divided into anapsids and diapsids.
7.29.298	The key differences between the synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids are the structures of the skull and the number of temporal fenestrae behind each eye
7.29.299	(Figure 29.21).
7.29.300	Temporal fenestrae are post-orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen.
7.29.301	Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae, synapsids have one, and diapsids have two.
7.29.302	Anapsids include extinct organisms and may, based on anatomy, include turtles.
7.29.303	However, this is still controversial, and turtles are sometimes classified as diapsids based on molecular evidence.
7.29.304	The diapsids include birds and all other living and extinct reptiles.
7.29.305	Compare the skulls and temporal fenestrae of anapsids, synapsids, and diapsids.
7.29.306	Anapsids have no openings, synapsids have one opening, and diapsids have two openings.
7.29.307	The diapsids diverged into two groups, the Archosauromorpha (“ancient lizard form”) and the Lepidosauromorpha (“scaly lizard form”) during the Mesozoic period (Figure 29.22).
7.29.308	The lepidosaurs include modern lizards, snakes, and tuataras.
7.29.309	The archosaurs include modern crocodiles and alligators, and the extinct pterosaurs (“winged lizard”) and dinosaurs (“terrible lizard”).
7.29.310	Clade Dinosauria includes birds, which evolved from a branch of dinosaurs.
7.29.311	In the past, the most common division of amniotes has been into the classes Mammalia, Reptilia, and Aves.
7.29.312	Birds are descended, however, from dinosaurs, so this classical scheme results in groups that are not true clades.
7.29.313	We will consider birds as a group distinct from reptiles for the purpose of this discussion with the understanding that this does not completely reflect phylogenetic history and relationships.
7.29.314	Characteristics of Reptiles Reptiles are tetrapods.
7.29.315	Limbless reptiles—snakes and other squamates—have vestigial limbs and, like caecilians, are classified as tetrapods because they are descended from four-limbed ancestors.
7.29.316	Reptiles lay eggs enclosed in shells on land.
7.29.317	Even aquatic reptiles return to the land to lay eggs.
7.29.318	They usually reproduce sexually with internal fertilization.
7.29.319	Some species display ovoviviparity, with the eggs remaining in the mother’s body until they are ready to hatch.
7.29.320	Other species are viviparous, with the offspring born alive.
7.29.321	One of the key adaptations that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of their scaly skin, containing the protein keratin and waxy lipids, which reduced water loss from the skin.
7.29.322	This occlusive skin means that reptiles cannot use their skin for respiration, like amphibians, and thus all breathe with lungs.
7.29.323	Reptiles are ectotherms, animals whose main source of body heat comes from the environment.
7.29.324	This is in contrast to endotherms, which use heat produced by metabolism to regulate body temperature.
7.29.325	In addition to being ectothermic, reptiles are categorized as poikilotherms, or animals whose body temperatures vary rather than remain stable.
7.29.326	Reptiles have behavioral adaptations to help regulate body temperature, such as basking in sunny places to warm up and finding shady spots or going underground to cool down.
7.29.327	The advantage of ectothermy is that metabolic energy from food is not required to heat the body; therefore, reptiles can survive on about 10 percent of the calories required by a similarly sized endotherm.
7.29.328	In cold weather, some reptiles such as the garter snake brumate.
7.29.329	Brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long periods without eating, but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves.
7.29.330	Rather, their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures, and the animal is very sluggish.
7.29.331	Evolution of Reptiles Reptiles originated approximately 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous period.
7.29.332	One of the oldest known amniotes is Casineria, which had both amphibian and reptilian characteristics.
7.29.333	One of the earliest undisputed reptiles was Hylonomus.
7.29.334	Soon after the first amniotes appeared, they diverged into three groups—synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids—during the Permian period.
7.29.335	The Permian period also saw a second major divergence of diapsid reptiles into archosaurs (predecessors of crocodilians and dinosaurs) and lepidosaurs (predecessors of snakes and lizards).
7.29.336	These groups remained inconspicuous until the Triassic period, when the archosaurs became the dominant terrestrial group due to the extinction of large-bodied anapsids and synapsids during the Permian-Triassic extinction.
7.29.337	About 250 million years ago, archosaurs radiated into the dinosaurs and the pterosaurs.
7.29.338	Although they are sometimes mistakenly called dinosaurs, the pterosaurs were distinct from true dinosaurs (Figure 29.23).
7.29.339	Pterosaurs had a number of adaptations that allowed for flight, including hollow bones (birds also exhibit hollow bones, a case of convergent evolution).
7.29.340	Their wings were formed by membranes of skin that attached to the long, fourth finger of each arm and extended along the body to the legs.
7.29.341	Pterosaurs, which existed from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous period (210 to 65.5 million years ago), possessed wings but are not believed to have been capable of powered flight.
7.29.342	Instead, they may have been able to soar after launching from cliffs.
7.29.343	The dinosaurs were a diverse group of terrestrial reptiles with more than 1,000 species identified to date.
7.29.344	Paleontologists continue to discover new species of dinosaurs.
7.29.345	Some dinosaurs were quadrupeds (Figure 29.24); others were bipeds.
7.29.346	Some were carnivorous, whereas others were herbivorous.
7.29.347	Dinosaurs laid eggs, and a number of nests containing fossilized eggs have been found.
7.29.348	It is not known whether dinosaurs were endotherms or ectotherms.
7.29.349	However, given that modern birds are endothermic, the dinosaurs that served as ancestors to birds likely were endothermic as well.
7.29.350	Some fossil evidence exists for dinosaurian parental care, and comparative biology supports this hypothesis since the archosaur birds and crocodilians display parental care.
7.29.351	Edmontonia was an armored dinosaur that lived in the late Cretaceous period, 145.5 to 65.6 million years ago.
7.29.352	Dinosaurs dominated the Mesozoic Era, which was known as the “age of reptiles.
7.29.353	”
7.29.354	The dominance of dinosaurs lasted until the end of the Cretaceous, the last period of the Mesozoic Era.
7.29.355	The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction resulted in the loss of most of the large-bodied animals of the Mesozoic Era.
7.29.356	Birds are the only living descendants of one of the major clades of dinosaurs.
7.29.357	Modern Reptiles Class Reptilia includes many diverse species that are classified into four living clades.
7.29.358	These are the 25 species of Crocodilia, 2 species of Sphenodontia, approximately 9,200 Squamata species, and the Testudines, with about 325 species.
7.29.359	Crocodilia Crocodilia (“small lizard”) arose with a distinct lineage by the middle Triassic; extant species include alligators, crocodiles, and caimans.
7.29.360	Crocodilians (Figure 29.25) live throughout the tropics and subtropics of Africa, South America, Southern Florida, Asia, and Australia.
7.29.361	They are found in freshwater, saltwater, and brackish habitats, such as rivers and lakes, and spend most of their time in water.
7.29.362	Some species are able to move on land due to their semi-erect posture.
7.29.363	Crocodilians, such as this Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis), provide parental care for their offspring.
7.29.364	Sphenodontia Sphenodontia (“wedge tooth”) arose in the Mesozoic era and includes only one living genus, Tuatara, comprising two species that are found in New Zealand (Figure 29.26).
7.29.365	Tuataras measure up to 80 centimeters and weigh about 1 kilogram.
7.29.366	Although quite lizard-like in gross appearance, several unique features of the skull and jaws clearly define them and distinguish the group from the squamates.
7.29.367	This tuatara from New Zealand may resemble a lizard but belongs to a distinct lineage, the Sphenodontidae family.
7.29.368	Squamata Squamata (“scaly”) arose in the late Permian, and extant species include lizards and snakes.
7.29.369	Both are found on all continents except Antarctica.
7.29.370	Lizards and snakes are most closely related to tuataras, both groups having evolved from a lepidosaurian ancestor.
7.29.371	Squamata is the largest extant clade of reptiles (Figure 29.27).
7.29.372	Most lizards differ from snakes by having four limbs, although these have been variously lost or significantly reduced in at least 60 lineages.
7.29.373	Snakes lack eyelids and external ears, which are present in lizards.
7.29.374	Lizard species range in size from chameleons and geckos, which are a few centimeters in length, to the Komodo dragon, which is about 3 meters in length.
7.29.375	Most lizards are carnivorous, but some large species, such as iguanas, are herbivores.
7.29.376	This Jackson’s chameleon (Trioceros jacksonii) blends in with its surroundings.
7.29.377	Snakes are thought to have descended from either burrowing lizards or aquatic lizards over 100 million years ago (Figure 29.28).
7.29.378	Snakes comprise about 3,000 species and are found on every continent except Antarctica.
7.29.379	They range in size from 10 centimeter-long thread snakes to 10 meter-long pythons and anacondas.
7.29.380	All snakes are carnivorous and eat small animals, birds, eggs, fish, and insects.
7.29.381	The snake body form is so specialized that, in its general morphology, a “snake is a snake.
7.29.382	”
7.29.383	Their specializations all point to snakes having evolved to feed on relatively large prey (even though some current species have reversed this trend).
7.29.384	Although variations exist, most snakes have a skull that is very flexible, involving eight rotational joints.
7.29.385	They also differ from other squamates by having mandibles (lower jaws) without either bony or ligamentous attachment anteriorly.
7.29.386	Having this connection via skin and muscle allows for great expansion of the gape and independent motion of the two sides—both advantages in swallowing big items.
7.29.387	The garter snake belongs to the genus Thamnophis, the most widely distributed reptile genus in North America.
7.29.388	Testudines Turtles are members of the clade Testudines (“having a shell”)
7.29.389	(Figure 29.29).
7.29.390	Turtles are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell.
7.29.391	The shell consists of the ventral surface called the plastron and the dorsal surface called the carapace, which develops from the ribs.
7.29.392	The plastron is made of scutes or plates; the scutes can be used to differentiate species of turtles.
7.29.393	The two clades of turtles are most easily recognized by how they retract their necks.
7.29.394	The dominant group, which includes all North American species, retracts its neck in a vertical S-curve.
7.29.395	Turtles in the less speciose clade retract the neck with a horizontal curve.
7.29.396	Turtles arose approximately 200 million years ago, predating crocodiles, lizards, and snakes.
7.29.397	Similar to other reptiles, turtles are ectotherms.
7.29.398	They lay eggs on land, although many species live in or near water.
7.29.399	None exhibit parental care.
7.29.400	Turtles range in size from the speckled padloper tortoise at 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) to the leatherback sea turtle at 200 centimeters (over 6 feet).
7.29.401	The term “turtle” is sometimes used to describe only those species of Testudines that live in the sea, with the terms “tortoise” and “terrapin” used to refer to species that live on land and in fresh water, respectively.
7.29.402	The African spurred tortoise (Geochelone sulcata) lives at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.
7.29.403	It is the third largest tortoise in the world.
7.29.404	The most obvious characteristic that sets birds apart from other modern vertebrates is the presence of feathers, which are modified scales.
7.29.405	While vertebrates like bats fly without feathers, birds rely on feathers and wings, along with other modifications of body structure and physiology, for flight.
7.29.406	Characteristics of Birds Birds are endothermic, and because they fly, they require large amounts of energy, necessitating a high metabolic rate.
7.29.407	Like mammals, which are also endothermic, birds have an insulating covering that keeps heat in the body: feathers.
7.29.408	Specialized feathers called down feathers are especially insulating, trapping air in spaces between each feather to decrease the rate of heat loss.
7.29.409	Certain parts of a bird’s body are covered in down feathers, and the base of other feathers have a downy portion, whereas newly hatched birds are covered in down.
7.29.410	Feathers not only act as insulation but also allow for flight, enabling the lift and thrust necessary to become airborne.
7.29.411	The feathers on a wing are flexible, so the collective feathers move and separate as air moves through them, reducing the drag on the wing.
7.29.412	Flight feathers are asymmetrical, which affects airflow over them and provides some of the lifting and thrusting force required for flight (Figure 29.30).
7.29.413	Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings, primary feathers and secondary feathers.
7.29.414	Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust.
7.29.415	Secondary feathers are located closer to the body, attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift.
7.29.416	Contour feathers are the feathers found on the body, and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight.
7.29.417	They create a smooth, aerodynamic surface so that air moves smoothly over the bird’s body, allowing for efficient flight.
7.29.418	Primary feathers are located at the wing tip and provide thrust; secondary feathers are located close to the body and provide lift.
7.29.419	Flapping of the entire wing occurs primarily through the actions of the chest muscles, the pectoralis and the supracoracoideus.
7.29.420	These muscles are highly developed in birds and account for a higher percentage of body mass than in most mammals.
7.29.421	These attach to a blade-shaped keel, like that of a boat, located on the sternum.
7.29.422	The sternum of birds is larger than that of other vertebrates, which accommodates the large muscles required to generate enough upward force to generate lift with the flapping of the wings.
7.29.423	Another skeletal modification found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles (collarbones), forming the furcula or wishbone.
7.29.424	The furcula is flexible enough to bend and provide support to the shoulder girdle during flapping.
7.29.425	An important requirement of flight is a low body weight.
7.29.426	As body weight increases, the muscle output required for flying increases.
7.29.427	The largest living bird is the ostrich, and while it is much smaller than the largest mammals, it is flightless.
7.29.428	For birds that do fly, reduction in body weight makes flight easier.
7.29.429	Several modifications are found in birds to reduce body weight, including pneumatization of bones.
7.29.430	Pneumatic bones are bones that are hollow, rather than filled with tissue (Figure 29.31).
7.29.431	They contain air spaces that are sometimes connected to air sacs, and they have struts of bone to provide structural reinforcement.
7.29.432	Pneumatic bones are not found in all birds, and they are more extensive in large birds than in small birds.
7.29.433	Not all bones of the skeleton are pneumatic, although the skulls of almost all birds are.
7.29.434	Many birds have hollow, pneumatic bones, which make flight easier.
7.29.435	Other modifications that reduce weight include the lack of a urinary bladder.
7.29.436	Birds possess a cloaca, a structure that allows water to be reabsorbed from waste back into the bloodstream.
7.29.437	Uric acid is not expelled as a liquid but is concentrated into urate salts, which are expelled along with fecal matter.
7.29.438	In this way, water is not held in the urinary bladder, which would increase body weight.
7.29.439	Most bird species only possess one ovary rather than two, further reducing body mass.
7.29.440	The air sacs that extend into bones to form pneumatic bones also join with the lungs and function in respiration.
7.29.441	Unlike mammalian lungs in which air flows in two directions, as it is breathed in and out, airflow through bird lungs travels in one direction (Figure 29.32).
7.29.442	Air sacs allow for this unidirectional airflow, which also creates a cross-current exchange system with the blood.
7.29.443	In a cross-current or counter-current system, the air flows in one direction and the blood flows in the opposite direction, creating a very efficient means of gas exchange.
7.29.444	Avian respiration is an efficient system of gas exchange with air flowing unidirectionally.
7.29.445	During inhalation, air passes from the trachea into posterior air sacs, then through the lungs to anterior air sacs.
7.29.446	The air sacs are connected to the hollow interior of bones.
7.29.447	During exhalation, air from air sacs passes into the lungs and out the trachea.
7.29.448	Evolution of Birds
7.29.449	The evolutionary history of birds is still somewhat unclear.
7.29.450	Due to the fragility of bird bones, they do not fossilize as well as other vertebrates.
7.29.451	Birds are diapsids, meaning they have two fenestrations or openings in their skulls.
7.29.452	Birds belong to a group of diapsids called the archosaurs, which also includes crocodiles and dinosaurs.
7.29.453	It is commonly accepted that birds evolved from dinosaurs.
7.29.454	Dinosaurs (including birds) are further subdivided into two groups, the Saurischia (“lizard like”) and the Ornithischia (“bird like”).
7.29.455	Despite the names of these groups, it was not the bird-like dinosaurs that gave rise to modern birds.
7.29.456	Rather, Saurischia diverged into two groups: One included the long-necked herbivorous dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus.
7.29.457	The second group, bipedal predators called theropods, includes birds.
7.29.458	This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds, specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones, as well as the presence of the wishbone, formed by the fusing of the clavicles.
7.29.459	One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx, which is from the Jurassic period (Figure 29.33).
7.29.460	Archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, because it is an intermediate fossil, meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds.
7.29.461	Some scientists propose classifying it as a bird, but others prefer to classify it as a dinosaur.
7.29.462	The fossilized skeleton of Archaeopteryx looks like that of a dinosaur, and it had teeth whereas birds do not, but it also had feathers modified for flight, a trait associated only with birds among modern animals.
7.29.463	Fossils of older feathered dinosaurs exist, but the feathers do not have the characteristics of flight feathers.
7.29.464	(a) Archaeopteryx lived in the late Jurassic Period around 150 million years ago.
7.29.465	It had teeth like a dinosaur, but had (b) flight feathers like modern birds, which can be seen in this fossil.
7.29.466	It is still unclear exactly how flight evolved in birds.
7.29.467	Two main theories exist, the arboreal (“tree”) hypothesis and the terrestrial (
7.29.468	“land”) hypothesis.
7.29.469	The arboreal hypothesis posits that tree-dwelling precursors to modern birds jumped from branch to branch using their feathers for gliding before becoming fully capable of flapping flight.
7.29.470	In contrast to this, the terrestrial hypothesis holds that running was the stimulus for flight, as wings could be used to improve running and then became used for flapping flight.
7.29.471	Like the question of how flight evolved, the question of how endothermy evolved in birds still is unanswered.
7.29.472	Feathers provide insulation, but this is only beneficial if body heat is being produced internally.
7.29.473	Similarly, internal heat production is only viable if insulation is present to retain that heat.
7.29.474	It has been suggested that one or the other—feathers or endothermy—evolved in response to some other selective pressure.
7.29.475	During the Cretaceous period, a group known as the Enantiornithes was the dominant bird type (Figure 29.34).
7.29.476	Enantiornithes means “opposite birds,” which refers to the fact that certain bones of the feet are joined differently than the way the bones are joined in modern birds.
7.29.477	These birds formed an evolutionary line separate from modern birds, and they did not survive past the Cretaceous.
7.29.478	Along with the Enantiornithes, Ornithurae birds (the evolutionary line that includes modern birds) were also present in the Cretaceous.
7.29.479	After the extinction of Enantiornithes, modern birds became the dominant bird, with a large radiation occurring during the Cenozoic Era.
7.29.480	Referred to as Neornithes (“new birds”), modern birds are now classified into two groups, the Paleognathae (“old jaw”) or ratites, a group of flightless birds including ostriches, emus, rheas, and kiwis, and the Neognathae (“new jaw”), which includes all other birds.
7.29.481	Shanweiniao cooperorum was a species of Enantiornithes that did not survive past the Cretaceous period.
7.29.482	Mammals are vertebrates that possess hair and mammary glands.
7.29.483	Several other characteristics are distinctive to mammals, including certain features of the jaw, skeleton, integument, and internal anatomy.
7.29.484	Modern mammals belong to three clades: monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians (or placental mammals).
7.29.485	Characteristics of Mammals
7.29.486	The presence of hair is one of the most obvious signs of a mammal.
7.29.487	Although it is not very extensive on certain species, such as whales, hair has many important functions for mammals.
7.29.488	Mammals are endothermic, and hair provides insulation to retain heat generated by metabolic work.
7.29.489	Hair traps a layer of air close to the body, retaining heat.
7.29.490	Along with insulation, hair can serve as a sensory mechanism via specialized hairs called vibrissae, better known as whiskers.
7.29.491	These attach to nerves that transmit information about sensation, which is particularly useful to nocturnal or burrowing mammals.
7.29.492	Hair can also provide protective coloration or be part of social signaling, such as when an animal’s hair stands “on end.
7.29.493	”
7.29.494	Mammalian integument, or skin, includes secretory glands with various functions.
7.29.495	Sebaceous glands produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin for water resistance and lubrication.
7.29.496	Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body.
7.29.497	Eccrine glands produce sweat, or perspiration, which is mainly composed of water.
7.29.498	In most mammals, eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body, and some mammals do not possess them at all.
7.29.499	However, in primates, especially humans, sweat figures prominently in thermoregulation, regulating the body through evaporative cooling.
7.29.500	Sweat glands are located over most of the body surface in primates.
7.29.501	Apocrine glands, or scent glands, secrete substances that are used for chemical communication, such as in skunks.
7.29.502	Mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns.
7.29.503	While male monotremes and eutherians possess mammary glands, male marsupials do not.
7.29.504	Mammary glands likely are modified sebaceous or eccrine glands, but their evolutionary origin is not entirely clear.
7.29.505	The skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features.
7.29.506	The lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone, the dentary.
7.29.507	The jaws of other vertebrates are composed of more than one bone.
7.29.508	In mammals, the dentary bone joins the skull at the squamosal bone, while in other vertebrates, the quadrate bone of the jaw joins with the articular bone of the skull.
7.29.509	These bones are present in mammals, but they have been modified to function in hearing and form bones in the middle ear (Figure 29.35).
7.29.510	Other vertebrates possess only one middle ear bone, the stapes.
7.29.511	Mammals have three: the malleus, incus, and stapes.
7.29.512	The malleus originated from the articular bone, whereas the incus originated from the quadrate bone.
7.29.513	This arrangement of jaw and ear bones aids in distinguishing fossil mammals from fossils of other synapsids.
7.29.514	Bones of the mammalian inner ear are modified from bones of the jaw and skull.
7.29.515	The adductor muscle that closes the jaw is composed of two muscles in mammals: the temporalis and the masseter.
7.29.516	These allow side-to-side movement of the jaw, making chewing possible, which is unique to mammals.
7.29.517	Most mammals have heterodont teeth, meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth.
7.29.518	Most mammals are diphyodonts, meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: deciduous or “baby” teeth, and permanent teeth.
7.29.519	Other vertebrates are polyphyodonts, that is, their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life.
7.29.520	Mammals, like birds, possess a four-chambered heart.
7.29.521	Mammals also have a specialized group of cardiac fibers located in the walls of their right atrium called the sinoatrial node, or pacemaker, which determines the rate at which the heart beats.
7.29.522	Mammalian erythrocytes (red blood cells) do not have nuclei, whereas the erythrocytes of other vertebrates are nucleated.
7.29.523	The kidneys of mammals have a portion of the nephron called the loop of Henle or nephritic loop, which allows mammals to produce urine with a high concentration of solutes, higher than that of the blood.
7.29.524	Mammals lack a renal portal system, which is a system of veins that moves blood from the hind or lower limbs and region of the tail to the kidneys.
7.29.525	Renal portal systems are present in all other vertebrates except jawless fishes.
7.29.526	A urinary bladder is present in all mammals.
7.29.527	Mammalian brains have certain characteristics that differ from other vertebrates.
7.29.528	In some, but not all mammals, the cerebral cortex, the outermost part of the cerebrum, is highly folded, allowing for a greater surface area than is possible with a smooth cortex.
7.29.529	The optic lobes, located in the midbrain, are divided into two parts in mammals, whereas other vertebrates possess a single, undivided lobe.
7.29.530	Eutherian mammals also possess a specialized structure that links the two cerebral hemispheres, called the corpus callosum.
7.29.531	Evolution of Mammals Mammals are synapsids, meaning they have a single opening in the skull.
7.29.532	They are the only living synapsids, as earlier forms became extinct by the Jurassic period.
7.29.533	The early non-mammalian synapsids can be divided into two groups, the pelycosaurs and the therapsids.
7.29.534	Within the therapsids, a group called the cynodonts are thought to be the ancestors of mammals.
7.29.535	Cynodonts, which first appeared in the Late Permian period 260 million years ago, are thought to be the ancestors of modern mammals.
7.29.536	A key characteristic of synapsids is endothermy, rather than the ectothermy seen in most other vertebrates.
7.29.537	The increased metabolic rate required to internally modify body temperature went hand in hand with changes to certain skeletal structures.
7.29.538	The later synapsids, which had more evolved characteristics unique to mammals, possess cheeks for holding food and heterodont teeth, which are specialized for chewing, mechanically breaking down food to speed digestion and releasing the energy needed to produce heat.
7.29.539	Chewing also requires the ability to chew and breathe at the same time, which is facilitated by the presence of a secondary palate.
7.29.540	A secondary palate separates the area of the mouth where chewing occurs from the area above where respiration occurs, allowing breathing to proceed uninterrupted during chewing.
7.29.541	A secondary palate is not found in pelycosaurs but is present in cynodonts and mammals.
7.29.542	The jawbone also shows changes from early synapsids to later ones.
7.29.543	The zygomatic arch, or cheekbone, is present in mammals and advanced therapsids such as cynodonts, but is not present in pelycosaurs.
7.29.544	The presence of the zygomatic arch suggests the presence of the masseter muscle, which closes the jaw and functions in chewing.
7.29.545	In the appendicular skeleton, the shoulder girdle of therian mammals is modified from that of other vertebrates in that it does not possess a procoracoid bone or an interclavicle, and the scapula is the dominant bone.
7.29.546	Mammals evolved from therapsids in the late Triassic period, as the earliest known mammal fossils are from the early Jurassic period, some 205 million years ago.
7.29.547	Early mammals were small, about the size of a small rodent.
7.29.548	Mammals first began to diversify in the Mesozoic Era, from the Jurassic to the Cretaceous periods, although most of these mammals were extinct by the end of the Mesozoic.
7.29.549	During the Cretaceous period, another radiation of mammals began and continued through the Cenozoic Era, about 65 million years ago.
7.29.550	Living Mammals
7.29.551	The eutherians, or placental mammals, and the marsupials together comprise the clade of therian mammals.
7.29.552	Monotremes, or metatherians, form their sister clade.
7.29.553	There are three living species of monotremes: the platypus and two species of echidnas, or spiny anteaters.
7.29.554	The leatherybeaked platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae (“bird beak”), whereas echidnas belong to the family
7.29.555	Tachyglossidae (“sticky tongue”)
7.29.556	(Figure 29.37).
7.29.557	The platypus and one species of echidna are found in Australia, and the other species of echidna is found in New Guinea.
7.29.558	Monotremes are unique among mammals as they lay eggs, rather than giving birth to live young.
7.29.559	The shells of their eggs are not like the hard shells of birds, but are a leathery shell, similar to the shells of reptile eggs.
7.29.560	Monotremes have no teeth.
7.29.561	(a)
7.29.562	The platypus, a monotreme, possesses a leathery beak and lays eggs rather than giving birth to live young.
7.29.563	(b)
7.29.564	The echidna is another monotreme.
7.29.565	Marsupials are found primarily in Australia, though the opossum is found in North America.
7.29.566	Australian marsupials include the kangaroo, koala, bandicoot, Tasmanian devil (Figure 29.38), and several other species.
7.29.567	Most species of marsupials possess a pouch in which the very premature young reside after birth, receiving milk and continuing to develop.
7.29.568	Marsupials differ from eutherians in that there is a less complex placental connection: The young are born at an extremely early age and latch onto the nipple within the pouch.
7.29.569	The Tasmanian devil is one of several marsupials native to Australia.
7.29.570	Eutherians are the most widespread of the mammals, occurring throughout the world.
7.29.571	There are 18 to 20 orders of placental mammals.
7.29.572	Some examples are Insectivora, the insect eaters; Edentata, the toothless anteaters; Rodentia, the rodents; Cetacea, the aquatic mammals including whales; Carnivora, carnivorous mammals including dogs, cats, and bears; and Primates, which includes humans.
7.29.573	Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals because all species possess a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother, allowing for gas, fluid, and nutrient exchange.
7.29.574	While other mammals possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta, all eutherians possess a complex placenta during gestation.
7.29.575	Order Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans.
7.29.576	Non-human primates live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia.
7.29.577	They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1 ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds).
7.29.578	The characteristics and evolution of primates is of particular interest to us as it allows us to understand the evolution of our own species.
7.29.579	Characteristics of Primates
7.29.580	All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers.
7.29.581	This arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation, or climbing and swinging through trees.
7.29.582	These adaptations include, but are not limited to: 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs, which are widely separated from fingers (except humans), which allow for gripping branches, 3) stereoscopic vision, two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes, which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance.
7.29.583	Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright.
7.29.584	Order Primates is divided into two groups: prosimians and anthropoids.
7.29.585	Prosimians include the bush babies of Africa, the lemurs of Madagascar, and the lorises, pottos, and tarsiers of Southeast Asia.
7.29.586	Anthropoids include monkeys, apes, and humans.
7.29.587	In general, prosimians tend to be nocturnal (in contrast to diurnal anthropoids) and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids.
7.29.588	Evolution of Primates
7.29.589	The first primate-like mammals are referred to as proto-primates.
7.29.590	They were roughly similar to squirrels and tree shrews in size and appearance.
7.29.591	The existing fossil evidence (mostly from North Africa) is very fragmented.
7.29.592	These proto-primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available.
7.29.593	The oldest known primate-like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record is Plesiadapis (although some researchers do not agree that Plesiadapis was a protoprimate).
7.29.594	Fossils of this primate have been dated to approximately 55 million years ago.
7.29.595	Plesiadapiforms were protoprimates that had some features of the teeth and skeleton in common with true primates.
7.29.596	They were found in North America and Europe in the Cenozoic and went extinct by the end of the Eocene.
7.29.597	The first true primates were found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa in the Eocene Epoch.
7.29.598	These early primates resembled present-day prosimians such as lemurs.
7.29.599	Evolutionary changes continued in these early primates, with larger brains and eyes, and smaller muzzles being the trend.
7.29.600	By the end of the Eocene Epoch, many of the early prosimian species went extinct due either to cooler temperatures or competition from the first monkeys.
7.29.601	Anthropoid monkeys evolved from prosimians during the Oligocene Epoch.
7.29.602	By 40 million years ago, evidence indicates that monkeys were present in the New World (South America) and the Old World (Africa and Asia).
7.29.603	New World monkeys are also called Platyrrhini—a reference to their broad noses (Figure 29.39).
7.29.604	Old World monkeys are called Catarrhini—a reference to their narrow noses.
7.29.605	There is still quite a bit of uncertainty about the origins of the New World monkeys.
7.29.606	At the time the platyrrhines arose, the continents of South American and Africa had drifted apart.
7.29.607	Therefore, it is thought that monkeys arose in the Old World and reached the New World either by drifting on log rafts or by crossing land bridges.
7.29.608	Due to this reproductive isolation, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys underwent separate adaptive radiations over millions of years.
7.29.609	The New World monkeys are all arboreal, whereas Old World monkeys include arboreal and grounddwelling species.
7.29.610	The howler monkey is native to Central and South America.
7.29.611	It makes a call that sounds like a lion roaring.
7.29.612	Apes evolved from the catarrhines in Africa midway through the Cenozoic, approximately 25 million years ago.
7.29.613	Apes are generally larger than monkeys and they do not possess a tail.
7.29.614	All apes are capable of moving through trees, although many species spend most their time on the ground.
7.29.615	Apes are more intelligent than monkeys, and they have relatively larger brains proportionate to body size.
7.29.616	The apes are divided into two groups.
7.29.617	The lesser apes comprise the family Hylobatidae, including gibbons and siamangs.
7.29.618	The great apes include the genera Pan (chimpanzees and bonobos) (Figure 29.40a), Gorilla (gorillas), Pongo (orangutans), and Homo (humans)
7.29.619	(Figure 29.40b).
7.29.620	The very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes; they have low sexual dimorphism (that is, the genders are not markedly different in size); and they have relatively longer arms used for swinging through trees.
7.29.621	The (a) chimpanzee is one of the great apes.
7.29.622	It possesses a relatively large brain and has no tail.
7.29.623	(b)
7.29.624	All great apes have a similar skeletal structure.
7.29.625	Human Evolution
7.29.626	The family Hominidae of order Primates includes the hominoids: the great apes (Figure 29.41).
7.29.627	Evidence from the fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee DNA suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common hominoid ancestor approximately 6 million years ago.
7.29.628	Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans, although our species is the only surviving member.
7.29.629	The term hominin is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line, thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees.
7.29.630	Hominins were predominantly bipedal and include those groups that likely gave rise to our species—including Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus—and those non-ancestral groups that can be considered “cousins” of modern humans, such as Neanderthals.
7.29.631	Determining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult.
7.29.632	In years past, when relatively few hominin fossils had been recovered, some scientists believed that considering them in order, from oldest to youngest, would demonstrate the course of evolution from early hominins to modern humans.
7.29.633	In the past several years, however, many new fossils have been found, and it is clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one time and that many of the fossils found (and species named) represent hominin species that died out and are not ancestral to modern humans.
7.29.634	This chart shows the evolution of modern humans.
7.29.635	Very Early Hominins Three species of very early hominids have made news in the past few years.
7.29.636	The oldest of these, Sahelanthropus tchadensis, has been dated to nearly 7 million years ago.
7.29.637	There is a single specimen of this genus, a skull that was a surface find in Chad.
7.29.638	The fossil, informally called “Toumai,” is a mosaic of primitive and evolved characteristics, and it is unclear how this fossil fits with the picture given by molecular data, namely that the line leading to modern humans and modern chimpanzees apparently bifurcated about 6 million years ago.
7.29.639	It is not thought at this time that this species was an ancestor of modern humans.
7.29.640	A second, younger species, Orrorin tugenensis, is also a relatively recent discovery, found in 2000.
7.29.641	There are several specimens of Orrorin.
7.29.642	It is not known whether Orrorin was a human ancestor, but this possibility has not been ruled out.
7.29.643	Some features of Orrorin are more similar to those of modern humans than are the australopiths, although Orrorin is much older.
7.29.644	A third genus, Ardipithecus, was discovered in the 1990s, and the scientists who discovered the first fossil found that some other scientists did not believe the organism to be a biped (thus, it would not be considered a hominid).
7.29.645	In the intervening years, several more specimens of Ardipithecus, classified as two different species, demonstrated that the organism was bipedal.
7.29.646	Again, the status of this genus as a human ancestor is uncertain.
7.29.647	Early Hominins:
7.29.648	Genus Australopithecus Australopithecus (“southern ape”) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately 4 million years ago and went extinct about 2 million years ago.
7.29.649	This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus, genus Homo, evolved from Australopithecus about 2 million years ago (after likely passing through some transitional states).
7.29.650	Australopithecus had a number of characteristics that were more similar to the great apes than to modern humans.
7.29.651	For example, sexual dimorphism was more exaggerated than in modern humans.
7.29.652	Males were up to 50 percent larger than females, a ratio that is similar to that seen in modern gorillas and orangutans.
7.29.653	In contrast, modern human males are approximately 15 to 20 percent larger than females.
7.29.654	The brain size of Australopithecus relative to its body mass was also smaller than modern humans and more similar to that seen in the great apes.
7.29.655	A key feature that Australopithecus had in common with modern humans was bipedalism, although it is likely that Australopithecus also spent time in trees.
7.29.656	Hominin footprints, similar to those of modern humans, were found in Laetoli, Tanzania and dated to 3.6 million years ago.
7.29.657	They showed that hominins at the time of Australopithecus were walking upright.
7.29.658	There were a number of Australopithecus species, which are often referred to as australopiths.
7.29.659	Australopithecus anamensis lived about 4.2 million years ago.
7.29.660	More is known about another early species, Australopithecus afarensis, which lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago.
7.29.661	This species demonstrates a trend in human evolution: the reduction of the dentition and jaw in size.
7.29.662	A. afarensis (Figure 29.42) had smaller canines and molars compared to apes, but these were larger than those of modern humans.
7.29.663	Its brain size was 380–450 cubic centimeters, approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain.
7.29.664	It also had prognathic jaws, which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans.
7.29.665	In the mid-1970s, the fossil of an adult female A. afarensis was found in the Afar region of Ethiopia and dated to 3.24 million years ago (Figure 29.43).
7.29.666	The fossil, which is informally called “Lucy,” is significant because it was the most complete australopith fossil found, with 40 percent of the skeleton recovered.
7.29.667	The skull of (a) Australopithecus afarensis, an early hominid that lived between two and three million years ago, resembled that of (b) modern humans but was smaller with a sloped forehead and prominent jaw.
7.29.668	This adult female Australopithecus afarensis skeleton, nicknamed Lucy, was discovered in the mid 1970s.
7.29.669	Australopithecus africanus lived between 2 and 3 million years ago.
7.29.670	It had a slender build and was bipedal, but had robust arm bones and, like other early hominids, may have spent significant time in trees.
7.29.671	Its brain was larger than that of A. afarensis at 500 cubic centimeters, which is slightly less than one-third the size of modern human brains.
7.29.672	Two other species, Australopithecus bahrelghazali and Australopithecus garhi, have been added to the roster of australopiths in recent years.
7.29.673	A Dead End: Genus Paranthropus
7.29.674	The australopiths had a relatively slender build and teeth that were suited for soft food.
7.29.675	In the past several years, fossils of hominids of a different body type have been found and dated to approximately 2.5 million years ago.
7.29.676	These hominids, of the genus Paranthropus, were relatively large and had large grinding teeth.
7.29.677	Their molars showed heavy wear, suggesting that they had a coarse and fibrous vegetarian diet as opposed to the partially carnivorous diet of the australopiths.
7.29.678	Paranthropus includes Paranthropus robustus of South Africa, and Paranthropus aethiopicus and Paranthropus boisei of East Africa.
7.29.679	The hominids in this genus went extinct more than 1 million years ago and are not thought to be ancestral to modern humans, but rather members of an evolutionary branch on the hominin tree that left no descendants.
7.29.680	Early Hominins:
7.29.681	Genus Homo
7.29.682	The human genus, Homo, first appeared between 2.5 and 3 million years ago.
7.29.683	For many years, fossils of a species called H. habilis were the oldest examples in the genus Homo, but in 2010, a new species called Homo gautengensis was discovered and may be older.
7.29.684	Compared to A. africanus, H. habilis had a number of features more similar to modern humans.
7.29.685	H. habilis had a jaw that was less prognathic than the australopiths and a larger brain, at 600–750 cubic centimeters.
7.29.686	However, H. habilis retained some features of older hominin species, such as long arms.
7.29.687	The name H. habilis means “handy man,” which is a reference to the stone tools that have been found with its remains.
7.29.688	H. erectus appeared approximately 1.8 million years ago (Figure 29.44).
7.29.689	It is believed to have originated in East Africa and was the first hominin species to migrate out of Africa.
7.29.690	Fossils of H. erectus have been found in India, China, Java, and Europe, and were known in the past as “
7.29.691	Java Man” or “Peking Man.
7.29.692	” H. erectus had a number of features that were more similar to modern humans than those of H. habilis.
7.29.693	H. erectus was larger in size than earlier hominins, reaching heights up to 1.85 meters and weighing up to 65 kilograms, which are sizes similar to those of modern humans.
7.29.694	Its degree of sexual dimorphism was less than earlier species, with males being 20 to 30 percent larger than females, which is close to the size difference seen in our species.
7.29.695	H. erectus had a larger brain than earlier species at 775–1,100 cubic centimeters, which compares to the 1,130–1,260 cubic centimeters seen in modern human brains.
7.29.696	H. erectus also had a nose with downward-facing nostrils similar to modern humans, rather than the forward facing nostrils found in other primates.
7.29.697	Longer, downward-facing nostrils allow for the warming of cold air before it enters the lungs and may have been an adaptation to colder climates.
7.29.698	Artifacts found with fossils of H. erectus suggest that it was the first hominin to use fire, hunt, and have a home base.
7.29.699	H. erectus is generally thought to have lived until about 50,000 years ago.
7.29.700	Homo erectus had a prominent brow and a nose that pointed downward rather than forward.
7.29.701	Humans:
7.29.702	Homo sapiens A number of species, sometimes called archaic Homo sapiens, apparently evolved from H. erectus starting about 500,000 years ago.
7.29.703	These species include Homo heidelbergensis, Homo rhodesiensis, and Homo neanderthalensis.
7.29.704	These archaic H. sapiens had a brain size similar to that of modern humans, averaging 1,200–1,400 cubic centimeters.
7.29.705	They differed from modern humans by having a thick skull, a prominent brow ridge, and a receding chin.
7.29.706	Some of these species survived until 30,000–10,000 years ago, overlapping with modern humans.
7.29.707	The Homo neanderthalensis used tools and may have worn clothing.
7.29.708	There is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or Homo sapiens sapiens.
7.29.709	As discussed earlier, H. erectus migrated out of Africa and into Asia and Europe in the first major wave of migration about 1.5 million years ago.
7.29.710	It is thought that modern humans arose in Africa from H. erectus and migrated out of Africa about 100,000 years ago in a second major migration wave.
7.29.711	Then, modern humans replaced H. erectus species that had migrated into Asia and Europe in the first wave.
7.29.712	This evolutionary timeline is supported by molecular evidence.
7.29.713	One approach to studying the origins of modern humans is to examine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from populations around the world.
7.29.714	Because a fetus develops from an egg containing its mother’s mitochondria (which have their own, non-nuclear DNA), mtDNA is passed entirely through the maternal line.
7.29.715	Mutations in mtDNA can now be used to estimate the timeline of genetic divergence.
7.29.716	The resulting evidence suggests that all modern humans have mtDNA inherited from a common ancestor that lived in Africa about 160,000 years ago.
7.29.717	Another approach to the molecular understanding of human evolution is to examine the Y chromosome, which is passed from father to son.
7.29.718	This evidence suggests that all men today inherited a Y chromosome from a male that lived in Africa about 140,000 years ago.
7.30.0	A locust leaf consists of leaflets arrayed along a central midrib.
7.30.1	Each leaflet is a complex photosynthetic machine, exquisitely adapted to capture sunlight and carbon dioxide.
7.30.2	An intricate vascular system supplies the leaf with water and minerals, and exports the products of photosynthesis.
7.30.3	Plants are as essential to human existence as land, water, and air.
7.30.4	Without plants, our day-to-day lives would be impossible because without oxygen from photosynthesis, aerobic life cannot be sustained.
7.30.5	From providing food and shelter to serving as a source of medicines, oils, perfumes, and industrial products, plants provide humans with numerous valuable resources.
7.30.6	When you think of plants, most of the organisms that come to mind are vascular plants.
7.30.7	These plants have tissues that conduct food and water, and they have seeds.
7.30.8	Seed plants are divided into gymnosperms and angiosperms.
7.30.9	Gymnosperms include the needle-leaved conifers—spruce, fir, and pine—as well as less familiar plants, such as ginkgos and cycads.
7.30.10	Their seeds are not enclosed by a fleshy fruit.
7.30.11	Angiosperms, also called flowering plants, constitute the majority of seed plants.
7.30.12	They include broadleaved trees (such as maple, oak, and elm), vegetables (such as potatoes, lettuce, and carrots), grasses, and plants known for the beauty of their flowers (roses, irises, and daffodils, for example).
7.30.13	While individual plant species are unique, all share a common structure: a plant body consisting of stems, roots, and leaves.
7.30.14	They all transport water, minerals, and sugars produced through photosynthesis through the plant body in a similar manner.
7.30.15	All plant species also respond to environmental factors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation.
7.30.16	The Plant Body
7.30.17	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the shoot organ system and the root organ system Distinguish between meristematic tissue and permanent tissue Identify and describe the three regions where plant growth occurs Summarize the roles of dermal tissue, vascular tissue, and ground tissue Compare simple plant tissue with complex plant tissue
7.30.18	Like animals, plants contain cells with organelles in which specific metabolic activities take place.
7.30.19	Unlike animals, however, plants use energy from sunlight to form sugars during photosynthesis.
7.30.20	In addition, plant cells have cell walls, plastids, and a large central vacuole: structures that are not found in animal cells.
7.30.21	Each of these cellular structures plays a specific role in plant structure and function.
7.30.22	Plant Organ Systems
7.30.23	In plants, just as in animals, similar cells working together form a tissue.
7.30.24	When different types of tissues work together to perform a unique function, they form an organ; organs working together form organ systems.
7.30.25	Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system.
7.30.26	The shoot system consists of two portions: the vegetative (nonreproductive) parts of the plant, such as the leaves and the stems, and the reproductive parts of the plant, which include flowers and fruits.
7.30.27	The shoot system generally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis.
7.30.28	The root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground.
7.30.29	Figure 30.2 shows the organ systems of a typical plant.
7.30.30	The shoot system of a plant consists of leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits.
7.30.31	The root system anchors the plant while absorbing water and minerals from the soil.
7.30.32	Plant Tissues Plants are multicellular eukaryotes with tissue systems made of various cell types that carry out specific functions.
7.30.33	Plant tissue systems fall into one of two general types: meristematic tissue, and permanent (or non-meristematic) tissue.
7.30.34	Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems, which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth.
7.30.35	Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated, and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant.
7.30.36	In contrast, permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing.
7.30.37	Meristematic tissues consist of three types, based on their location in the plant.
7.30.38	Apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots, which enable a plant to extend in length.
7.30.39	Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant.
7.30.40	Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots, at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes (the areas where leaves attach to a stem).
7.30.41	This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the leaf base; for example, it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing.
7.30.42	Meristems produce cells that quickly differentiate, or specialize, and become permanent tissue.
7.30.43	Such cells take on specific roles and lose their ability to divide further.
7.30.44	They differentiate into three main types: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue.
7.30.45	Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant, and vascular tissue transports water, minerals, and sugars to different parts of the plant.
7.30.46	Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis, provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue, and helps to store water and sugars.
7.30.47	Secondary tissues are either simple (composed of similar cell types) or complex (composed of different cell types).
7.30.48	Dermal tissue, for example, is a simple tissue that covers the outer surface of the plant and controls gas exchange.
7.30.49	Vascular tissue is an example of a complex tissue, and is made of two specialized conducting tissues: xylem and phloem.
7.30.50	Xylem tissue transports water and nutrients from the roots to different parts of the plant, and includes three different cell types: vessel elements and tracheids (both of which conduct water), and xylem parenchyma.
7.30.51	Phloem tissue, which transports organic compounds from the site of photosynthesis to other parts of the plant, consists of four different cell types: sieve cells (which conduct photosynthates), companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers.
7.30.52	Unlike xylem conducting cells, phloem conducting cells are alive at maturity.
7.30.53	The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other (Figure 30.3).
7.30.54	In stems, the xylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle; in roots, this is termed the vascular stele or vascular cylinder.
7.30.55	This light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash (Curcurbita maxima) stem.
7.30.56	Each teardrop-shaped vascular bundle consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside.
7.30.57	Xylem cells, which transport water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant, are dead at functional maturity.
7.30.58	Phloem cells, which transport sugars and other organic compounds from photosynthetic tissue to the rest of the plant, are living.
7.30.59	The vascular bundles are encased in ground tissue and surrounded by dermal tissue.

7.30.62	stems
7.30.63	Stems are a part of the shoot system of a plant.
7.30.64	They may range in length from a few millimeters to hundreds of meters, and also vary in diameter, depending on the plant type.
7.30.65	Stems are usually above ground, although the stems of some plants, such as the potato, also grow underground.
7.30.66	Stems may be herbaceous (soft) or woody in nature.
7.30.67	Their main function is to provide support to the plant, holding leaves, flowers and buds; in some cases, stems also store food for the plant.
7.30.68	A stem may be unbranched, like that of a palm tree, or it may be highly branched, like that of a magnolia tree.
7.30.69	The stem of the plant connects the roots to the leaves, helping to transport absorbed water and minerals to different parts of the plant.
7.30.70	It also helps to transport the products of photosynthesis, namely sugars, from the leaves to the rest of the plant.
7.30.71	Plant stems, whether above or below ground, are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes (Figure 30.4).
7.30.72	Nodes are points of attachment for leaves, aerial roots, and flowers.
7.30.73	The stem region between two nodes is called an internode.
7.30.74	The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole.
7.30.75	An axillary bud is usually found in the axil—the area between the base of a leaf and the stem—where it can give rise to a branch or a flower.
7.30.76	The apex (tip) of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud.
7.30.77	Leaves are attached to the plant stem at areas called nodes.
7.30.78	An internode is the stem region between two nodes.
7.30.79	The petiole is the stalk connecting the leaf to the stem.
7.30.80	The leaves just above the nodes arose from axillary buds.
7.30.81	Stem Anatomy
7.30.82	The stem and other plant organs arise from the ground tissue, and are primarily made up of simple tissues formed from three types of cells: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells.
7.30.83	Parenchyma cells are the most common plant cells (Figure 30.5).
7.30.84	They are found in the stem, the root, the inside of the leaf, and the pulp of the fruit.
7.30.85	Parenchyma cells are responsible for metabolic functions, such as photosynthesis, and they help repair and heal wounds.
7.30.86	Some parenchyma cells also store starch.
7.30.87	The stem of common St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is shown in cross section in this light micrograph.
7.30.88	The central pith (greenish-blue, in the center) and peripheral cortex (narrow zone 3–5 cells thick just inside the epidermis) are composed of parenchyma cells.
7.30.89	Vascular tissue composed of xylem (red) and phloem tissue (green, between the xylem and cortex) surrounds the pith.
7.30.90	Collenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls (Figure 30.6).
7.30.91	They provide structural support, mainly to the stem and leaves.
7.30.92	These cells are alive at maturity and are usually found below the epidermis.
7.30.93	The “strings” of a celery stalk are an example of collenchyma cells.
7.30.94	Collenchyma cell walls are uneven in thickness, as seen in this light micrograph.
7.30.95	They provide support to plant structures.
7.30.96	Sclerenchyma cells also provide support to the plant, but unlike collenchyma cells, many of them are dead at maturity.
7.30.97	There are two types of sclerenchyma cells: fibers and sclereids.
7.30.98	Both types have secondary cell walls that are thickened with deposits of lignin, an organic compound that is a key component of wood.
7.30.99	Fibers are long, slender cells; sclereids are smaller-sized.
7.30.100	Sclereids give pears their gritty texture.
7.30.101	Humans use sclerenchyma fibers to make linen and rope.
7.30.102	Like the rest of the plant, the stem has three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue.
7.30.103	Each is distinguished by characteristic cell types that perform specific tasks necessary for the plant’s growth and survival.
7.30.104	Dermal Tissue
7.30.105	The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis, a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue.
7.30.106	Woody plants have a tough, waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark, which further protects the plant from damage.
7.30.107	Epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis.
7.30.108	The epidermis of a leaf also contains openings known as stomata, through which the exchange of gases takes place (Figure 30.8).
7.30.109	Two cells, known as guard cells, surround each leaf stoma, controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor.
7.30.110	Trichomes are hair-like structures on the epidermal surface.
7.30.111	They help to reduce transpiration (the loss of water by aboveground plant parts), increase solar reflectance, and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores.
7.30.112	Openings called stomata (singular: stoma) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor.
7.30.113	The (a) colorized scanning-electron micrograph shows a closed stoma of a dicot.
7.30.114	Each stoma is flanked by two guard cells that regulate its (b) opening and closing.
7.30.115	The (c) guard cells sit within the layer of epidermal cells.
7.30.116	Vascular Tissue
7.30.117	The xylem and phloem that make up the vascular tissue of the stem are arranged in distinct strands called vascular bundles, which run up and down the length of the stem.
7.30.118	When the stem is viewed in cross section, the vascular bundles of dicot stems are arranged in a ring.
7.30.119	In plants with stems that live for more than one year, the individual bundles grow together and produce the characteristic growth rings.
7.30.120	In monocot stems, the vascular bundles are randomly scattered throughout the ground tissue.
7.30.121	In (a) dicot stems, vascular bundles are arranged around the periphery of the ground tissue.
7.30.122	The xylem tissue is located toward the interior of the vascular bundle, and phloem is located toward the exterior.
7.30.123	Sclerenchyma fibers cap the vascular bundles.
7.30.124	In (b) monocot stems, vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem tissues are scattered throughout the ground tissue.
7.30.125	Xylem tissue has three types of cells: xylem parenchyma, tracheids, and vessel elements.
7.30.126	The latter two types conduct water and are dead at maturity.
7.30.127	Tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified.
7.30.128	Water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits, where secondary walls are absent.
7.30.129	Vessel elements are xylem cells with thinner walls; they are shorter than tracheids.
7.30.130	Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate at the end walls of the element.
7.30.131	Water moves through the perforation plates to travel up the plant.
7.30.132	Phloem tissue is composed of sieve-tube cells, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers.
7.30.133	A series of sievetube cells (also called sieve-tube elements) are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube, which transports organic substances such as sugars and amino acids.
7.30.134	The sugars flow from one sieve-tube cell to the next through perforated sieve plates, which are found at the end junctions between two cells.
7.30.135	Although still alive at maturity, the nucleus and other cell components of the sieve-tube cells have disintegrated.
7.30.136	Companion cells are found alongside the sieve-tube cells, providing them with metabolic support.
7.30.137	The companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sieve-tube cells, which lack some cellular organelles.
7.30.138	Ground Tissue Ground tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells, but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells that help support the stem.
7.30.139	The ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is known as pith, while the layer of tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex.
7.30.140	Growth in Stems Growth in plants occurs as the stems and roots lengthen.
7.30.141	Some plants, especially those that are woody, also increase in thickness during their life span.
7.30.142	The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth, and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem.
7.30.143	Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant, and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem.
7.30.144	Figure 30.10 shows the areas of primary and secondary growth in a plant.
7.30.145	Herbaceous plants mostly undergo primary growth, with hardly any secondary growth or increase in thickness.
7.30.146	Secondary growth or “wood” is noticeable in woody plants; it occurs in some dicots, but occurs very rarely in monocots.
7.30.147	In woody plants, primary growth is followed by secondary growth, which allows the plant stem to increase in thickness or girth.
7.30.148	Secondary vascular tissue is added as the plant grows, as well as a cork layer.
7.30.149	The bark of a tree extends from the vascular cambium to the epidermis.
7.30.150	Some plant parts, such as stems and roots, continue to grow throughout a plant’s life: a phenomenon called indeterminate growth.
7.30.151	Other plant parts, such as leaves and flowers, exhibit determinate growth, which ceases when a plant part reaches a particular size.
7.30.152	Primary Growth
7.30.153	Most primary growth occurs at the apices, or tips, of stems and roots.
7.30.154	Primary growth is a result of rapidly dividing cells in the apical meristems at the shoot tip and root tip.
7.30.155	Subsequent cell elongation also contributes to primary growth.
7.30.156	The growth of shoots and roots during primary growth enables plants to continuously seek water (roots) or sunlight (shoots).
7.30.157	The influence of the apical bud on overall plant growth is known as apical dominance, which diminishes the growth of axillary buds that form along the sides of branches and stems.
7.30.158	Most coniferous trees exhibit strong apical dominance, thus producing the typical conical Christmas tree shape.
7.30.159	If the apical bud is removed, then the axillary buds will start forming lateral branches.
7.30.160	Gardeners make use of this fact when they prune plants by cutting off the tops of branches, thus encouraging the axillary buds to grow out, giving the plant a bushy shape.
7.30.161	Secondary Growth
7.30.162	The increase in stem thickness that results from secondary growth is due to the activity of the lateral meristems, which are lacking in herbaceous plants.
7.30.163	Lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and, in woody plants, the cork cambium (see Figure 30.10).
7.30.164	The vascular cambium is located just outside the primary xylem and to the interior of the primary phloem.
7.30.165	The cells of the vascular cambium divide and form secondary xylem (tracheids and vessel elements) to the inside, and secondary phloem (sieve elements and companion cells) to the outside.
7.30.166	The thickening of the stem that occurs in secondary growth is due to the formation of secondary phloem and secondary xylem by the vascular cambium, plus the action of cork cambium, which forms the tough outermost layer of the stem.
7.30.167	The cells of the secondary xylem contain lignin, which provides hardiness and strength.
7.30.168	In woody plants, cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem.
7.30.169	It produces cork cells (bark) containing a waxy substance known as suberin that can repel water.
7.30.170	The bark protects the plant against physical damage and helps reduce water loss.
7.30.171	The cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm, which grows inward from the cambium.
7.30.172	The cork cambium, cork cells, and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm.
7.30.173	The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants.
7.30.174	In some plants, the periderm has many openings, known as lenticels, which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere (Figure 30.11).
7.30.175	This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex, xylem and phloem.
7.30.176	Lenticels on the bark of this cherry tree enable the woody stem to exchange gases with the surrounding atmosphere.
7.30.177	Annual Rings
7.30.178	The activity of the vascular cambium gives rise to annual growth rings.
7.30.179	During the spring growing season, cells of the secondary xylem have a large internal diameter and their primary cell walls are not extensively thickened.
7.30.180	This is known as early wood, or spring wood.
7.30.181	During the fall season, the secondary xylem develops thickened cell walls, forming late wood, or autumn wood, which is denser than early wood.
7.30.182	This alternation of early and late wood is due largely to a seasonal decrease in the number of vessel elements and a seasonal increase in the number of tracheids.
7.30.183	It results in the formation of an annual ring, which can be seen as a circular ring in the cross section of the stem (Figure 30.12).
7.30.184	An examination of the number of annual rings and their nature (such as their size and cell wall thickness) can reveal the age of the tree and the prevailing climatic conditions during each season.
7.30.185	The rate of wood growth increases in summer and decreases in winter, producing a characteristic ring for each year of growth.
7.30.186	Seasonal changes in weather patterns can also affect the growth rate
7.30.187	—note how the rings vary in thickness.
7.30.188	Stem Modifications
7.30.189	Some plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment (Figure 30.13).
7.30.190	A rhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes.
7.30.191	Vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants, such as ginger and ferns.
7.30.192	Corms are similar to rhizomes, except they are more rounded and fleshy (such as in gladiolus).
7.30.193	Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter.
7.30.194	Stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground, or just below the surface, and can give rise to new plants at the nodes.
7.30.195	Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals: strawberries are an example.
7.30.196	Tubers are modified stems that may store starch, as seen in the potato (Solanum sp.).
7.30.197	Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons, and contain many adventitious or unusual buds (familiar to us as the “eyes” on potatoes).
7.30.198	A bulb, which functions as an underground storage unit, is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem, as seen in the iris.
7.30.199	Stem modifications enable plants to thrive in a variety of environments.
7.30.200	Shown are (a) ginger (Zingiber officinale) rhizomes, (b) a carrion flower (Amorphophallus titanum) corm
7.30.201	(c) Rhodes grass
7.30.202	(Chloris gayana) stolons, (d) strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) runners, (e) potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers, and (f) red onion (Allium) bulbs.
7.30.203	Some aerial modifications of stems are tendrils and thorns (Figure 30.14).
7.30.204	Tendrils are slender, twining strands that enable a plant (like a vine or pumpkin) to seek support by climbing on other surfaces.
7.30.205	Thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant; common examples include roses, Osage orange and devil’s walking stick.
7.30.206	Found in southeastern United States, (a) buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata) is a weedy plant that climbs with the aid of tendrils.
7.30.207	This one is shown climbing up a wooden stake.
7.30.208	(b) Thorns are modified branches.
7.30.209	Roots
7.30.210	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify the two types of root systems Describe the three zones of the root tip and summarize the role of each zone in root growth Describe the structure of the root List and describe examples of modified roots
7.30.211	The roots of seed plants have three major functions: anchoring the plant to the soil, absorbing water and minerals and transporting them upwards, and storing the products of photosynthesis.
7.30.212	Some roots are modified to absorb moisture and exchange gases.
7.30.213	Most roots are underground.
7.30.214	Some plants, however, also have adventitious roots, which emerge above the ground from the shoot.
7.30.215	Types of Root Systems Root systems are mainly of two types (Figure 30.15).
7.30.216	Dicots have a tap root system, while monocots have a fibrous root system.
7.30.217	A tap root system has a main root that grows down vertically, and from which many smaller lateral roots arise.
7.30.218	Dandelions are a good example; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds, and they can regrow another shoot from the remaining root).
7.30.219	A tap root system penetrates deep into the soil.
7.30.220	In contrast, a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil surface, and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion (lawn grasses are a good example, as are wheat, rice, and corn).
7.30.221	Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots.
7.30.222	Plants that grow in dry areas often have deep root systems, whereas plants growing in areas with abundant water are likely to have shallower root systems.
7.30.223	(a) Tap root systems have a main root that grows down, while (b) fibrous root systems consist of many small roots.
7.30.224	Root Growth and Anatomy Root growth begins with seed germination.
7.30.225	When the plant embryo emerges from the seed, the radicle of the embryo forms the root system.
7.30.226	The tip of the root is protected by the root cap, a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure.
7.30.227	The root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil.
7.30.228	The root tip can be divided into three zones: a zone of cell division, a zone of elongation, and a zone of maturation and differentiation (Figure 30.16).
7.30.229	The zone of cell division is closest to the root tip; it is made up of the actively dividing cells of the root meristem.
7.30.230	The zone of elongation is where the newly formed cells increase in length, thereby lengthening the root.
7.30.231	Beginning at the first root hair is the zone of cell maturation where the root cells begin to differentiate into special cell types.
7.30.232	All three zones are in the first centimeter or so of the root tip.
7.30.233	A longitudinal view of the root reveals the zones of cell division, elongation, and maturation.
7.30.234	Cell division occurs in the apical meristem.
7.30.235	The root has an outer layer of cells called the epidermis, which surrounds areas of ground tissue and vascular tissue.
7.30.236	The epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption.
7.30.237	Root hairs, which are extensions of root epidermal cells, increase the surface area of the root, greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals.
7.30.238	Inside the root, the ground tissue forms two regions: the cortex and the pith (Figure 30.17).
7.30.239	Compared to stems, roots have lots of cortex and little pith.
7.30.240	Both regions include cells that store photosynthetic products.
7.30.241	The cortex is between the epidermis and the vascular tissue, whereas the pith lies between the vascular tissue and the center of the root.
7.30.242	Staining reveals different cell types in this light micrograph of a wheat (Triticum) root cross section.
7.30.243	Sclerenchyma cells of the exodermis and xylem cells stain red, and phloem cells stain blue.
7.30.244	Other cell types stain black.
7.30.245	The stele, or vascular tissue, is the area inside endodermis (indicated by a green ring).
7.30.246	Root hairs are visible outside the epidermis.
7.30.247	The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root, which is called the stele (Figure 30.18).
7.30.248	A layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root.
7.30.249	The endodermis is exclusive to roots, and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root’s vascular system.
7.30.250	A waxy substance called suberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells.
7.30.251	This waxy region, known as the Casparian strip, forces water and solutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells.
7.30.252	This ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis, while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded.
7.30.253	The outermost cell layer of the root’s vascular tissue is the pericycle, an area that can give rise to lateral roots.
7.30.254	In dicot roots, the xylem and phloem of the stele are arranged alternately in an X shape, whereas in monocot roots, the vascular tissue is arranged in a ring around the pith.
7.30.255	In (left) typical dicots, the vascular tissue forms an X shape in the center of the root.
7.30.256	In (right) typical monocots, the phloem cells and the larger xylem cells form a characteristic ring around the central pith.
7.30.257	Root Modifications Root structures may be modified for specific purposes.
7.30.258	For example, some roots are bulbous and store starch.
7.30.259	Aerial roots and prop roots are two forms of aboveground roots that provide additional support to anchor the plant.
7.30.260	Tap roots, such as carrots, turnips, and beets, are examples of roots that are modified for food storage.
7.30.261	Many vegetables are modified roots.
7.30.262	Epiphytic roots enable a plant to grow on another plant.
7.30.263	For example, the epiphytic roots of orchids develop a spongy tissue to absorb moisture.
7.30.264	The banyan tree (Ficus sp.) begins as an epiphyte, germinating in the branches of a host tree; aerial roots develop from the branches and eventually reach the ground, providing additional support (Figure 30.20).
7.30.265	In screwpine (Pandanus sp.), a palm-like tree that grows in sandy tropical soils, aboveground prop roots develop from the nodes to provide additional support.
7.30.266	The (a) banyan tree, also known as the strangler fig, begins life as an epiphyte in a host tree.
7.30.267	Aerial roots extend to the ground and support the growing plant, which eventually strangles the host tree.
7.30.268	The (b) screwpine develops aboveground roots that help support the plant in sandy soils.
7.30.269	Leaves
7.30.270	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify the parts of a typical leaf Describe the internal structure and function of a leaf Compare and contrast simple leaves and compound leaves List and describe examples of modified leaves Leaves are the main sites for photosynthesis: the process by which plants synthesize food.
7.30.271	Most leaves are usually green, due to the presence of chlorophyll in the leaf cells.
7.30.272	However, some leaves may have different colors, caused by other plant pigments that mask the green chlorophyll.
7.30.273	The thickness, shape, and size of leaves are adapted to the environment.
7.30.274	Each variation helps a plant species maximize its chances of survival in a particular habitat.
7.30.275	Usually, the leaves of plants growing in tropical rainforests have larger surface areas than those of plants growing in deserts or very cold conditions, which are likely to have a smaller surface area to minimize water loss.
7.30.276	Structure of a Typical Leaf
7.30.277	Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina, which is also the widest part of the leaf.
7.30.278	Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole.
7.30.279	Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves.
7.30.280	Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules.
7.30.281	Most leaves have a midrib, which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue.
7.30.282	The edge of the leaf is called the margin.
7.30.283	Figure 30.21 shows the structure of a typical eudicot leaf.
7.30.284	Deceptively simple in appearance, a leaf is a highly efficient structure.
7.30.285	Within each leaf, the vascular tissue forms veins.
7.30.286	The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern.
7.30.287	Monocots and dicots differ in their patterns of venation (Figure 30.22).
7.30.288	Monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight lines across the length of the leaf without converging at a point.
7.30.289	In dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like appearance, forming a pattern known as reticulate venation.
7.30.290	One extant plant, the Ginkgo biloba, has dichotomous venation where the veins fork.
7.30.291	(a) Tulip (Tulipa), a monocot, has leaves with parallel venation.
7.30.292	The netlike venation in this (b) linden (Tilia cordata) leaf distinguishes it as a dicot.
7.30.293	The (c) Ginkgo biloba tree has dichotomous venation.
7.30.294	Leaf Arrangement
7.30.295	The arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as phyllotaxy.
7.30.296	The number and placement of a plant’s leaves will vary depending on the species, with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement.
7.30.297	Leaves are classified as either alternate, spiral, or opposite.
7.30.298	Plants that have only one leaf per node have leaves that are said to be either alternate—meaning the leaves alternate on each side of the stem in a flat plane—or spiral, meaning the leaves are arrayed in a spiral along the stem.
7.30.299	In an opposite leaf arrangement, two leaves arise at the same point, with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch.
7.30.300	If there are three or more leaves connected at a node, the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled.
7.30.301	Leaf Form Leaves may be simple or compound (Figure 30.23).
7.30.302	In a simple leaf, the blade is either completely undivided—as in the banana leaf—or it has lobes, but the separation does not reach the midrib, as in the maple leaf.
7.30.303	In a compound leaf, the leaf blade is completely divided, forming leaflets, as in the locust tree.
7.30.304	Each leaflet may have its own stalk, but is attached to the rachis.
7.30.305	A palmately compound leaf resembles the palm of a hand, with leaflets radiating outwards from one point Examples include the leaves of poison ivy, the buckeye tree, or the familiar houseplant Schefflera sp.
7.30.306	(common name “umbrella plant”).
7.30.307	Pinnately compound leaves take their name from their feather-like appearance; the leaflets are arranged along the midrib, as in rose leaves (Rosa sp.), or the leaves of hickory, pecan, ash, or walnut trees.  
7.30.308	Leaves may be simple or compound.
7.30.309	In simple leaves, the lamina is continuous.
7.30.310	The (a) banana plant (Musa sp.) has simple leaves.
7.30.311	In compound leaves, the lamina is separated into leaflets.
7.30.312	Compound leaves may be palmate or pinnate.
7.30.313	In (b) palmately compound leaves, such as those of the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), the leaflets branch from the petiole.
7.30.314	In (c) pinnately compound leaves, the leaflets branch from the midrib, as on a scrub hickory (Carya floridana).
7.30.315	The (d) honey locust has double compound leaves, in which leaflets branch from the veins.
7.30.316	Leaf Structure and Function
7.30.317	The outermost layer of the leaf is the epidermis; it is present on both sides of the leaf and is called the upper and lower epidermis, respectively.
7.30.318	Botanists call the upper side the adaxial surface (or adaxis) and the lower side the abaxial surface (or abaxis).
7.30.319	The epidermis helps in the regulation of gas exchange.
7.30.320	It contains stomata (Figure 30.24): openings through which the exchange of gases takes place.
7.30.321	Two guard cells surround each stoma, regulating its opening and closing.
7.30.322	Visualized at 500x with a scanning electron microscope, several stomata are clearly visible on (a) the surface of this sumac (Rhus glabra) leaf.
7.30.323	At 5,000x magnification, the guard cells of (b) a single stoma from lyre-leaved sand cress (Arabidopsis lyrata) have the appearance of lips that surround the opening.
7.30.324	In this (c) light micrograph cross-section of an A. lyrata leaf, the guard cell pair is visible along with the large, sub-stomatal air space in the leaf.
7.30.325	The epidermis is usually one cell layer thick; however, in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions, the epidermis may be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration.
7.30.326	A waxy layer known as the cuticle covers the leaves of all plant species.
7.30.327	The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface.
7.30.328	Other leaves may have small hairs (trichomes) on the leaf surface.
7.30.329	Trichomes help to deter herbivory by restricting insect movements, or by storing toxic or bad-tasting compounds; they can also reduce the rate of transpiration by blocking air flow across the leaf surface.
7.30.330	Trichomes give leaves a fuzzy appearance as in this (a) sundew (Drosera sp.).
7.30.331	Leaf trichomes include (b) branched trichomes on the leaf of Arabidopsis lyrata and (c) multibranched trichomes on a mature Quercus marilandica leaf.
7.30.332	Below the epidermis of dicot leaves are layers of cells known as the mesophyll, or “middle leaf.
7.30.333	”
7.30.334	The mesophyll of most leaves typically contains two arrangements of parenchyma cells: the palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma (Figure 30.26).
7.30.335	The palisade parenchyma (also called the palisade mesophyll) has column-shaped, tightly packed cells, and may be present in one, two, or three layers.
7.30.336	Below the palisade parenchyma are loosely arranged cells of an irregular shape.
7.30.337	These are the cells of the spongy parenchyma (or spongy mesophyll).
7.30.338	The air space found between the spongy parenchyma cells allows gaseous exchange between the leaf and the outside atmosphere through the stomata.
7.30.339	In aquatic plants, the intercellular spaces in the spongy parenchyma help the leaf float.
7.30.340	Both layers of the mesophyll contain many chloroplasts.
7.30.341	Guard cells are the only epidermal cells to contain chloroplasts.
7.30.342	In the (a) leaf drawing, the central mesophyll is sandwiched between an upper and lower epidermis.
7.30.343	The mesophyll has two layers: an upper palisade layer comprised of tightly packed, columnar cells, and a lower spongy layer, comprised of loosely packed, irregularly shaped cells.
7.30.344	Stomata on the leaf underside allow gas exchange.
7.30.345	A waxy cuticle covers all aerial surfaces of land plants to minimize water loss.
7.30.346	These leaf layers are clearly visible in the (b) scanning electron micrograph.
7.30.347	The numerous small bumps in the palisade parenchyma cells are chloroplasts.
7.30.348	Chloroplasts are also present in the spongy parenchyma, but are not as obvious.
7.30.349	The bumps protruding from the lower surface of the leave are glandular trichomes, which differ in structure from the stalked trichomes in Figure 30.25.
7.30.350	Like the stem, the leaf contains vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem (Figure 30.27).
7.30.351	The xylem consists of tracheids and vessels, which transport water and minerals to the leaves.
7.30.352	The phloem transports the photosynthetic products from the leaf to the other parts of the plant.
7.30.353	A single vascular bundle, no matter how large or small, always contains both xylem and phloem tissues.
7.30.354	This scanning electron micrograph shows xylem and phloem in the leaf vascular bundle from the lyreleaved sand cress (Arabidopsis lyrata).
7.30.355	Leaf Adaptations Coniferous plant species that thrive in cold environments, like spruce, fir, and pine, have leaves that are reduced in size and needle-like in appearance.
7.30.356	These needle-like leaves have sunken stomata and a smaller surface area: two attributes that aid in reducing water loss.
7.30.357	In hot climates, plants such as cacti have leaves that are reduced to spines, which in combination with their succulent stems, help to conserve water.
7.30.358	Many aquatic plants have leaves with wide lamina that can float on the surface of the water, and a thick waxy cuticle on the leaf surface that repels water.
7.30.359	Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants
7.30.360	By the end of this section, you will be able to:
7.30.361	Define water potential and explain how it is influenced by solutes, pressure, gravity, and the matric potential Describe how water potential, evapotranspiration, and stomatal regulation influence how water is transported in plants
7.30.362	Explain how photosynthates are transported in plants
7.30.363	The structure of plant roots, stems, and leaves facilitates the transport of water, nutrients, and photosynthates throughout the plant.
7.30.364	The phloem and xylem are the main tissues responsible for this movement.
7.30.365	Water potential, evapotranspiration, and stomatal regulation influence how water and nutrients are transported in plants.
7.30.366	To understand how these processes work, we must first understand the energetics of water potential.
7.30.367	Water Potential Plants are phenomenal hydraulic engineers.
7.30.368	Using only the basic laws of physics and the simple manipulation of potential energy, plants can move water to the top of a 116-meter-tall tree (Figure 30.31a).
7.30.369	Plants can also use hydraulics to generate enough force to split rocks and buckle sidewalks
7.30.370	(Figure 30.31b).
7.30.371	Plants achieve this because of water potential.
7.30.372	With heights nearing 116 meters, (a) coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) are the tallest trees in the world.
7.30.373	Plant roots can easily generate enough force to (b) buckle and break concrete sidewalks, much to the dismay of homeowners and city maintenance departments.
7.30.374	Water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water.
7.30.375	Plant physiologists are not interested in the energy in any one particular aqueous system, but are very interested in water movement between two systems.
7.30.376	In practical terms, therefore, water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water (at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature).
7.30.377	Water potential is denoted by the Greek letter ψ (psi) and is expressed in units of pressure (pressure is a form of energy) called megapascals (MPa).
7.30.378	The potential of pure water (Ψw pure H2O) is, by convenience of definition, designated a value of zero (even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy, that energy is ignored).
7.30.379	Water potential values for the water in a plant root, stem, or leaf are therefore expressed relative to Ψw pure H2O.
7.30.380	The water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and factors called matrix effects.
7.30.381	Water potential can be broken down into its individual components using the following equation: Ψsystem =
7.30.382	Ψtotal =
7.30.383	Ψs + Ψp + Ψg + Ψm where Ψs, Ψp, Ψg, and Ψm refer to the solute, pressure, gravity, and matric potentials, respectively.
7.30.384	“
7.30.385	System” can refer to the water potential of the soil water (Ψsoil), root water (Ψroot), stem water (Ψstem), leaf water (Ψleaf) or the water in the atmosphere (Ψatmosphere): whichever aqueous system is under consideration.
7.30.386	As the individual components change, they raise or lower the total water potential of a system.
7.30.387	When this happens, water moves to equilibrate, moving from the system or compartment with a higher water potential to the system or compartment with a lower water potential.
7.30.388	This brings the difference in water potential between the two systems (ΔΨ) back to zero (ΔΨ = 0).
7.30.389	Therefore, for water to move through the plant from the soil to the air (a process called transpiration), Ψsoil must be >
7.30.390	Ψroot >
7.30.391	Ψstem >
7.30.392	Ψleaf > Ψatmosphere.
7.30.393	Water only moves in response to ΔΨ, not in response to the individual components.
7.30.394	However, because the individual components influence the total Ψsystem, by manipulating the individual components (especially Ψs), a plant can control water movement.
7.30.395	Solute Potential Solute potential (Ψs), also called osmotic potential, is negative in a plant cell and zero in distilled water.
7.30.396	Typical values for cell cytoplasm are –0.5 to –1.0 MPa.
7.30.397	Solutes reduce water potential (resulting in a negative Ψw) by consuming some of the potential energy available in the water.
7.30.398	Solute molecules can dissolve in water because water molecules can bind to them via hydrogen bonds; a hydrophobic molecule like oil, which cannot bind to water, cannot go into solution.
7.30.399	The energy in the hydrogen bonds between solute molecules and water is no longer available to do work in the system because it is tied up in the bond.
7.30.400	In other words, the amount of available potential energy is reduced when solutes are added to an aqueous system.
7.30.401	Thus, Ψs decreases with increasing solute concentration.
7.30.402	Because Ψs is one of the four components of Ψsystem or Ψtotal, a decrease in Ψs will cause a decrease in Ψtotal.
7.30.403	The internal water potential of a plant cell is more negative than pure water because of the cytoplasm’s high solute content (Figure 30.32).
7.30.404	Because of this difference in water potential water will move from the soil into a plant’s root cells via the process of osmosis.
7.30.405	This is why solute potential is sometimes called osmotic potential.
7.30.406	Plant cells can metabolically manipulate Ψs (and by extension, Ψtotal) by adding or removing solute molecules.
7.30.407	Therefore, plants have control over Ψtotal via their ability to exert metabolic control over Ψs.
7.30.408	Pressure Potential Pressure potential (Ψp), also called turgor potential, may be positive or negative (Figure 30.32).
7.30.409	Because pressure is an expression of energy, the higher the pressure, the more potential energy in a system, and vice versa.
7.30.410	Therefore, a positive Ψp (compression) increases Ψtotal, and a negative Ψp (tension) decreases Ψtotal.
7.30.411	Positive pressure inside cells is contained by the cell wall, producing turgor pressure.
7.30.412	Pressure potentials are typically around 0.6–0.8 MPa, but can reach as high as 1.5 MPa in a well-watered plant.
7.30.413	A Ψp of 1.5 MPa equates to 210 pounds per square inch (1.5 MPa x 140 lb in-2 MPa-1
7.30.414	= 210 lb/in-2).
7.30.415	As a comparison, most automobile tires are kept at a pressure of 30–34 psi.
7.30.416	An example of the effect of turgor pressure is the wilting of leaves and their restoration after the plant has been watered (Figure 30.33).
7.30.417	Water is lost from the leaves via transpiration (approaching Ψp = 0 MPa at the wilting point) and restored by uptake via the roots.
7.30.418	A plant can manipulate Ψp via its ability to manipulate Ψs and by the process of osmosis.
7.30.419	If a plant cell increases the cytoplasmic solute concentration,
7.30.420	Ψs will decline, Ψtotal will decline, the ΔΨ between the cell and the surrounding tissue will decline, water will move into the cell by osmosis, and Ψp will increase.
7.30.421	Ψp is also under indirect plant control via the opening and closing of stomata.
7.30.422	Stomatal openings allow water to evaporate from the leaf, reducing Ψp and Ψtotal of the leaf and increasing ii between the water in the leaf and the petiole, thereby allowing water to flow from the petiole into the leaf.
7.30.423	When (a) total water potential (Ψtotal) is lower outside the cells than inside, water moves out of the cells and the plant wilts.
7.30.424	When (b) the total water potential is higher outside the plant cells than inside, water moves into the cells, resulting in turgor pressure (Ψp) and keeping the plant erect.
7.30.425	Gravity Potential Gravity potential (Ψg) is always negative to zero in a plant with no height.
7.30.426	It always removes or consumes potential energy from the system.
7.30.427	The force of gravity pulls water downwards to the soil, reducing the total amount of potential energy in the water in the plant (Ψtotal).
7.30.428	The taller the plant, the taller the water column, and the more influential Ψg becomes.
7.30.429	On a cellular scale and in short plants, this effect is negligible and easily ignored.
7.30.430	However, over the height of a tall tree like a giant coastal redwood, the gravitational pull of –0.1 MPa m-1 is equivalent to an extra 1 MPa of resistance that must be overcome for water to reach the leaves of the tallest trees.
7.30.431	Plants are unable to manipulate Ψg.
7.30.432	Matric Potential Matric potential (Ψm) is always negative to zero.
7.30.433	In a dry system, it can be as low as –2 MPa in a dry seed, and it is zero in a water-saturated system.
7.30.434	The binding of water to a matrix always removes or consumes potential energy from the system.
7.30.435	Ψm is similar to solute potential because it involves tying up the energy in an aqueous system by forming hydrogen bonds between the water and some other component.
7.30.436	However, in solute potential, the other components are soluble, hydrophilic solute molecules, whereas in Ψm, the other components are insoluble, hydrophilic molecules of the plant cell wall.
7.30.437	Every plant cell has a cellulosic cell wall and the cellulose in the cell walls is hydrophilic, producing a matrix for adhesion of water: hence the name matric potential.
7.30.438	Ψm is very large (negative) in dry tissues such as seeds or drought-affected soils.
7.30.439	However, it quickly goes to zero as the seed takes up water or the soil hydrates.
7.30.440	Ψm cannot be manipulated by the plant and is typically ignored in well-watered roots, stems, and leaves.
7.30.441	Movement of Water and Minerals in the Xylem Solutes, pressure, gravity, and matric potential are all important for the transport of water in plants.
7.30.442	Water moves from an area of higher total water potential (higher Gibbs free energy) to an area of lower total water potential.
7.30.443	Gibbs free energy is the energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work.
7.30.444	This is expressed as ΔΨ.
7.30.445	Transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface.
7.30.446	It is the main driver of water movement in the xylem.
7.30.447	Transpiration is caused by the evaporation of water at the leaf–atmosphere interface; it creates negative pressure (tension) equivalent to –2 MPa at the leaf surface.
7.30.448	This value varies greatly depending on the vapor pressure deficit, which can be negligible at high relative humidity (RH) and substantial at low RH.
7.30.449	Water from the roots is pulled up by this tension.
7.30.450	At night, when stomata shut and transpiration stops, the water is held in the stem and leaf by the adhesion of water to the cell walls of the xylem vessels and tracheids, and the cohesion of water molecules to each other.
7.30.451	This is called the cohesion–tension theory of sap ascent.
7.30.452	Inside the leaf at the cellular level, water on the surface of mesophyll cells saturates the cellulose microfibrils of the primary cell wall.
7.30.453	The leaf contains many large intercellular air spaces for the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide, which is required for photosynthesis.
7.30.454	The wet cell wall is exposed to this leaf internal air space, and the water on the surface of the cells evaporates into the air spaces, decreasing the thin film on the surface of the mesophyll cells.
7.30.455	This decrease creates a greater tension on the water in the mesophyll cells (Figure 30.34), thereby increasing the pull on the water in the xylem vessels.
7.30.456	The xylem vessels and tracheids are structurally adapted to cope with large changes in pressure.
7.30.457	Rings in the vessels maintain their tubular shape, much like the rings on a vacuum cleaner hose keep the hose open while it is under pressure.
7.30.458	Small perforations between vessel elements reduce the number and size of gas bubbles that can form via a process called cavitation.
7.30.459	The formation of gas bubbles in xylem interrupts the continuous stream of water from the base to the top of the plant, causing a break termed an embolism in the flow of xylem sap.
7.30.460	The taller the tree, the greater the tension forces needed to pull water, and the more cavitation events.
7.30.461	In larger trees, the resulting embolisms can plug xylem vessels, making them non-functional.
7.30.462	Transpiration—
7.30.463	the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata—is a passive process, meaning that metabolic energy in the form of ATP is not required for water movement.
7.30.464	The energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere.
7.30.465	However, transpiration is tightly controlled.
7.30.466	Control of Transpiration
7.30.467	The atmosphere to which the leaf is exposed drives transpiration, but also causes massive water loss from the plant.
7.30.468	Up to 90 percent of the water taken up by roots may be lost through transpiration.
7.30.469	Leaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water.
7.30.470	Regulation of transpiration, therefore, is achieved primarily through the opening and closing of stomata on the leaf surface.
7.30.471	Stomata are surrounded by two specialized cells called guard cells, which open and close in response to environmental cues such as light intensity and quality, leaf water status, and carbon dioxide concentrations.
7.30.472	Stomata must open to allow air containing carbon dioxide and oxygen to diffuse into the leaf for photosynthesis and respiration.
7.30.473	When stomata are open, however, water vapor is lost to the external environment, increasing the rate of transpiration.
7.30.474	Therefore, plants must maintain a balance between efficient photosynthesis and water loss.
7.30.475	Plants have evolved over time to adapt to their local environment and reduce transpiration(Figure 30.35).
7.30.476	Desert plant (xerophytes) and plants that grow on other plants (epiphytes) have limited access to water.
7.30.477	Such plants usually have a much thicker waxy cuticle than those growing in more moderate, well-watered environments (mesophytes).
7.30.478	Aquatic plants (hydrophytes) also have their own set of anatomical and morphological leaf adaptations.
7.30.479	Plants are suited to their local environment.
7.30.480	(a)
7.30.481	Xerophytes, like this prickly pear cactus (Opuntia sp.)
7.30.482	and (b) epiphytes such as this tropical Aeschynanthus perrottetii have adapted to very limited water resources.
7.30.483	The leaves of a prickly pear are modified into spines, which lowers the surface-to-volume ratio and reduces water loss.
7.30.484	Photosynthesis takes place in the stem, which also stores water.
7.30.485	(b) A. perottetii leaves have a waxy cuticle that prevents water loss.
7.30.486	(c) Goldenrod (Solidago sp.) is a mesophyte, well suited for moderate environments.
7.30.487	(d) Hydrophytes, like this fragrant water lily (Nymphaea odorata), are adapted to thrive in aquatic environments.
7.30.488	Xerophytes and epiphytes often have a thick covering of trichomes or of stomata that are sunken below the leaf’s surface.
7.30.489	Trichomes are specialized hair-like epidermal cells that secrete oils and substances.
7.30.490	These adaptations impede air flow across the stomatal pore and reduce transpiration.
7.30.491	Multiple epidermal layers are also commonly found in these types of plants.
7.30.492	Transportation of Photosynthates in the Phloem Plants need an energy source to grow.
7.30.493	In seeds and bulbs, food is stored in polymers (such as starch) that are converted by metabolic processes into sucrose for newly developing plants.
7.30.494	Once green shoots and leaves are growing, plants are able to produce their own food by photosynthesizing.
7.30.495	The products of photosynthesis are called photosynthates, which are usually in the form of simple sugars such as sucrose.
7.30.496	Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources.
7.30.497	Sugars produced in sources, such as leaves, need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation.
7.30.498	The points of sugar delivery, such as roots, young shoots, and developing seeds, are called sinks.
7.30.499	Seeds, tubers, and bulbs can be either a source or a sink, depending on the plant’s stage of development and the season.
7.30.500	The products from the source are usually translocated to the nearest sink through the phloem.
7.30.501	For example, the highest leaves will send photosynthates upward to the growing shoot tip, whereas lower leaves will direct photosynthates downward to the roots.
7.30.502	Intermediate leaves will send products in both directions, unlike the flow in the xylem, which is always unidirectional (soil to leaf to atmosphere).
7.30.503	The pattern of photosynthate flow changes as the plant grows and develops.
7.30.504	Photosynthates are directed primarily to the roots early on, to shoots and leaves during vegetative growth, and to seeds and fruits during reproductive development.
7.30.505	They are also directed to tubers for storage.
7.30.506	Translocation: Transport from Source to Sink Photosynthates, such as sucrose, are produced in the mesophyll cells of photosynthesizing leaves.
7.30.507	From there they are translocated through the phloem to where they are used or stored.
7.30.508	Mesophyll cells are connected by cytoplasmic channels called plasmodesmata.
7.30.509	Photosynthates move through these channels to reach phloem sieve-tube elements (STEs) in the vascular bundles.
7.30.510	From the mesophyll cells, the photosynthates are loaded into the phloem STEs.
7.30.511	The sucrose is actively transported against its concentration gradient (a process requiring ATP) into the phloem cells using the electrochemical potential of the proton gradient.
7.30.512	This is coupled to the uptake of sucrose with a carrier protein called the sucrose-H+ symporter.
7.30.513	Phloem STEs have reduced cytoplasmic contents, and are connected by a sieve plate with pores that allow for pressuredriven bulk flow, or translocation, of phloem sap.
7.30.514	Companion cells are associated with STEs.
7.30.515	They assist with metabolic activities and produce energy for the STEs.
7.30.516	Phloem is comprised of cells called sieve-tube elements.
7.30.517	Phloem sap travels through perforations called sieve tube plates.
7.30.518	Neighboring companion cells carry out metabolic functions for the sieve-tube elements and provide them with energy.
7.30.519	Lateral sieve areas connect the sieve-tube elements to the companion cells.
7.30.520	Once in the phloem, the photosynthates are translocated to the closest sink.
7.30.521	Phloem sap is an aqueous solution that contains up to 30 percent sugar, minerals, amino acids, and plant growth regulators.
7.30.522	The high percentage of sugar decreases Ψs, which decreases the total water potential and causes water to move by osmosis from the adjacent xylem into the phloem tubes, thereby increasing pressure.
7.30.523	This increase in total water potential causes the bulk flow of phloem from source to sink (Figure 30.37).
7.30.524	Sucrose concentration in the sink cells is lower than in the phloem STEs because the sink sucrose has been metabolized for growth, or converted to starch for storage or other polymers, such as cellulose, for structural integrity.
7.30.525	Unloading at the sink end of the phloem tube occurs by either diffusion or active transport of sucrose molecules from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration.
7.30.526	Water diffuses from the phloem by osmosis and is then transpired or recycled via the xylem back into the phloem sap.
7.30.527	Sucrose is actively transported from source cells into companion cells and then into the sieve-tube elements.
7.30.528	This reduces the water potential, which causes water to enter the phloem from the xylem.
7.30.529	The resulting positive pressure forces the sucrose-water mixture down toward the roots, where sucrose is unloaded.
7.30.530	Transpiration causes water to return to the leaves through the xylem vessels.
7.30.531	Plant Sensory Systems and Responses
7.30.532	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe how red and blue light affect plant growth and metabolic activities
7.30.533	Discuss gravitropism Understand how hormones affect plant growth and development Describe thigmotropism, thigmonastism, and thigmogenesis Explain how plants defend themselves from predators and respond to wounds Animals can respond to environmental factors by moving to a new location.
7.30.534	Plants, however, are rooted in place and must respond to the surrounding environmental factors.
7.30.535	Plants have sophisticated systems to detect and respond to light, gravity, temperature, and physical touch.
7.30.536	Receptors sense environmental factors and relay the information to effector systems—often through intermediate chemical messengers—to bring about plant responses.
7.30.537	Plant Responses to Light Plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low-molecularweight sugars using only carbon dioxide, light, and water.
7.30.538	Photomorphogenesis is the growth and development of plants in response to light.
7.30.539	It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space.
7.30.540	Photoperiodism is the ability to use light to track time.
7.30.541	Plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight.
7.30.542	Phototropism is a directional response that allows plants to grow towards, or even away from, light.
7.30.543	The sensing of light in the environment is important to plants; it can be crucial for competition and survival.
7.30.544	The response of plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors, which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a lightabsorbing pigment called a chromophore.
7.30.545	Together, the two are called a chromoprotein.
7.30.546	The red/far-red and violet-blue regions of the visible light spectrum trigger structural development in plants.
7.30.547	Sensory photoreceptors absorb light in these particular regions of the visible light spectrum because of the quality of light available in the daylight spectrum.
7.30.548	In terrestrial habitats, light absorption by chlorophylls peaks in the blue and red regions of the spectrum.
7.30.549	As light filters through the canopy and the blue and red wavelengths are absorbed, the spectrum shifts to the farred end, shifting the plant community to those plants better adapted to respond to far-red light.
7.30.550	Blue-light receptors allow plants to gauge the direction and abundance of sunlight, which is rich in blue–green emissions.
7.30.551	Water absorbs red light, which makes the detection of blue light essential for algae and aquatic plants.
7.30.552	The Phytochrome System and the Red/Far-Red Response
7.30.553	The phytochromes are a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore, similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole light-absorbing head group of chlorophyll.
7.30.554	Phytochromes have two photo-interconvertible forms: Pr and Pfr.
7.30.555	Pr absorbs red light (~667 nm) and is immediately converted to Pfr.
7.30.556	Pfr absorbs far-red light (~730 nm) and is quickly converted back to Pr.
7.30.557	Absorption of red or far-red light causes a massive change to the shape of the chromophore, altering the conformation and activity of the phytochrome protein to which it is bound.
7.30.558	Pfr is the physiologically active form of the protein; therefore, exposure to red light yields physiological activity.
7.30.559	Exposure to far-red light inhibits phytochrome activity.
7.30.560	Together, the two forms represent the phytochrome system (Figure 30.38).
7.30.561	The phytochrome system acts as a biological light switch.
7.30.562	It monitors the level, intensity, duration, and color of environmental light.
7.30.563	The effect of red light is reversible by immediately shining far-red light on the sample, which converts the chromoprotein to the inactive Pr form.
7.30.564	Additionally, Pfr can slowly revert to Pr in the dark, or break down over time.
7.30.565	In all instances, the physiological response induced by red light is reversed.
7.30.566	The active form of phytochrome (Pfr) can directly activate other molecules in the cytoplasm, or it can be trafficked to the nucleus, where it directly activates or represses specific gene expression.
7.30.567	Once the phytochrome system evolved, plants adapted it to serve a variety of needs.
7.30.568	Unfiltered, full sunlight contains much more red light than far-red light.
7.30.569	Because chlorophyll absorbs strongly in the red region of the visible spectrum, but not in the far-red region, any plant in the shade of another plant on the forest floor will be exposed to red-depleted, far-red-enriched light.
7.30.570	The preponderance of far-red light converts phytochrome in the shaded leaves to the Pr (inactive) form, slowing growth.
7.30.571	The nearest non-shaded (or even less-shaded) areas on the forest floor have more red light; leaves exposed to these areas sense the red light, which activates the Pfr form and induces growth.
7.30.572	In short, plant shoots use the phytochrome system to grow away from shade and towards light.
7.30.573	Because competition for light is so fierce in a dense plant community, the evolutionary advantages of the phytochrome system are obvious.
7.30.574	In seeds, the phytochrome system is not used to determine direction and quality of light (shaded versus unshaded).
7.30.575	Instead, is it used merely to determine if there is any light at all.
7.30.576	This is especially important in species with very small seeds, such as lettuce.
7.30.577	Because of their size, lettuce seeds have few food reserves.
7.30.578	Their seedlings cannot grow for long before they run out of fuel.
7.30.579	If they germinated even a centimeter under the soil surface, the seedling would never make it into the sunlight and would die.
7.30.580	In the dark, phytochrome is in the Pr (inactive form) and the seed will not germinate; it will only germinate if exposed to light at the surface of the soil.
7.30.581	Upon exposure to light, Pr is converted to Pfr and germination proceeds.
7.30.582	The biologically inactive form of phytochrome (Pr) is converted to the biologically active form Pfr under illumination with red light.
7.30.583	Far-red light and darkness convert the molecule back to the inactive form.
7.30.584	Plants also use the phytochrome system to sense the change of season.
7.30.585	Photoperiodism is a biological response to the timing and duration of day and night.
7.30.586	It controls flowering, setting of winter buds, and vegetative growth.
7.30.587	Detection of seasonal changes is crucial to plant survival.
7.30.588	Although temperature and light intensity influence plant growth, they are not reliable indicators of season because they may vary from one year to the next.
7.30.589	Day length is a better indicator of the time of year.
7.30.590	As stated above, unfiltered sunlight is rich in red light but deficient in far-red light.
7.30.591	Therefore, at dawn, all the phytochrome molecules in a leaf quickly convert to the active Pfr form, and remain in that form until sunset.
7.30.592	In the dark, the Pfr form takes hours to slowly revert back to the Pr form.
7.30.593	If the night is long (as in winter), all of the Pfr form reverts.
7.30.594	If the night is short (as in summer), a considerable amount of Pfr may remain at sunrise.
7.30.595	By sensing the Pr/Pfr ratio at dawn, a plant can determine the length of the day/night cycle.
7.30.596	In addition, leaves retain that information for several days, allowing a comparison between the length of the previous night and the preceding several nights.
7.30.597	Shorter nights indicate springtime to the plant; when the nights become longer, autumn is approaching.
7.30.598	This information, along with sensing temperature and water availability, allows plants to determine the time of the year and adjust their physiology accordingly.
7.30.599	Short-day (longnight) plants use this information to flower in the late summer and early fall, when nights exceed a critical length (often eight or fewer hours).
7.30.600	Long-day (short-night) plants flower during the spring, when darkness is less than a critical length (often eight to 15 hours).
7.30.601	Not all plants use the phytochrome system in this way.
7.30.602	Flowering in day-neutral plants is not regulated by daylength.
7.30.603	The Blue Light Responses Phototropism—the directional bending of a plant toward or away from a light source—is a response to blue wavelengths of light.
7.30.604	Positive phototropism is growth towards a light source (Figure 30.39), while negative phototropism (also called skototropism) is growth away from light.
7.30.605	The aptly-named phototropins are protein-based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response.
7.30.606	Like all plant photoreceptors, phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light-absorbing portion, called the chromophore.
7.30.607	In phototropins, the chromophore is a covalently-bound molecule of flavin; hence, phototropins belong to a class of proteins called flavoproteins.
7.30.608	Other responses under the control of phototropins are leaf opening and closing, chloroplast movement, and the opening of stomata.
7.30.609	However, of all responses controlled by phototropins, phototropism has been studied the longest and is the best understood.
7.30.610	In their 1880 treatise The Power of Movements in Plants, Charles Darwin and his son Francis first described phototropism as the bending of seedlings toward light.
7.30.611	Darwin observed that light was perceived by the tip of the plant (the apical meristem), but that the response (bending) took place in a different part of the plant.
7.30.612	They concluded that the signal had to travel from the apical meristem to the base of the plant.
7.30.613	Azure bluets (Houstonia caerulea) display a phototropic response by bending toward the light.
7.30.614	In 1913, Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that a chemical signal produced in the plant tip was responsible for the bending at the base.
7.30.615	He cut off the tip of a seedling, covered the cut section with a layer of gelatin, and then replaced the tip.
7.30.616	The seedling bent toward the light when illuminated.
7.30.617	However, when impermeable mica flakes were inserted between the tip and the cut base, the seedling did not bend.
7.30.618	A refinement of the experiment showed that the signal traveled on the shaded side of the seedling.
7.30.619	When the mica plate was inserted on the illuminated side, the plant did bend towards the light.
7.30.620	Therefore, the chemical signal was a growth stimulant because the phototropic response involved faster cell elongation on the shaded side than on the illuminated side.
7.30.621	We now know that as light passes through a plant stem, it is diffracted and generates phototropin activation across the stem.
7.30.622	Most activation occurs on the lit side, causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid (IAA) to accumulate on the shaded side.
7.30.623	Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA.
7.30.624	Cryptochromes are another class of blue-light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin-based chromophore.
7.30.625	Cryptochromes set the plants 24-hour activity cycle, also know as its circadian rhythem, using blue light cues.
7.30.626	There is some evidence that cryptochromes work together with phototropins to mediate the phototropic response.
7.30.627	Plant Responses to Gravity
7.30.628	Whether or not they germinate in the light or in total darkness, shoots usually sprout up from the ground, and roots grow downward into the ground.
7.30.629	A plant laid on its side in the dark will send shoots upward when given enough time.
7.30.630	Gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight.
7.30.631	Growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism, whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism.
7.30.632	Amyloplasts (also known as statoliths) are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in response to gravity.
7.30.633	Amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap.
7.30.634	When a plant is tilted, the statoliths drop to the new bottom cell wall.
7.30.635	A few hours later, the shoot or root will show growth in the new vertical direction.
7.30.636	The mechanism that mediates gravitropism is reasonably well understood.
7.30.637	When amyloplasts settle to the bottom of the gravity-sensing cells in the root or shoot, they physically contact the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing the release of calcium ions from inside the ER.
7.30.638	This calcium signaling in the cells causes polar transport of the plant hormone IAA to the bottom of the cell.
7.30.639	In roots, a high concentration of IAA inhibits cell elongation.
7.30.640	The effect slows growth on the lower side of the root, while cells develop normally on the upper side.
7.30.641	IAA has the opposite effect in shoots, where a higher concentration at the lower side of the shoot stimulates cell expansion, causing the shoot to grow up.
7.30.642	After the shoot or root begin to grow vertically, the amyloplasts return to their normal position.
7.30.643	Other hypotheses—involving the entire cell in the gravitropism effect—have been proposed to explain why some mutants that lack amyloplasts may still exhibit a weak gravitropic response.
7.30.644	Growth Responses
7.30.645	A plant’s sensory response to external stimuli relies on chemical messengers (hormones).
7.30.646	Plant hormones affect all aspects of plant life, from flowering to fruit setting and maturation, and from phototropism to leaf fall.
7.30.647	Potentially every cell in a plant can produce plant hormones.
7.30.648	They can act in their cell of origin or be transported to other portions of the plant body, with many plant responses involving the synergistic or antagonistic interaction of two or more hormones.
7.30.649	In contrast, animal hormones are produced in specific glands and transported to a distant site for action, and they act alone.
7.30.650	Plant hormones are a group of unrelated chemical substances that affect plant morphogenesis.
7.30.651	Five major plant hormones are traditionally described: auxins (particularly IAA), cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid.
7.30.652	In addition, other nutrients and environmental conditions can be characterized as growth factors.
7.30.653	Auxins
7.30.654	The term auxin is derived from the Greek word auxein, which means "to grow.
7.30.655	"
7.30.656	Auxins are the main hormones responsible for cell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism.
7.30.657	They also control the differentiation of meristem into vascular tissue, and promote leaf development and arrangement.
7.30.658	While many synthetic auxins are used as herbicides, IAA is the only naturally occurring auxin that shows physiological activity.
7.30.659	Apical dominance—the inhibition of lateral bud formation—is triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem.
7.30.660	Flowering, fruit setting and ripening, and inhibition of abscission (leaf falling) are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins.
7.30.661	Auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and red/far-red responses.
7.30.662	Commercial use of auxins is widespread in plant nurseries and for crop production.
7.30.663	IAA is used as a rooting hormone to promote growth of adventitious roots on cuttings and detached leaves.
7.30.664	Applying synthetic auxins to tomato plants in greenhouses promotes normal fruit development.
7.30.665	Outdoor application of auxin promotes synchronization of fruit setting and dropping to coordinate the harvesting season.
7.30.666	Fruits such as seedless cucumbers can be induced to set fruit by treating unfertilized plant flowers with auxins.
7.30.667	Cytokinins
7.30.668	The effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts to developing plant embryos in culture stimulated their growth.
7.30.669	The stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin, a hormone that promotes cytokinesis (cell division).
7.30.670	Almost 200 naturally occurring or synthetic cytokinins are known to date.
7.30.671	Cytokinins are most abundant in growing tissues, such as roots, embryos, and fruits, where cell division is occurring.
7.30.672	Cytokinins are known to delay senescence in leaf tissues, promote mitosis, and stimulate differentiation of the meristem in shoots and roots.
7.30.673	Many effects on plant development are under the influence of cytokinins, either in conjunction with auxin or another hormone.
7.30.674	For example, apical dominance seems to result from a balance between auxins that inhibit lateral buds, and cytokinins that promote bushier growth.
7.30.675	Gibberellins Gibberellins (GAs) are a group of about 125 closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation, seed germination, and fruit and flower maturation.
7.30.676	GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems, young leaves, and seed embryos.
7.30.677	In urban areas, GA antagonists are sometimes applied to trees under power lines to control growth and reduce the frequency of pruning.
7.30.678	GAs break dormancy (a state of inhibited growth and development) in the seeds of plants that require exposure to cold or light to germinate.
7.30.679	Abscisic acid is a strong antagonist of GA action.
7.30.680	Other effects of GAs include gender expression, seedless fruit development, and the delay of senescence in leaves and fruit.
7.30.681	Seedless grapes are obtained through standard breeding methods and contain inconspicuous seeds that fail to develop.
7.30.682	Because GAs are produced by the seeds, and because fruit development and stem elongation are under GA control, these varieties of grapes would normally produce small fruit in compact clusters.
7.30.683	Maturing grapes are routinely treated with GA to promote larger fruit size, as well as looser bunches (longer stems), which reduces the instance of mildew infection.
7.30.684	In grapes, application of gibberellic acid increases the size of fruit and loosens clustering.
7.30.685	Abscisic Acid
7.30.686	The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls.
7.30.687	However, more recent studies indicate that ABA plays only a minor role in the abscission process.
7.30.688	ABA accumulates as a response to stressful environmental conditions, such as dehydration, cold temperatures, or shortened day lengths.
7.30.689	Its activity counters many of the growth-promoting effects of GAs and auxins.
7.30.690	ABA inhibits stem elongation and induces dormancy in lateral buds.
7.30.691	ABA induces dormancy in seeds by blocking germination and promoting the synthesis of storage proteins.
7.30.692	Plants adapted to temperate climates require a long period of cold temperature before seeds germinate.
7.30.693	This mechanism protects young plants from sprouting too early during unseasonably warm weather in winter.
7.30.694	As the hormone gradually breaks down over winter, the seed is released from dormancy and germinates when conditions are favorable in spring.
7.30.695	Another effect of ABA is to promote the development of winter buds; it mediates the conversion of the apical meristem into a dormant bud.
7.30.696	Low soil moisture causes an increase in ABA, which causes stomata to close, reducing water loss in winter buds.
7.30.697	Ethylene Ethylene is associated with fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf fall.
7.30.698	Ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile gas (C2H4).
7.30.699	Hundreds of years ago, when gas street lamps were installed in city streets, trees that grew close to lamp posts developed twisted, thickened trunks and shed their leaves earlier than expected.
7.30.700	These effects were caused by ethylene volatilizing from the lamps.
7.30.701	Aging tissues (especially senescing leaves) and nodes of stems produce ethylene.
7.30.702	The best-known effect of the hormone, however, is the promotion of fruit ripening.
7.30.703	Ethylene stimulates the conversion of starch and acids to sugars.
7.30.704	Some people store unripe fruit, such as avocadoes, in a sealed paper bag to accelerate ripening; the gas released by the first fruit to mature will speed up the maturation of the remaining fruit.
7.30.705	Ethylene also triggers leaf and fruit abscission, flower fading and dropping, and promotes germination in some cereals and sprouting of bulbs and potatoes.
7.30.706	Ethylene is widely used in agriculture.
7.30.707	Commercial fruit growers control the timing of fruit ripening with application of the gas.
7.30.708	Horticulturalists inhibit leaf dropping in ornamental plants by removing ethylene from greenhouses using fans and ventilation.
7.30.709	Nontraditional Hormones Recent research has discovered a number of compounds that also influence plant development.
7.30.710	Their roles are less understood than the effects of the major hormones described so far.
7.30.711	Jasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory.
7.30.712	Their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a predator, resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites.
7.30.713	They contribute to the production of volatile compounds that attract natural enemies of predators.
7.30.714	For example, chewing of tomato plants by caterpillars leads to an increase in jasmonic acid levels, which in turn triggers the release of volatile compounds that attract predators of the pest.
7.30.715	Oligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections.
7.30.716	They act locally at the site of injury, and can also be transported to other tissues.
7.30.717	Strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit lateral apical development in the absence of auxins.
7.30.718	Strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae, a mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi.
7.30.719	Brassinosteroids are important to many developmental and physiological processes.
7.30.720	Signals between these compounds and other hormones, notably auxin and GAs, amplifies their physiological effect.
7.30.721	Apical dominance, seed germination, gravitropism, and resistance to freezing are all positively influenced by hormones.
7.30.722	Root growth and fruit dropping are inhibited by steroids.
7.30.723	Plant Responses to Wind and Touch
7.30.724	The shoot of a pea plant winds around a trellis, while a tree grows on an angle in response to strong prevailing winds.
7.30.725	These are examples of how plants respond to touch or wind.
7.30.726	The movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism, from the Greek words thigma meaning “touch,” and tropism implying “direction.
7.30.727	”
7.30.728	Tendrils are one example of this.
7.30.729	The meristematic region of tendrils is very touch sensitive; light touch will evoke a quick coiling response.
7.30.730	Cells in contact with a support surface contract, whereas cells on the opposite side of the support expand
7.30.731	(Figure 30.14).
7.30.732	Application of jasmonic acid is sufficient to trigger tendril coiling without a mechanical stimulus.
7.30.733	A thigmonastic response is a touch response independent of the direction of stimulus Figure 30.24.
7.30.734	In the Venus flytrap, two modified leaves are joined at a hinge and lined with thin fork-like tines along the outer edges.
7.30.735	Tiny hairs are located inside the trap.
7.30.736	When an insect brushes against these trigger hairs, touching two or more of them in succession, the leaves close quickly, trapping the prey.
7.30.737	Glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that slowly digest the insect.
7.30.738	The released nutrients are absorbed by the leaves, which reopen for the next meal.
7.30.739	Thigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous mechanical stress.
7.30.740	When trees bend in the wind, for example, growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens.
7.30.741	Strengthening tissue, especially xylem, is produced to add stiffness to resist the wind’s force.
7.30.742	Researchers hypothesize that mechanical strain induces growth and differentiation to strengthen the tissues.
7.30.743	Ethylene and jasmonate are likely involved in thigmomorphogenesis.
7.30.744	Defense Responses against Herbivores and Pathogens Plants face two types of enemies: herbivores and pathogens.
7.30.745	Herbivores both large and small use plants as food, and actively chew them.
7.30.746	Pathogens are agents of disease.
7.30.747	These infectious microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes, live off of the plant and damage its tissues.
7.30.748	Plants have developed a variety of strategies to discourage or kill attackers.
7.30.749	The first line of defense in plants is an intact and impenetrable barrier.
7.30.750	Bark and the waxy cuticle can protect against predators.
7.30.751	Other adaptations against herbivory include thorns, which are modified branches, and spines, which are modified leaves.
7.30.752	They discourage animals by causing physical damage and inducing rashes and allergic reactions.
7.30.753	A plant’s exterior protection can be compromised by mechanical damage, which may provide an entry point for pathogens.
7.30.754	If the first line of defense is breached, the plant must resort to a different set of defense mechanisms, such as toxins and enzymes.
7.30.755	Secondary metabolites are compounds that are not directly derived from photosynthesis and are not necessary for respiration or plant growth and development.
7.30.756	Many metabolites are toxic, and can even be lethal to animals that ingest them.
7.30.757	Some metabolites are alkaloids, which discourage predators with noxious odors (such as the volatile oils of mint and sage) or repellent tastes (like the bitterness of quinine).
7.30.758	Other alkaloids affect herbivores by causing either excessive stimulation (caffeine is one example) or the lethargy associated with opioids.
7.30.759	Some compounds become toxic after ingestion; for instance, glycol cyanide in the cassava root releases cyanide only upon ingestion by the herbivore.
7.30.760	Mechanical wounding and predator attacks activate defense and protection mechanisms both in the damaged tissue and at sites farther from the injury location.
7.30.761	Some defense reactions occur within minutes: others over several hours.
7.30.762	The infected and surrounding cells may die, thereby stopping the spread of infection.
7.30.763	Long-distance signaling elicits a systemic response aimed at deterring the predator.
7.30.764	As tissue is damaged, jasmonates may promote the synthesis of compounds that are toxic to predators.
7.30.765	Jasmonates also elicit the synthesis of volatile compounds that attract parasitoids, which are insects that spend their developing stages in or on another insect, and eventually kill their host.
7.30.766	The plant may activate abscission of injured tissue if it is damaged beyond repair.
7.31.0	For this (a) squash seedling (Cucurbita maxima) to develop into a mature plant bearing its (b) fruit, numerous nutritional requirements must be met.
7.31.1	Cucurbitaceae is a family of plants first cultivated in Mesoamerica, although several species are native to North America.
7.31.2	The family includes many edible species, such as squash and pumpkin, as well as inedible gourds.
7.31.3	In order to grow and develop into mature, fruit-bearing plants, many requirements must be met and events must be coordinated.
7.31.4	Seeds must germinate under the right conditions in the soil; therefore, temperature, moisture, and soil quality are important factors that play a role in germination and seedling development.
7.31.5	Soil quality and climate are significant to plant distribution and growth.
7.31.6	The young seedling will eventually grow into a mature plant, and the roots will absorb nutrients and water from the soil.
7.31.7	At the same time, the aboveground parts of the plant will absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use energy from sunlight to produce organic compounds through photosynthesis.
7.31.8	This chapter will explore the complex dynamics between plants and soils, and the adaptations that plants have evolved to make better use of nutritional resources.
7.31.9	Nutritional Requirements of Plants
7.31.10	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe how plants obtain nutrients List the elements and compounds required for proper plant nutrition Describe an essential nutrient Plants are unique organisms that can absorb nutrients and water through their root system, as well as carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
7.31.11	Soil quality and climate are the major determinants of plant distribution and growth.
7.31.12	The combination of soil nutrients, water, and carbon dioxide, along with sunlight, allows plants to grow.
7.31.13	The Chemical Composition of Plants Since plants require nutrients in the form of elements such as carbon and potassium
7.31.14	, it is important to understand the chemical composition of plants.
7.31.15	The majority of volume in a plant cell is water; it typically comprises 80 to 90 percent of the plant’s total weight.
7.31.16	Soil is the water source for land plants, and can be an abundant source of water, even if it appears dry.
7.31.17	Plant roots absorb water from the soil through root hairs and transport it up to the leaves through the xylem.
7.31.18	As water vapor is lost from the leaves, the process of transpiration and the polarity of water molecules (which enables them to form hydrogen bonds) draws more water from the roots up through the plant to the leaves (Figure 31.2).
7.31.19	Plants need water to support cell structure, for metabolic functions, to carry nutrients, and for photosynthesis.
7.31.20	Water is absorbed through the root hairs and moves up the xylem to the leaves.
7.31.21	Plant cells need essential substances, collectively called nutrients, to sustain life.
7.31.22	Plant nutrients may be composed of either organic or inorganic compounds.
7.31.23	An organic compound is a chemical compound that contains carbon, such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere.
7.31.24	Carbon that was obtained from atmospheric CO2 composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants.
7.31.25	An inorganic compound does not contain carbon and is not part of, or produced by, a living organism.
7.31.26	Inorganic substances, which form the majority of the soil solution, are commonly called minerals: those required by plants include nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) for structure and regulation.
7.31.27	Essential Nutrients Plants require only light, water and about 20 elements to support all their biochemical needs: these 20 elements are called essential nutrients (Table 31.1).
7.31.28	For an element to be regarded as essential, three criteria are required: 1) a plant cannot complete its life cycle without the element; 2) no other element can perform the function of the element; and 3) the element is directly involved in plant nutrition.
7.31.29	Macronutrients and Micronutrients
7.31.30	The essential elements can be divided into two groups: macronutrients and micronutrients.
7.31.31	Nutrients that plants require in larger amounts are called macronutrients.
7.31.32	About half of the essential elements are considered macronutrients: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur.
7.31.33	The first of these macronutrients, carbon (C), is required to form carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and many other compounds; it is therefore present in all macromolecules.
7.31.34	On average, the dry weight (excluding water) of a cell is 50 percent carbon.
7.31.35	As shown in Figure 31.3, carbon is a key part of plant biomolecules.
7.31.36	Cellulose, the main structural component of the plant cell wall, makes up over thirty percent of plant matter.
7.31.37	It is the most abundant organic compound on earth.
7.31.38	Plants are able to make their own cellulose, but need carbon from the soil to do so.
7.31.39	The next most abundant element in plant cells is nitrogen (N); it is part of proteins and nucleic acids.
7.31.40	Nitrogen is also used in the synthesis of some vitamins.
7.31.41	Hydrogen and oxygen are macronutrients that are part of many organic compounds, and also form water.
7.31.42	Oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration; plants use oxygen to store energy in the form of ATP.
7.31.43	Phosphorus (P), another macromolecule, is necessary to synthesize nucleic acids and phospholipids.
7.31.44	As part of ATP, phosphorus enables food energy to be converted into chemical energy through oxidative phosphorylation.
7.31.45	Likewise, light energy is converted into chemical energy during photophosphorylation in photosynthesis, and into chemical energy to be extracted during respiration.
7.31.46	Sulfur is part of certain amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine, and is present in several coenzymes.
7.31.47	Sulfur also plays a role in photosynthesis as part of the electron transport chain, where hydrogen gradients play a key role in the conversion of light energy into ATP.
7.31.48	Potassium (K) is important because of its role in regulating stomatal opening and closing.
7.31.49	As the openings for gas exchange, stomata help maintain a healthy water balance; a potassium ion pump supports this process.
7.31.50	Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) are also important macronutrients.
7.31.51	The role of calcium is twofold: to regulate nutrient transport, and to support many enzyme functions.
7.31.52	Magnesium is important to the photosynthetic process.
7.31.53	These minerals, along with the micronutrients, which are described below, also contribute to the plant’s ionic balance.
7.31.54	In addition to macronutrients, organisms require various elements in small amounts.
7.31.55	These micronutrients, or trace elements, are present in very small quantities.
7.31.56	They include boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), silicon (Si), and sodium (Na).
7.31.57	Deficiencies in any of these nutrients—particularly the macronutrients—can adversely affect plant growth (Figure 31.4.
7.31.58	Depending on the specific nutrient, a lack can cause stunted growth, slow growth, or chlorosis (yellowing of the leaves).
7.31.59	Extreme deficiencies may result in leaves showing signs of cell death.
7.31.60	Nutrient deficiency is evident in the symptoms these plants show.
7.31.61	This (a) grape tomato suffers from blossom end rot caused by calcium deficiency.
7.31.62	The yellowing in this (b) Frangula alnus results from magnesium deficiency.
7.31.63	Inadequate magnesium also leads to (c) intervenal chlorosis, seen here in a sweetgum leaf.
7.31.64	This (d) palm is affected by potassium deficiency.
7.31.65	The Soil
7.31.66	By the end of this section, you will be able to:
7.31.67	Describe how soils are formed Explain soil composition Describe a soil profile Plants obtain inorganic elements from the soil, which serves as a natural medium for land plants.
7.31.68	Soil is the outer loose layer that covers the surface of Earth.
7.31.69	Soil quality is a major determinant, along with climate, of plant distribution and growth.
7.31.70	Soil quality depends not only on the chemical composition of the soil, but also the topography (regional surface features) and the presence of living organisms.
7.31.71	In agriculture, the history of the soil, such as the cultivating practices and previous crops, modify the characteristics and fertility of that soil.
7.31.72	Soil develops very slowly over long periods of time, and its formation results from natural and environmental forces acting on mineral, rock, and organic compounds.
7.31.73	Soils can be divided into two groups: organic soils are those that are formed from sedimentation and primarily composed of organic matter, while those that are formed from the weathering of rocks and are primarily composed of inorganic material are called mineral soils.
7.31.74	Mineral soils are predominant in terrestrial ecosystems, where soils may be covered by water for part of the year or exposed to the atmosphere.
7.31.75	Soil Composition Soil consists of these major components (Figure 31.5): • inorganic mineral matter, about 40 to 45 percent of the soil volume • organic matter, about 5 percent of the soil volume • water and air, about 50 percent of the soil volume
7.31.76	The amount of each of the four major components of soil depends on the amount of vegetation, soil compaction, and water present in the soil.
7.31.77	A good healthy soil has sufficient air, water, minerals, and organic material to promote and sustain plant life.
7.31.78	The organic material of soil, called humus, is made up of microorganisms (dead and alive), and dead animals and plants in varying stages of decay.
7.31.79	Humus improves soil structure and provides plants with water and minerals.
7.31.80	The inorganic material of soil consists of rock, slowly broken down into smaller particles that vary in size.
7.31.81	Soil particles that are 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter are sand.
7.31.82	Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt, and even smaller particles, less than 0.002 mm in diameter, are called clay.
7.31.83	Some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand, silt, and humus; these soils are called loams.
7.31.84	Soil Formation Soil formation is the consequence of a combination of biological, physical, and chemical processes.
7.31.85	Soil should ideally contain 50 percent solid material and 50 percent pore space.
7.31.86	About one-half of the pore space should contain water, and the other half should contain air.
7.31.87	The organic component of soil serves as a cementing agent, returns nutrients to the plant, allows soil to store moisture, makes soil tillable for farming, and provides energy for soil microorganisms.
7.31.88	Most soil microorganisms—bacteria, algae, or fungi—are dormant in dry soil, but become active once moisture is available.
7.31.89	Soil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers; together, the vertical section of a soil is called the soil profile.
7.31.90	Within the soil profile, soil scientists define zones called horizons.
7.31.91	A horizon is a soil layer with distinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers.
7.31.92	Five factors account for soil formation: parent material, climate, topography, biological factors, and time.
7.31.93	Parent Material
7.31.94	The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material.
7.31.95	Mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock, the solid rock that lies beneath the soil, and therefore, they have a similar composition to the original rock.
7.31.96	Other soils form in materials that came from elsewhere, such as sand and glacial drift.
7.31.97	Materials located in the depth of the soil are relatively unchanged compared with the deposited material.
7.31.98	Sediments in rivers may have different characteristics, depending on whether the stream moves quickly or slowly.
7.31.99	A fast-moving river could have sediments of rocks and sand, whereas a slow-moving river could have fine-textured material, such as clay.
7.31.100	Climate Temperature, moisture, and wind cause different patterns of weathering and therefore affect soil characteristics.
7.31.101	The presence of moisture and nutrients from weathering will also promote biological activity: a key component of a quality soil.
7.31.102	Topography Regional surface features (familiarly called “the lay of the land”) can have a major influence on the characteristics and fertility of a soil.
7.31.103	Topography affects water runoff, which strips away parent material and affects plant growth.
7.31.104	Steeps soils are more prone to erosion and may be thinner than soils that are relatively flat or level.
7.31.105	Biological factors
7.31.106	The presence of living organisms greatly affects soil formation and structure.
7.31.107	Animals and microorganisms can produce pores and crevices, and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation.
7.31.108	Plant secretions promote the development of microorganisms around the root, in an area known as the rhizosphere.
7.31.109	Additionally, leaves and other material that fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition.
7.31.110	Time Time is an important factor in soil formation because soils develop over long periods.
7.31.111	Soil formation is a dynamic process.
7.31.112	Materials are deposited over time, decompose, and transform into other materials that can be used by living organisms or deposited onto the surface of the soil.
7.31.113	Physical Properties of the Soil Soils are named and classified based on their horizons.
7.31.114	The soil profile has four distinct layers: 1)
7.31.115	O horizon; 2)
7.31.116	A horizon; 3) B horizon, or subsoil; and 4) C horizon, or soil base (Figure 31.6).
7.31.117	The O horizon has freshly decomposing organic matter—humus—at its surface, with decomposed vegetation at its base.
7.31.118	Humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances soil moisture retention.
7.31.119	Topsoil—
7.31.120	the top layer of soil—is usually two to three inches deep, but this depth can vary considerably.
7.31.121	For instance, river deltas like the Mississippi River delta have deep layers of topsoil.
7.31.122	Topsoil is rich in organic material; microbial processes occur there, and it is the “workhorse” of plant production.
7.31.123	The A horizon consists of a mixture of organic material with inorganic products of weathering, and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil.
7.31.124	This horizon is typically darkly colored because of the presence of organic matter.
7.31.125	In this area, rainwater percolates through the soil and carries materials from the surface.
7.31.126	The B horizon is an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward, resulting in a dense layer in the soil.
7.31.127	In some soils, the B horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate.
7.31.128	The C horizon, or soil base, includes the parent material, plus the organic and inorganic material that is broken down to form soil.
7.31.129	The parent material may be either created in its natural place, or transported from elsewhere to its present location.
7.31.130	Beneath the C horizon lies bedrock.
7.31.131	Some soils may have additional layers, or lack one of these layers.
7.31.132	The thickness of the layers is also variable, and depends on the factors that influence soil formation.
7.31.133	In general, immature soils may have O, A, and C horizons, whereas mature soils may display all of these, plus additional layers.
7.31.134	The San Joaquin soil profile has an O horizon, A horizon, B horizon, and C horizon.
7.31.135	Nutritional Adaptations of Plants
7.31.136	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Understand the nutritional adaptations of plants Describe mycorrhizae
7.31.137	Explain nitrogen fixation Plants obtain food in two different ways.
7.31.138	Autotrophic plants can make their own food from inorganic raw materials, such as carbon dioxide and water, through photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight.
7.31.139	Green plants are included in this group.
7.31.140	Some plants, however, are heterotrophic: they are totally parasitic and lacking in chlorophyll.
7.31.141	These plants, referred to as holo-parasitic plants, are unable to synthesize organic carbon and draw all of their nutrients from the host plant.
7.31.142	Plants may also enlist the help of microbial partners in nutrient acquisition.
7.31.143	Particular species of bacteria and fungi have evolved along with certain plants to create a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with roots.
7.31.144	This improves the nutrition of both the plant and the microbe.
7.31.145	The formation of nodules in legume plants and mycorrhization can be considered among the nutritional adaptations of plants.
7.31.146	However, these are not the only type of adaptations that we may find; many plants have other adaptations that allow them to thrive under specific conditions.
7.31.147	Nitrogen Fixation: Root and Bacteria Interactions Nitrogen is an important macronutrient because it is part of nucleic acids and proteins.
7.31.148	Atmospheric nitrogen, which is the diatomic molecule N2, or dinitrogen, is the largest pool of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems.
7.31.149	However, plants cannot take advantage of this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes to convert it into biologically useful forms.
7.31.150	However, nitrogen can be “fixed,” which means that it can be converted to ammonia (NH3) through biological, physical, or chemical processes.
7.31.151	As you have learned, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3), exclusively carried out by prokaryotes such as soil bacteria or cyanobacteria.
7.31.152	Biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture.
7.31.153	The following equation represents the process: N2 + 16 ATP + 8 e− +
7.31.154	8
7.31.155	H+
7.31.156	→
7.31.157	2NH3 +
7.31.158	16 ADP +
7.31.159	16 Pi + H2
7.31.160	The most important source of BNF is the symbiotic interaction between soil bacteria and legume plants, including many crops important to humans (Figure 31.9).
7.31.161	The NH3 resulting from fixation can be transported into plant tissue and incorporated into amino acids, which are then made into plant proteins.
7.31.162	Some legume seeds, such as soybeans and peanuts, contain high levels of protein, and serve among the most important agricultural sources of protein in the world.
7.31.163	Soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules, in which nitrogen fixation takes place.
7.31.164	This process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, by means of the enzyme nitrogenase.
7.31.165	Therefore, using rhizobia is a natural and environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants, as opposed to chemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable resource, such as natural gas.
7.31.166	Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen from the atmosphere.
7.31.167	The process simultaneously contributes to soil fertility because the plant root system leaves behind some of the biologically available nitrogen.
7.31.168	As in any symbiosis, both organisms benefit from the interaction: the plant obtains ammonia, and bacteria obtain carbon compounds generated through photosynthesis, as well as a protected niche in which to grow.
7.31.169	Soybean roots contain (a) nitrogen-fixing nodules.
7.31.170	Cells within the nodules are infected with Bradyrhyzobium japonicum, a rhizobia or “root-loving” bacterium.
7.31.171	The bacteria are encased in (b) vesicles inside the cell, as can be seen in this transmission electron micrograph.
7.31.172	Mycorrhizae:
7.31.173	The Symbiotic Relationship between Fungi and Roots
7.31.174	A nutrient depletion zone can develop when there is rapid soil solution uptake, low nutrient concentration, low diffusion rate, or low soil moisture.
7.31.175	These conditions are very common; therefore, most plants rely on fungi to facilitate the uptake of minerals from the soil.
7.31.176	Fungi form symbiotic associations called mycorrhizae with plant roots, in which the fungi actually are integrated into the physical structure of the root.
7.31.177	The fungi colonize the living root tissue during active plant growth.
7.31.178	Through mycorrhization, the plant obtains mainly phosphate and other minerals, such as zinc and copper, from the soil.
7.31.179	The fungus obtains nutrients, such as sugars, from the plant root (Figure 31.11).
7.31.180	Mycorrhizae help increase the surface area of the plant root system because hyphae, which are narrow, can spread beyond the nutrient depletion zone.
7.31.181	Hyphae can grow into small soil pores that allow access to phosphorus that would otherwise be unavailable to the plant.
7.31.182	The beneficial effect on the plant is best observed in poor soils.
7.31.183	The benefit to fungi is that they can obtain up to 20 percent of the total carbon accessed by plants.
7.31.184	Mycorrhizae functions as a physical barrier to pathogens.
7.31.185	It also provides an induction of generalized host defense mechanisms, and sometimes involves production of antibiotic compounds by the fungi.
7.31.186	Root tips proliferate in the presence of mycorrhizal infection, which appears as off-white fuzz in this image.
7.31.187	There are two types of mycorrhizae: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae.
7.31.188	Ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath around the roots, called a mantle.
7.31.189	Hyphae from the fungi extend from the mantle into the soil, which increases the surface area for water and mineral absorption.
7.31.190	This type of mycorrhizae is found in forest trees, especially conifers, birches, and oaks.
7.31.191	Endomycorrhizae, also called arbuscular mycorrhizae, do not form a dense sheath over the root.
7.31.192	Instead, the fungal mycelium is embedded within the root tissue.
7.31.193	Endomycorrhizae are found in the roots of more than 80 percent of terrestrial plants.
7.31.194	Nutrients from Other Sources
7.31.195	Some plants cannot produce their own food and must obtain their nutrition from outside sources.
7.31.196	This may occur with plants that are parasitic or saprophytic.
7.31.197	Some plants are mutualistic symbionts, epiphytes, or insectivorous.
7.31.198	Plant Parasites
7.31.199	A parasitic plant depends on its host for survival.
7.31.200	Some parasitic plants have no leaves.
7.31.201	An example of this is the dodder (Figure 31.12), which has a weak, cylindrical stem that coils around the host and forms suckers.
7.31.202	From these suckers, cells invade the host stem and grow to connect with the vascular bundles of the host.
7.31.203	The parasitic plant obtains water and nutrients through these connections.
7.31.204	The plant is a total parasite (a holoparasite) because it is completely dependent on its host.
7.31.205	Other parasitic plants (hemiparasites) are fully photosynthetic and only use the host for water and minerals.
7.31.206	There are about 4,100 species of parasitic plants.
7.31.207	The dodder is a holoparasite that penetrates the host’s vascular tissue and diverts nutrients for its own growth.
7.31.208	Note that the vines of the dodder, which has white flowers, are beige.
7.31.209	The dodder has no chlorophyll and cannot produce its own food.
7.31.210	Saprophytes
7.31.211	A saprophyte is a plant that does not have chlorophyll and gets its food from dead matter, similar to bacteria and fungi (note that fungi are often called saprophytes, which is incorrect, because fungi are not plants).
7.31.212	Plants like these use enzymes to convert organic food materials into simpler forms from which they can absorb nutrients (Figure 31.13).
7.31.213	Most saprophytes do not directly digest dead matter: instead, they parasitize fungi that digest dead matter, or are mycorrhizal, ultimately obtaining photosynthate from a fungus that derived photosynthate from its host.
7.31.214	Saprophytic plants are uncommon; only a few species are described.
7.31.215	Saprophytes, like this Dutchmen’s pipe (Monotropa hypopitys), obtain their food from dead matter and do not have chlorophyll.
7.31.216	Symbionts
7.31.217	A symbiont is a plant in a symbiotic relationship, with special adaptations such as mycorrhizae or nodule formation.
7.31.218	Fungi also form symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria and green algae (called lichens).
7.31.219	Lichens can sometimes be seen as colorful growths on the surface of rocks and trees (Figure 31.14).
7.31.220	The algal partner (phycobiont) makes food autotrophically, some of which it shares with the fungus; the fungal partner (mycobiont) absorbs water and minerals from the environment, which are made available to the green alga.
7.31.221	If one partner was separated from the other, they would both die.
7.31.222	Lichens, which often have symbiotic relationships with other plants, can sometimes be found growing on trees.
7.31.223	Epiphytes
7.31.224	An epiphyte is a plant that grows on other plants, but is not dependent upon the other plant for nutrition (Figure 31.15).
7.31.225	Epiphytes have two types of roots: clinging aerial roots, which absorb nutrients from humus that accumulates in the crevices of trees; and aerial roots, which absorb moisture from the atmosphere.
7.31.226	These epiphyte plants grow in the main greenhouse of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.
7.31.227	Insectivorous Plants
7.31.228	An insectivorous plant has specialized leaves to attract and digest insects.
7.31.229	The Venus flytrap is popularly known for its insectivorous mode of nutrition, and has leaves that work as traps (Figure 31.16).
7.31.230	The minerals it obtains from prey compensate for those lacking in the boggy (low pH)
7.31.231	soil of its native North Carolina coastal plains.
7.31.232	There are three sensitive hairs in the center of each half of each leaf.
7.31.233	The edges of each leaf are covered with long spines.
7.31.234	Nectar secreted by the plant attracts flies to the leaf.
7.31.235	When a fly touches the sensory hairs, the leaf immediately closes.
7.31.236	Next, fluids and enzymes break down the prey and minerals are absorbed by the leaf.
7.31.237	Since this plant is popular in the horticultural trade, it is threatened in its original habitat.
7.31.238	A Venus flytrap has specialized leaves to trap insects.
7.32.0	Plants that reproduce sexually often achieve fertilization with the help of pollinators such as (a) bees, (b) birds, and (c) butterflies.

7.32.2	Introduction Plants have evolved different reproductive strategies for the continuation of their species.
7.32.3	Some plants reproduce sexually, and others asexually, in contrast to animal species, which rely almost exclusively on sexual reproduction.
7.32.4	Plant sexual reproduction usually depends on pollinating agents, while asexual reproduction is independent of these agents.
7.32.5	Flowers are often the showiest or most strongly scented part of plants.
7.32.6	With their bright colors, fragrances, and interesting shapes and sizes, flowers attract insects, birds, and animals to serve their pollination needs.
7.32.7	Other plants pollinate via wind or water; still others self-pollinate.
7.32.8	Sexual reproduction takes place with slight variations in different groups of plants.
7.32.9	Plants have two distinct stages in their lifecycle: the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage.
7.32.10	The haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures.
7.32.11	Fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote, which develops into the sporophyte.
7.32.12	After reaching maturity, the diploid sporophyte produces spores by meiosis, which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte.
7.32.13	The new gametophyte produces gametes, and the cycle continues.
7.32.14	This is the alternation of generations, and is typical of plant reproduction The alternation of generations in angiosperms is depicted in this diagram.
7.32.15	The life cycle of higher plants is dominated by the sporophyte stage, with the gametophyte borne on the sporophyte.
7.32.16	In ferns, the gametophyte is free-living and very distinct in structure from the diploid sporophyte.
7.32.17	In bryophytes, such as mosses, the haploid gametophyte is more developed than the sporophyte.
7.32.18	During the vegetative phase of growth, plants increase in size and produce a shoot system and a root system.
7.32.19	As they enter the reproductive phase, some of the branches start to bear flowers.
7.32.20	Many flowers are borne singly, whereas some are borne in clusters.
7.32.21	The flower is borne on a stalk known as a receptacle.
7.32.22	Flower shape, color, and size are unique to each species, and are often used by taxonomists to classify plants.
7.32.23	Sexual Reproduction in Angiosperms
7.32.24	The lifecycle of angiosperms follows the alternation of generations explained previously.
7.32.25	The haploid gametophyte alternates with the diploid sporophyte during the sexual reproduction process of angiosperms.
7.32.26	Flowers contain the plant’s reproductive structures.
7.32.27	Flower Structure
7.32.28	A typical flower has four main parts—or whorls—known as the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium (Figure 32.3).
7.32.29	The outermost whorl of the flower has green, leafy structures known as sepals.
7.32.30	The sepals, collectively called the calyx, help to protect the unopened bud.
7.32.31	The second whorl is comprised of petals—usually, brightly colored—collectively called the corolla.
7.32.32	The number of sepals and petals varies depending on whether the plant is a monocot or dicot.
7.32.33	In monocots, petals usually number three or multiples of three; in dicots, the number of petals is four or five, or multiples of four and five.
7.32.34	Together, the calyx and corolla are known as the perianth.
7.32.35	The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium.
7.32.36	The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia.
7.32.37	The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium, or the female reproductive component(s).
7.32.38	The carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma, style, and ovary.
7.32.39	A flower may have one or multiple carpels.
7.32.40	If all four whorls (the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium) are present, the flower is described as complete.
7.32.41	If any of the four parts is missing, the flower is known as incomplete.
7.32.42	Flowers that contain both an androecium and a gynoecium are called perfect, androgynous or hermaphrodites.
7.32.43	There are two types of incomplete flowers: staminate flowers contain only an androecium, and carpellate flowers have only a gynoecium
7.32.44	The corn plant has both staminate (male) and carpellate (female) flowers.
7.32.45	Staminate flowers, which are clustered in the tassel at the tip of the stem, produce pollen grains.
7.32.46	Carpellate flower are clustered in the immature ears.
7.32.47	Each strand of silk is a stigma.
7.32.48	The corn kernels are seeds that develop on the ear after fertilization.
7.32.49	Also shown is the lower stem and root.
7.32.50	If both male and female flowers are borne on the same plant, the species is called monoecious (meaning “one home”): examples are corn and pea.
7.32.51	Species with male and female flowers borne on separate plants are termed dioecious, or “two homes,” examples of which are C. papaya and Cannabis.
7.32.52	The ovary, which may contain one or multiple ovules, may be placed above other flower parts, which is referred to as superior; or, it may be placed below the other flower parts, referred to as inferior  
7.32.53	The (a) lily is a superior flower, which has the ovary above the other flower parts.
7.32.54	(b) Fuchsia is an inferior flower, which has the ovary beneath other flower parts.

7.32.56	Male Gametophyte (The Pollen Grain)
7.32.57	The male gametophyte develops and reaches maturity in an immature anther.
7.32.58	In a plant’s male reproductive organs, development of pollen takes place in a structure known as the microsporangium (Figure 32.6).
7.32.59	The microsporangia, which are usually bi-lobed, are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains.
7.32.60	These are found in the anther, which is at the end of the stamen—the long filament that supports the anther.
7.32.61	Shown is (a) a cross section of an anther at two developmental stages.
7.32.62	The immature anther (top) contains four microsporangia, or pollen sacs.
7.32.63	Each microsporangium contains hundreds of microspore mother cells that will each give rise to four pollen grains.
7.32.64	The tapetum supports the development and maturation of the pollen grains.
7.32.65	Upon maturation of the pollen (bottom), the pollen sac walls split open and the pollen grains (male gametophytes) are released.
7.32.66	(b)
7.32.67	In these scanning electron micrographs, pollen sacs are ready to burst, releasing their grains.
7.32.68	(credit b: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.32.69	Within the microsporangium, the microspore mother cell divides by meiosis to give rise to four microspores, each of which will ultimately form a pollen grain (Figure 32.7).
7.32.70	An inner layer of cells, known as the tapetum, provides nutrition to the developing microspores and contributes key components to the pollen wall.
7.32.71	Mature pollen grains contain two cells: a generative cell and a pollen tube cell.
7.32.72	The generative cell is contained within the larger pollen tube cell.
7.32.73	Upon germination, the tube cell forms the pollen tube through which the generative cell migrates to enter the ovary.
7.32.74	During its transit inside the pollen tube, the generative cell divides to form two male gametes (sperm cells).
7.32.75	Upon maturity, the microsporangia burst, releasing the pollen grains from the anther.
7.32.76	Pollen develops from the microspore mother cells.
7.32.77	The mature pollen grain is composed of two cells: the pollen tube cell and the generative cell, which is inside the tube cell.
7.32.78	The pollen grain has two coverings: an inner layer (intine) and an outer layer (exine).
7.32.79	The inset scanning electron micrograph shows Arabidopsis lyrata pollen grains.
7.32.80	(credit “pollen micrograph”: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.32.81	Each pollen grain has two coverings: the exine (thicker, outer layer) and the intine (Figure 32.7).
7.32.82	The exine contains sporopollenin, a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells.
7.32.83	Sporopollenin allows the pollen to survive under unfavorable conditions and to be carried by wind, water, or biological agents without undergoing damage.
7.32.84	Female Gametophyte (The Embryo Sac)
7.32.85	While the details may vary between species, the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases.
7.32.86	First, in the process of megasporogenesis, a single cell in the diploid megasporangium—an area of tissue in the ovules—undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores, only one of which survives.
7.32.87	During the second phase, megagametogenesis, the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate, seven-cell female gametophyte, also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac.
7.32.88	Two of the nuclei—
7.32.89	the polar nuclei—move to the equator and fuse, forming a single, diploid central cell.
7.32.90	This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm.
7.32.91	Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells, which later degenerate.
7.32.92	The nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete, or egg cell, and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells (Figure 32.8).
7.32.93	The synergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization, after which they disintegrate.
7.32.94	Once fertilization is complete, the resulting diploid zygote develops into the embryo, and the fertilized ovule forms the other tissues of the seed.
7.32.95	A double-layered integument protects the megasporangium and, later, the embryo sac.
7.32.96	The integument will develop into the seed coat after fertilization and protect the entire seed.
7.32.97	The ovule wall will become part of the fruit.
7.32.98	The integuments, while protecting the megasporangium, do not enclose it completely, but leave an opening called the micropyle.
7.32.99	The micropyle allows the pollen tube to enter the female gametophyte for fertilization.
7.32.100	Sexual Reproduction in Gymnosperms
7.32.101	As with angiosperms, the lifecycle of a gymnosperm is also characterized by alternation of generations.
7.32.102	In conifers such as pines, the green leafy part of the plant is the sporophyte, and the cones contain the male and female gametophytes (Figure 32.9).
7.32.103	The female cones are larger than the male cones and are positioned towards the top of the tree; the small, male cones are located in the lower region of the tree.
7.32.104	Because the pollen is shed and blown by the wind, this arrangement makes it difficult for a gymnosperm to self-pollinate.
7.32.105	This image shows the life cycle of a conifer.
7.32.106	Pollen from male cones blows up into upper branches, where it fertilizes female cones.
7.32.107	Examples are shown of female and male cones.

7.32.110	Male Gametophyte
7.32.111	A male cone has a central axis on which bracts, a type of modified leaf, are attached.
7.32.112	The bracts are known as microsporophylls (Figure 32.10) and are the sites where microspores will develop.
7.32.113	The microspores develop inside the microsporangium.
7.32.114	Within the microsporangium, cells known as microsporocytes divide by meiosis to produce four haploid microspores.
7.32.115	Further mitosis of the microspore produces two nuclei: the generative nucleus, and the tube nucleus.
7.32.116	Upon maturity, the male gametophyte (pollen) is released from the male cones and is carried by the wind to land on the female cone.
7.32.117	Female Gametophyte
7.32.118	The female cone also has a central axis on which bracts known as megasporophylls (Figure 32.10) are present.
7.32.119	In the female cone, megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium.
7.32.120	The megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to produce four haploid megaspores.
7.32.121	One of the megaspores divides to form the multicellular female gametophyte, while the others divide to form the rest of the structure.
7.32.122	The female gametophyte is contained within a structure called the archegonium.
7.32.123	These series of micrographs shows male and female gymnosperm gametophytes.
7.32.124	(a)
7.32.125	This male cone, shown in cross section, has approximately 20 microsporophylls, each of which produces hundreds of male gametophytes (pollen grains).
7.32.126	(b) Pollen grains are visible in this single microsporophyll.
7.32.127	(c)
7.32.128	This micrograph shows an individual pollen grain.

7.32.130	This cross section of a female cone shows portions of about 15 megasporophylls.

7.32.134	Within this single ovule are the megaspore mother cell (MMC), micropyle, and a pollen grain.
7.32.135	(credit: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell) Reproductive Process
7.32.136	Upon landing on the female cone, the tube cell of the pollen forms the pollen tube, through which the generative cell migrates towards the female gametophyte through the micropyle.
7.32.137	It takes approximately one year for the pollen tube to grow and migrate towards the female gametophyte.
7.32.138	The male gametophyte containing the generative cell splits into two sperm nuclei, one of which fuses with the egg, while the other degenerates.
7.32.139	After fertilization of the egg, the diploid zygote is formed, which divides by mitosis to form the embryo.
7.32.140	The scales of the cones are closed during development of the seed.
7.32.141	The seed is covered by a seed coat, which is derived from the female sporophyte.
7.32.142	Seed development takes another one to two years.
7.32.143	Once the seed is ready to be dispersed, the bracts of the female cones open to allow the dispersal of seed; no fruit formation takes place because gymnosperm seeds have no covering.
7.32.144	Angiosperms versus Gymnosperms Gymnosperm reproduction differs from that of angiosperms in several ways (Figure 32.11).
7.32.145	In angiosperms, the female gametophyte exists in an enclosed structure—
7.32.146	the ovule—which is within the ovary; in gymnosperms, the female gametophyte is present on exposed bracts of the female cone.
7.32.147	Double fertilization is a key event in the lifecycle of angiosperms, but is completely absent in gymnosperms.
7.32.148	The male and female gametophyte structures are present on separate male and female cones in gymnosperms, whereas in angiosperms, they are a part of the flower.
7.32.149	Lastly, wind plays an important role in pollination in gymnosperms because pollen is blown by the wind to land on the female cones.
7.32.150	Although many angiosperms are also wind-pollinated, animal pollination is more common.
7.32.151	(a) Angiosperms are flowering plants, and include grasses, herbs, shrubs and most deciduous trees, while (b) gymnosperms are conifers.
7.32.152	Both produce seeds but have different reproductive strategies.
7.32.153	(credit a: modification of work by Wendy Cutler; credit b: modification of work by Lews Castle UHI)
7.32.154	In angiosperms, pollination is defined as the placement or transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower.
7.32.155	In gymnosperms, pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the female cone.
7.32.156	Upon transfer, the pollen germinates to form the pollen tube and the sperm for fertilizing the egg.
7.32.157	Pollination has been well studied since the time of Gregor Mendel.
7.32.158	Mendel successfully carried out self- as well as cross-pollination in garden peas while studying how characteristics were passed on from one generation to the next.
7.32.159	Today’s crops are a result of plant breeding, which employs artificial selection to produce the present-day cultivars.
7.32.160	A case in point is today's corn, which is a result of years of breeding that started with its ancestor, teosinte.
7.32.161	The teosinte that the ancient Mayans originally began cultivating had tiny seeds—vastly different from today’s relatively giant ears of corn.
7.32.162	Interestingly, though these two plants appear to be entirely different, the genetic difference between them is miniscule.
7.32.163	Pollination takes two forms: self-pollination and cross-pollination.
7.32.164	Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant.
7.32.165	Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.
7.32.166	Self- pollination occurs in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower’s stigma.
7.32.167	This method of pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.
7.32.168	Living species are designed to ensure survival of their progeny; those that fail become extinct.
7.32.169	Genetic diversity is therefore required so that in changing environmental or stress conditions, some of the progeny can survive.
7.32.170	Self-pollination leads to the production of plants with less genetic diversity, since genetic material from the same plant is used to form gametes, and eventually, the zygote.
7.32.171	In contrast, cross-pollination—or out-crossing—leads to greater genetic diversity because the microgametophyte and megagametophyte are derived from different plants.
7.32.172	Because cross-pollination allows for more genetic diversity, plants have developed many ways to avoid self-pollination.
7.32.173	In some species, the pollen and the ovary mature at different times.
7.32.174	These flowers make self-pollination nearly impossible.
7.32.175	By the time pollen matures and has been shed, the stigma of this flower is mature and can only be pollinated by pollen from another flower.
7.32.176	Some flowers have developed physical features that prevent self-pollination.
7.32.177	The primrose is one such flower.
7.32.178	Primroses have evolved two flower types with differences in anther and stigma length: the pin-eyed flower has anthers positioned at the pollen tube’s halfway point, and the thrum-eyed flower’s stigma is likewise located at the halfway point.
7.32.179	Insects easily cross-pollinate while seeking the nectar at the bottom of the pollen tube.
7.32.180	This phenomenon is also known as heterostyly.
7.32.181	Many plants, such as cucumber, have male and female flowers located on different parts of the plant, thus making self-pollination difficult.
7.32.182	In yet other species, the male and female flowers are borne on different plants (dioecious).
7.32.183	All of these are barriers to self-pollination; therefore, the plants depend on pollinators to transfer pollen.
7.32.184	The majority of pollinators are biotic agents such as insects (like bees, flies, and butterflies), bats, birds, and other animals.
7.32.185	Other plant species are pollinated by abiotic agents, such as wind and water.
7.32.186	Pollination by Insects Bees are perhaps the most important pollinator of many garden plants and most commercial fruit trees (Figure 32.12).
7.32.187	The most common species of bees are bumblebees and honeybees.
7.32.188	Since bees cannot see the color red, bee-pollinated flowers usually have shades of blue, yellow, or other colors.
7.32.189	Bees collect energy-rich pollen or nectar for their survival and energy needs.
7.32.190	They visit flowers that are open during the day, are brightly colored, have a strong aroma or scent, and have a tubular shape, typically with the presence of a nectar guide.
7.32.191	A nectar guide includes regions on the flower petals that are visible only to bees, and not to humans; it helps to guide bees to the center of the flower, thus making the pollination process more efficient.
7.32.192	The pollen sticks to the bees’ fuzzy hair, and when the bee visits another flower, some of the pollen is transferred to the second flower.
7.32.193	Recently, there have been many reports about the declining population of honeybees.
7.32.194	Many flowers will remain unpollinated and not bear seed if honeybees disappear.
7.32.195	The impact on commercial fruit growers could be devastating.
7.32.196	Insects, such as bees, are important agents of pollination.
7.32.197	Many flies are attracted to flowers that have a decaying smell or an odor of rotting flesh.
7.32.198	These flowers, which produce nectar, usually have dull colors, such as brown or purple.
7.32.199	They are found on the corpse flower or voodoo lily (Amorphophallus), dragon arum (Dracunculus), and carrion flower (Stapleia, Rafflesia).
7.32.200	The nectar provides energy, whereas the pollen provides protein.
7.32.201	Wasps are also important insect pollinators, and pollinate many species of figs.
7.32.202	Butterflies, such as the monarch, pollinate many garden flowers and wildflowers, which usually occur in clusters.
7.32.203	These flowers are brightly colored, have a strong fragrance, are open during the day, and have nectar guides to make access to nectar easier.
7.32.204	The pollen is picked up and carried on the butterfly’s limbs.
7.32.205	Moths, on the other hand, pollinate flowers during the late afternoon and night.
7.32.206	The flowers pollinated by moths are pale or white and are flat, enabling the moths to land.
7.32.207	One well-studied example of a moth-pollinated plant is the yucca plant, which is pollinated by the yucca moth.
7.32.208	The shape of the flower and moth have adapted in such a way as to allow successful pollination.
7.32.209	The moth deposits pollen on the sticky stigma for fertilization to occur later.
7.32.210	The female moth also deposits eggs into the ovary.
7.32.211	As the eggs develop into larvae, they obtain food from the flower and developing seeds.
7.32.212	Thus, both the insect and flower benefit from each other in this symbiotic relationship.
7.32.213	The corn earworm moth and Gaura plant have a similar relationship.
7.32.214	A corn earworm sips nectar from a night-blooming Gaura plant.
7.32.215	Pollination by Bats
7.32.216	In the tropics and deserts, bats are often the pollinators of nocturnal flowers such as agave, guava, and morning glory.
7.32.217	The flowers are usually large and white or pale-colored; thus, they can be distinguished from the dark surroundings at night.
7.32.218	The flowers have a strong, fruity, or musky fragrance and produce large amounts of nectar.
7.32.219	They are naturally large and wide-mouthed to accommodate the head of the bat.
7.32.220	As the bats seek the nectar, their faces and heads become covered with pollen, which is then transferred to the next flower.
7.32.221	Pollination by Birds
7.32.222	Many species of small birds, such as the hummingbird (Figure 32.14) and sun birds, are pollinators for plants such as orchids and other wildflowers.
7.32.223	Flowers visited by birds are usually sturdy and are oriented in such a way as to allow the birds to stay near the flower without getting their wings entangled in the nearby flowers.
7.32.224	The flower typically has a curved, tubular shape, which allows access for the bird’s beak.
7.32.225	Brightly colored, odorless flowers that are open during the day are pollinated by birds.
7.32.226	As a bird seeks energy-rich nectar, pollen is deposited on the bird’s head and neck and is then transferred to the next flower it visits.
7.32.227	Botanists have been known to determine the range of extinct plants by collecting and identifying pollen from 200-year-old bird specimens from the same site.
7.32.228	Hummingbirds have adaptations that allow them to reach the nectar of certain tubular flowers.
7.32.229	Pollination by Wind
7.32.230	Most species of conifers, and many angiosperms, such as grasses, maples and oaks, are pollinated by wind.
7.32.231	Pine cones are brown and unscented, while the flowers of wind-pollinated angiosperm species are usually green, small, may have small or no petals, and produce large amounts of pollen.
7.32.232	Unlike the typical insect-pollinated flowers, flowers adapted to pollination by wind do not produce nectar or scent.
7.32.233	In wind-pollinated species, the microsporangia hang out of the flower, and, as the wind blows, the lightweight pollen is carried with it (Figure 32.15).
7.32.234	The flowers usually emerge early in the spring, before the leaves, so that the leaves do not block the movement of the wind.
7.32.235	The pollen is deposited on the exposed feathery stigma of the flower (Figure 32.16).
7.32.236	These male (a) and female (b) catkins are from the goat willow tree (Salix caprea).
7.32.237	Note how both structures are light and feathery to better disperse and catch the wind-blown pollen.
7.32.238	Pollination by Water
7.32.239	Some weeds, such as Australian sea grass and pond weeds, are pollinated by water.
7.32.240	The pollen floats on water, and when it comes into contact with the flower, it is deposited inside the flower.
7.32.241	Double Fertilization
7.32.242	After pollen is deposited on the stigma, it must germinate and grow through the style to reach the ovule.
7.32.243	The microspores, or the pollen, contain two cells: the pollen tube cell and the generative cell.
7.32.244	The pollen tube cell grows into a pollen tube through which the generative cell travels.
7.32.245	The germination of the pollen tube requires water, oxygen, and certain chemical signals.
7.32.246	As it travels through the style to reach the embryo sac, the pollen tube’s growth is supported by the tissues of the style.
7.32.247	In the meantime, if the generative cell has not already split into two cells, it now divides to form two sperm cells.
7.32.248	The pollen tube is guided by the chemicals secreted by the synergids present in the embryo sac, and it enters the ovule sac through the micropyle.
7.32.249	Of the two sperm cells, one sperm fertilizes the egg cell, forming a diploid zygote; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm.
7.32.250	Together, these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization (Figure 32.18).
7.32.251	After fertilization is complete, no other sperm can enter.
7.32.252	The fertilized ovule forms the seed, whereas the tissues of the ovary become the fruit, usually enveloping the seed.
7.32.253	In angiosperms, one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the 2n zygote, and the other sperm fertilizes the central cell to form the 3n endosperm.
7.32.254	This is called a double fertilization.
7.32.255	After fertilization, the zygote divides to form two cells: the upper cell, or terminal cell, and the lower, or basal, cell.
7.32.256	The division of the basal cell gives rise to the suspensor, which eventually makes connection with the maternal tissue.
7.32.257	The suspensor provides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing embryo.
7.32.258	The terminal cell also divides, giving rise to a globular-shaped proembryo (Figure 32.19a).
7.32.259	In dicots (eudicots), the developing embryo has a heart shape, due to the presence of the two rudimentary cotyledons (Figure 32.19b).
7.32.260	In non-endospermic dicots, such as Capsella bursa, the endosperm develops initially, but is then digested, and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons.
7.32.261	As the embryo and cotyledons enlarge, they run out of room inside the developing seed, and are forced to bend (Figure 32.19c).
7.32.262	Ultimately, the embryo and cotyledons fill the seed (Figure 32.19d), and the seed is ready for dispersal.
7.32.263	Embryonic development is suspended after some time, and growth is resumed only when the seed germinates.
7.32.264	The developing seedling will rely on the food reserves stored in the cotyledons until the first set of leaves begin photosynthesis.
7.32.265	Shown are the stages of embryo development in the ovule of a shepherd’s purse (Capsella bursa).
7.32.266	After fertilization, the zygote divides to form an upper terminal cell and a lower basal cell.
7.32.267	(a)
7.32.268	In the first stage of development, the terminal cell divides, forming a globular pro-embryo.
7.32.269	The basal cell also divides, giving rise to the suspensor.
7.32.270	(b)
7.32.271	In the second stage, the developing embryo has a heart shape due to the presence of cotyledons.
7.32.272	(c)
7.32.273	In the third stage, the growing embryo runs out of room and starts to bend.
7.32.274	(d)
7.32.275	Eventually, it completely fills the seed.
7.32.276	(credit: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell) Development of the Seed
7.32.277	The mature ovule develops into the seed.
7.32.278	A typical seed contains a seed coat, cotyledons, endosperm, and a single embryo.
7.32.279	The storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots.
7.32.280	In monocots, such as corn and wheat, the single cotyledon is called a scutellum; the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue (xylem and phloem).
7.32.281	Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm.
7.32.282	Upon germination, enzymes are secreted by the aleurone, a single layer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo.
7.32.283	The enzymes degrade the stored carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, the products of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature strand to the developing embryo.
7.32.284	Therefore, the scutellum can be seen to be an absorptive organ, not a storage organ.
7.32.285	The two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo.
7.32.286	In endospermic dicots, the food reserves are stored in the endosperm.
7.32.287	During germination, the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the enzymatically released food reserves, much like in monocots (monocots, by definition, also have endospermic seeds).
7.32.288	Tobacco (Nicotiana tabaccum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and pepper (Capsicum annuum) are examples of endospermic dicots.
7.32.289	In non-endospermic dicots, the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization, but the endosperm food reserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage.
7.32.290	The two halves of a peanut seed (Arachis hypogaea) and the split peas (Pisum sativum) of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves.
7.32.291	The seed, along with the ovule, is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac.
7.32.292	In dicots, the seed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as the testa and inner coat known as the tegmen.
7.32.293	The embryonic axis consists of three parts: the plumule, the radicle, and the hypocotyl.
7.32.294	The portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl (hypocotyl means “below the cotyledons”).
7.32.295	The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle (the embryonic root), which is the region from which the root will develop.
7.32.296	In dicots, the hypocotyls extend above ground, giving rise to the stem of the plant.
7.32.297	In monocots, the hypocotyl does not show above ground because monocots do not exhibit stem elongation.
7.32.298	The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl.
7.32.299	The plumule is composed of the epicotyl, young leaves, and the shoot apical meristem.
7.32.300	Upon germination in dicot seeds, the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards.
7.32.301	This shape is called the plumule hook, and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark.
7.32.302	Therefore, as the epicotyl pushes through the tough and abrasive soil, the plumule is protected from damage.
7.32.303	Upon exposure to light, the hypocotyl hook straightens out, the young foliage leaves face the sun and expand, and the epicotyl continues to elongate.
7.32.304	During this time, the radicle is also growing and producing the primary root.
7.32.305	As it grows downward to form the tap root, lateral roots branch off to all sides, producing the typical dicot tap root system.
7.32.306	In monocot seeds (Figure 32.21), the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused.
7.32.307	As the seed germinates, the primary root emerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza.
7.32.308	Next, the primary shoot emerges, protected by the coleoptile: the covering of the shoot tip.
7.32.309	Upon exposure to light (i.e. when the plumule has exited the soil and the protective coleoptile is no longer needed), elongation of the coleoptile ceases and the leaves expand and unfold.
7.32.310	At the other end of the embryonic axis, the primary root soon dies, while other, adventitious roots (roots that do not arise from the usual place – i.e. the root) emerge from the base of the stem.
7.32.311	This gives the monocot a fibrous root system.
7.32.312	As this monocot grass seed germinates, the primary root, or radicle, emerges first, followed by the primary shoot, or coleoptile, and the adventitious roots.
7.32.313	Seed Germination
7.32.314	Many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity, or extremely low metabolic activity: a process known as dormancy, which may last for months, years or even centuries.
7.32.315	Dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions.
7.32.316	Upon a return to favorable conditions, seed germination takes place.
7.32.317	Favorable conditions could be as diverse as moisture, light, cold, fire, or chemical treatments.
7.32.318	After heavy rains, many new seedlings emerge.
7.32.319	Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings.
7.32.320	Some seeds require vernalization (cold treatment) before they can germinate.
7.32.321	This guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate climates will not germinate until the spring.
7.32.322	Plants growing in hot climates may have seeds that need a heat treatment in order to germinate, to avoid germination in the hot, dry summers.
7.32.323	In many seeds, the presence of a thick seed coat retards the ability to germinate.
7.32.324	Scarification, which includes mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat, is often employed before germination.
7.32.325	Presoaking in hot water, or passing through an acid environment, such as an animal’s digestive tract, may also be employed.
7.32.326	Depending on seed size, the time taken for a seedling to emerge may vary.
7.32.327	Species with large seeds have enough food reserves to germinate deep below ground, and still extend their epicotyl all the way to the soil surface.
7.32.328	Seeds of small- seeded species usually require light as a germination cue.
7.32.329	This ensures the seeds only germinate at or near the soil surface (where the light is greatest).
7.32.330	If they were to germinate too far underneath the surface, the developing seedling would not have enough food reserves to reach the sunlight.
7.32.331	Development of Fruit and Fruit Types
7.32.332	After fertilization, the ovary of the flower usually develops into the fruit.
7.32.333	Fruits are usually associated with having a sweet taste; however, not all fruits are sweet.
7.32.334	Botanically, the term “fruit” is used for a ripened ovary.
7.32.335	In most cases, flowers in which fertilization has taken place will develop into fruits, and flowers in which fertilization has not taken place will not.
7.32.336	Some fruits develop from the ovary and are known as true fruits, whereas others develop from other parts of the female gametophyte and are known as accessory fruits.
7.32.337	The fruit encloses the seeds and the developing embryo, thereby providing it with protection.
7.32.338	Fruits are of many types, depending on their origin and texture.
7.32.339	The sweet tissue of the blackberry, the red flesh of the tomato, the shell of the peanut, and the hull of corn (the tough, thin part that gets stuck in your teeth when you eat popcorn) are all fruits.
7.32.340	As the fruit matures, the seeds also mature.
7.32.341	Fruits may be classified as simple, aggregate, multiple, or accessory, depending on their origin (Figure 32.22).
7.32.342	If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary, it is known as a simple fruit, as seen in nuts and beans.
7.32.343	An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel, but all are in the same flower: the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit, as seen in the raspberry.
7.32.344	Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers.
7.32.345	An example is the pineapple, where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit.
7.32.346	Accessory fruits (sometimes called false fruits) are not derived from the ovary, but from another part of the flower, such as the receptacle (strawberry) or the hypanthium (apples and pears).
7.32.347	Figure 32.22
7.32.348	There are four main types of fruits.
7.32.349	Simple fruits, such as these nuts, are derived from a single ovary.
7.32.350	Aggregate fruits, like raspberries, form from many carpels that fuse together.
7.32.351	Multiple fruits, such as pineapple, form from a cluster of flowers called an inflorescence.
7.32.352	Accessory fruit, like the apple, are formed from a part of the plant other than the ovary.
7.32.353	(credit "nuts": modification of work by Petr Kratochvil; credit "raspberries": modification of work by Cory Zanker; credit "pineapple": modification of work by Howie Le; credit "apple": modification of work by Paolo Neo)
7.32.354	Fruits generally have three parts: the exocarp (the outermost skin or covering), the mesocarp (middle part of the fruit), and the endocarp (the inner part of the fruit).
7.32.355	Together, all three are known as the pericarp.
7.32.356	The mesocarp is usually the fleshy, edible part of the fruit; however, in some fruits, such as the almond, the endocarp is the edible part.
7.32.357	In many fruits, two or all three of the layers are fused, and are indistinguishable at maturity.
7.32.358	Fruits can be dry or fleshy.
7.32.359	Furthermore, fruits can be divided into dehiscent or indehiscent types.
7.32.360	Dehiscent fruits, such as peas, readily release their seeds, while indehiscent fruits, like peaches, rely on decay to release their seeds.
7.32.361	Fruit and Seed Dispersal
7.32.362	The fruit has a single purpose: seed dispersal.
7.32.363	Seeds contained within fruits need to be dispersed far from the mother plant, so they may find favorable and less competitive conditions in which to germinate and grow.
7.32.364	Some fruit have built-in mechanisms so they can disperse by themselves, whereas others require the help of agents like wind, water, and animals (Figure 32.23).
7.32.365	Modifications in seed structure, composition, and size help in dispersal.
7.32.366	Wind- dispersed fruit are lightweight and may have wing-like appendages that allow them to be carried by the wind.
7.32.367	Some have a parachute-like structure to keep them afloat.
7.32.368	Some fruits—for example, the dandelion—have hairy, weightless structures that are suited to dispersal by wind.
7.32.369	Seeds dispersed by water are contained in light and buoyant fruit, giving them the ability to float.
7.32.370	Coconuts are well known for their ability to float on water to reach land where they can germinate.
7.32.371	Similarly, willow and silver birches produce lightweight fruit that can float on water.
7.32.372	Animals and birds eat fruits, and the seeds that are not digested are excreted in their droppings some distance away.
7.32.373	Some animals, like squirrels, bury seed-containing fruits for later use; if the squirrel does not find its stash of fruit, and if conditions are favorable, the seeds germinate.
7.32.374	Some fruits, like the cocklebur, have hooks or sticky structures that stick to an animal's coat and are then transported to another place.
7.32.375	Humans also play a big role in dispersing seeds when they carry fruits to new places and throw away the inedible part that contains the seeds.
7.32.376	All of the above mechanisms allow for seeds to be dispersed through space, much like an animal’s offspring can move to a new location.
7.32.377	Seed dormancy, which was described earlier, allows plants to disperse their progeny through time: something animals cannot do.
7.32.378	Dormant seeds can wait months, years, or even decades for the proper conditions for germination and propagation of the species.
7.32.379	Fruits and seeds are dispersed by various means.
7.32.380	(a) Dandelion seeds are dispersed by wind, the (b) coconut seed is dispersed by water, and the (c) acorn is dispersed by animals that cache and then forget it.

7.32.382	Many plants are able to propagate themselves using asexual reproduction.
7.32.383	This method does not require the investment required to produce a flower, attract pollinators, or find a means of seed dispersal.
7.32.384	Asexual reproduction produces plants that are genetically identical to the parent plant because no mixing of male and female gametes takes place.
7.32.385	Traditionally, these plants survive well under stable environmental conditions when compared with plants produced from sexual reproduction because they carry genes identical to those of their parents.
7.32.386	Many different types of roots exhibit asexual reproduction Figure 32.24.
7.32.387	The corm is used by gladiolus and garlic.
7.32.388	Bulbs, such as a scaly bulb in lilies and a tunicate bulb in daffodils, are other common examples.
7.32.389	A potato is a stem tuber, while parsnip propagates from a taproot.
7.32.390	Ginger and iris produce rhizomes, while ivy uses an adventitious root (a root arising from a plant part other than the main or primary root), and the strawberry plant has a stolon, which is also called a runner.
7.32.391	Different types of stems allow for asexual reproduction.
7.32.392	(a)
7.32.393	The corm of a garlic plant looks similar to (b) a tulip bulb, but the corm is solid tissue, while the bulb consists of layers of modified leaves that surround an underground stem.
7.32.394	Both corms and bulbs can self-propagate, giving rise to new plants.
7.32.395	(c) Ginger forms masses of stems called rhizomes that can give rise to multiple plants.
7.32.396	(d)
7.32.397	Potato plants form fleshy stem tubers.
7.32.398	Each eye in the stem tuber can give rise to a new plant.
7.32.399	(e) Strawberry plants form stolons: stems that grow at the soil surface or just below ground and can give rise to new plants.

7.32.402	Some plants can produce seeds without fertilization.
7.32.403	Either the ovule or part of the ovary, which is diploid in nature, gives rise to a new seed.
7.32.404	This method of reproduction is known as apomixis.
7.32.405	An advantage of asexual reproduction is that the resulting plant will reach maturity faster.
7.32.406	Since the new plant is arising from an adult plant or plant parts, it will also be sturdier than a seedling.
7.32.407	Asexual reproduction can take place by natural or artificial (assisted by humans) means.
7.32.408	Natural Methods of Asexual Reproduction Natural methods of asexual reproduction include strategies that plants have developed to self-propagate.
7.32.409	Many plants—like ginger, onion, gladioli, and dahlia—continue to grow from buds that are present on the surface of the stem.
7.32.410	In some plants, such as the sweet potato, adventitious roots or runners can give rise to new plants Figure 32.25.
7.32.411	In Bryophyllum and kalanchoe, the leaves have small buds on their margins.
7.32.412	When these are detached from the plant, they grow into independent plants; or, they may start growing into independent plants if the leaf touches the soil.
7.32.413	Some plants can be propagated through cuttings alone.
7.32.414	Artificial Methods of Asexual Reproduction
7.32.415	These methods are frequently employed to give rise to new, and sometimes novel, plants.
7.32.416	They include grafting, cutting, layering, and micropropagation.
7.32.417	Grafting Grafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses, citrus species, and other plants.
7.32.418	In grafting, two plant species are used; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock.
7.32.419	The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion.
7.32.420	Both are cut at an oblique angle (any angle other than a right angle), placed in close contact with each other, and are then held together Figure 32.26.
7.32.421	Matching up these two surfaces as closely as possible is extremely important because these will be holding the plant together.
7.32.422	The vascular systems of the two plants grow and fuse, forming a graft.
7.32.423	After a period of time, the scion starts producing shoots, and eventually starts bearing flowers and fruits.
7.32.424	Grafting is widely used in viticulture (grape growing) and the citrus industry.
7.32.425	Scions capable of producing a particular fruit variety are grated onto root stock with specific resistance to disease.
7.32.426	Grafting is an artificial method of asexual reproduction used to produce plants combining favorable stem characteristics with favorable root characteristics.
7.32.427	The stem of the plant to be grafted is known as the scion, and the root is called the stock.
7.32.428	Cutting Plants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stem cuttings, where a portion of the stem containing nodes and internodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root.
7.32.429	In some species, stems can start producing a root even when placed only in water.
7.32.430	For example, leaves of the African violet will root if kept in water undisturbed for several weeks.
7.32.431	Layering Layering is a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil.
7.32.432	Young stems that can be bent easily without any injury are preferred.
7.32.433	Jasmine and bougainvillea (paper flower) can be propagated this way Figure 32.27.
7.32.434	In some plants, a modified form of layering known as air layering is employed.
7.32.435	A portion of the bark or outermost covering of the stem is removed and covered with moss, which is then taped.
7.32.436	Some gardeners also apply rooting hormone.
7.32.437	After some time, roots will appear, and this portion of the plant can be removed and transplanted into a separate pot.
7.32.438	In layering, a part of the stem is buried so that it forms a new plant.
7.32.439	(credit: modification of work by Pearson Scott Foresman, donated to the Wikimedia Foundation) Micropropagation Micropropagation (also called plant tissue culture) is a method of propagating a large number of plants from a single plant in a short time under laboratory conditions Figure 32.28.
7.32.440	This method allows propagation of rare, endangered species that may be difficult to grow under natural conditions, are economically important, or are in demand as disease-free plants.
7.32.441	Figure 32.28 Micropropagation is used to propagate plants in sterile conditions.
7.32.442	(credit: Nikhilesh Sanyal)
7.32.443	To start plant tissue culture, a part of the plant such as a stem, leaf, embryo, anther, or seed can be used.
7.32.444	The plant material is thoroughly sterilized using a combination of chemical treatments standardized for that species.
7.32.445	Under sterile conditions, the plant material is placed on a plant tissue culture medium that contains all the minerals, vitamins, and hormones required by the plant.
7.32.446	The plant part often gives rise to an undifferentiated mass known as callus, from which individual plantlets begin to grow after a period of time.
7.32.447	These can be separated and are first grown under greenhouse conditions before they are moved to field conditions.
7.32.448	Plant Life Spans
7.32.449	The length of time from the beginning of development to the death of a plant is called its life span.
7.32.450	The life cycle, on the other hand, is the sequence of stages a plant goes through from seed germination to seed production of the mature plant.
7.32.451	Some plants, such as annuals, only need a few weeks to grow, produce seeds and die.
7.32.452	Other plants, such as the bristlecone pine, live for thousands of years.
7.32.453	Some bristlecone pines have a documented age of 4,500 years Figure 32.29.
7.32.454	Even as some parts of a plant, such as regions containing meristematic tissue—the area of active plant growth consisting of undifferentiated cells capable of cell division—continue to grow, some parts undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis).
7.32.455	The cork found on stems, and the water-conducting tissue of the xylem, for example, are composed of dead cells.
7.32.456	The bristlecone pine, shown here in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest in the White Mountains of eastern California, has been known to live for 4,500 years.
7.32.457	(credit: Rick Goldwaser) Plant species that complete their lifecycle in one season are known as annuals, an example of which is Arabidopsis, or mouse-ear cress.
7.32.458	Biennials such as carrots complete their lifecycle in two seasons.
7.32.459	In a biennial’s first season, the plant has a vegetative phase, whereas in the next season, it completes its reproductive phase.
7.32.460	Commercial growers harvest the carrot roots after the first year of growth, and do not allow the plants to flower.
7.32.461	Perennials, such as the magnolia, complete their lifecycle in two years or more.
7.32.462	In another classification based on flowering frequency, monocarpic plants flower only once in their lifetime; examples include bamboo and yucca.
7.32.463	During the vegetative period of their life cycle (which may be as long as 120 years in some bamboo species), these plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food material that will be required during their once-in-a-lifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization.
7.32.464	Soon after flowering, these plants die.
7.32.465	Polycarpic plants form flowers many times during their lifetime.
7.32.466	Fruit trees, such as apple and orange trees, are polycarpic; they flower every year.
7.32.467	Other polycarpic species, such as perennials, flower several times during their life span, but not each year.
7.32.468	By this means, the plant does not require all its nutrients to be channelled towards flowering each year.
7.32.469	As is the case with all living organisms, genetics and environmental conditions have a role to play in determining how long a plant will live.
7.32.470	Susceptibility to disease, changing environmental conditions, drought, cold, and competition for nutrients are some of the factors that determine the survival of a plant.
7.32.471	Plants continue to grow, despite the presence of dead tissue such as cork.
7.32.472	Individual parts of plants, such as flowers and leaves, have different rates of survival.
7.32.473	In many trees, the older leaves turn yellow and eventually fall from the tree.
7.32.474	Leaf fall is triggered by factors such as a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency, due to shading by upper leaves, or oxidative damage incurred as a result of photosynthetic reactions.
7.32.475	The components of the part to be shed are recycled by the plant for use in other processes, such as development of seed and storage.
7.32.476	This process is known as nutrient recycling.
7.32.477	The aging of a plant and all the associated processes is known as senescence, which is marked by several complex biochemical changes.
7.32.478	One of the characteristics of senescence is the breakdown of chloroplasts, which is characterized by the yellowing of leaves.
7.32.479	The chloroplasts contain components of photosynthetic machinery such as membranes and proteins.
7.32.480	Chloroplasts also contain DNA.
7.32.481	The proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids are broken down by specific enzymes into smaller molecules and salvaged by the plant to support the growth of other plant tissues.
7.32.482	The complex pathways of nutrient recycling within a plant are not well understood.
7.32.483	Hormones are known to play a role in senescence.
7.32.484	Applications of cytokinins and ethylene delay or prevent senescence; in contrast, abscissic acid causes premature onset of senescence.         
7.33.0	An arctic fox is a complex animal, well adapted to its environment.
7.33.1	It changes coat color with the seasons, and has longer fur in winter to trap heat.

7.33.3	Introduction
7.33.4	The arctic fox is an example of a complex animal that has adapted to its environment and illustrates the relationships between an animal’s form and function.
7.33.5	The structures of animals consist of primary tissues that make up more complex organs and organ systems.
7.33.6	Homeostasis allows an animal to maintain a balance between its internal and external environments.
7.33.7	Animals vary in form and function.
7.33.8	From a sponge to a worm to a goat, an organism has a distinct body plan that limits its size and shape.
7.33.9	Animals’ bodies are also designed to interact with their environments, whether in the deep sea, a rainforest canopy, or the desert.
7.33.10	Therefore, a large amount of information about the structure of an organism's body (anatomy) and the function of its cells, tissues and organs (physiology) can be learned by studying that organism's environment.
7.33.11	Body Plans Animals exhibit different types of body symmetry.
7.33.12	The sponge is asymmetrical, the sea anemone has radial symmetry, and the goat has bilateral symmetry.
7.33.13	Animal body plans follow set patterns related to symmetry.
7.33.14	They are asymmetrical, radial, or bilateral in form as illustrated in Figure 33.2.
7.33.15	Asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry; an example of an asymmetrical animal is a sponge.
7.33.16	Radial symmetry, as illustrated in Figure 33.2, describes when an animal has an up-and-down orientation: any plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal halves, but not a definite right or left side.
7.33.17	This plan is found mostly in aquatic animals, especially organisms that attach themselves to a base, like a rock or a boat, and extract their food from the surrounding water as it flows around the organism.
7.33.18	Bilateral symmetry is illustrated in the same figure by a goat.
7.33.19	The goat also has an upper and lower component to it, but a plane cut from front to back separates the animal into definite right and left sides.
7.33.20	Additional terms used when describing positions in the body are anterior (front), posterior (rear), dorsal (toward the back), and ventral (toward the stomach).
7.33.21	Bilateral symmetry is found in both land-based and aquatic animals; it enables a high level of mobility.
7.33.22	Limits on Animal Size and Shape Animals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape: this is a tubular shaped body that is tapered at both ends.
7.33.23	This shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and allows the animal to swim at high speeds.
7.33.24	Table 33.1 lists the maximum speed of various animals.
7.33.25	Certain types of sharks can swim at fifty kilometers an hour and some dolphins at 32 to 40 kilometers per hour.
7.33.26	Land animals frequently travel faster, although the tortoise and snail are significantly slower than cheetahs.
7.33.27	Another difference in the adaptations of aquatic and land-dwelling organisms is that aquatic organisms are constrained in shape by the forces of drag in the water since water has higher viscosity than air.
7.33.28	On the other hand, land-dwelling organisms are constrained mainly by gravity, and drag is relatively unimportant.
7.33.29	For example, most adaptations in birds are for gravity not for drag.
7.33.30	Most animals have an exoskeleton, including insects, spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, centipedes, and crustaceans.
7.33.31	Scientists estimate that, of insects alone, there are over 30 million species on our planet.
7.33.32	The exoskeleton is a hard covering or shell that provides benefits to the animal, such as protection against damage from predators and from water loss (for land animals); it also provides for the attachments of muscles.
7.33.33	As the tough and resistant outer cover of an arthropod, the exoskeleton may be constructed of a tough polymer such as chitin and is often biomineralized with materials such as calcium carbonate.
7.33.34	This is fused to the animal’s epidermis.
7.33.35	Ingrowths of the exoskeleton, called apodemes, function as attachment sites for muscles, similar to tendons in more advanced animals (Figure 33.3).
7.33.36	In order to grow, the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the original covering.
7.33.37	This limits the animal’s ability to grow continually, and may limit the individual’s ability to mature if molting does not occur at the proper time.
7.33.38	The thickness of the exoskeleton must be increased significantly to accommodate any increase in weight.
7.33.39	It is estimated that a doubling of body size increases body weight by a factor of eight.
7.33.40	The increasing thickness of the chitin necessary to support this weight limits most animals with an exoskeleton to a relatively small size.
7.33.41	The same principles apply to endoskeletons, but they are more efficient because muscles are attached on the outside, making it easier to compensate for increased mass.
7.33.42	Figure 33.3
7.33.43	Apodemes are ingrowths on arthropod exoskeletons to which muscles attach.
7.33.44	The apodemes on this crab leg are located above and below the fulcrum of the claw.
7.33.45	Contraction of muscles attached to the apodemes pulls the claw closed.
7.33.46	An animal with an endoskeleton has its size determined by the amount of skeletal system it needs in order to support the other tissues and the amount of muscle it needs for movement.
7.33.47	As the body size increases, both bone and muscle mass increase.
7.33.48	The speed achievable by the animal is a balance between its overall size and the bone and muscle that provide support and movement.
7.33.49	Limiting Effects of Diffusion on Size and Development
7.33.50	The exchange of nutrients and wastes between a cell and its watery environment occurs through the process of diffusion.
7.33.51	All living cells are bathed in liquid, whether they are in a single-celled organism or a multicellular one.
7.33.52	Diffusion is effective over a specific distance and limits the size that an individual cell can attain.
7.33.53	If a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such as an amoeba, it can satisfy all of its nutrient and waste needs through diffusion.
7.33.54	If the cell is too large, then diffusion is ineffective and the center of the cell does not receive adequate nutrients nor is it able to effectively dispel its waste.
7.33.55	An important concept in understanding how efficient diffusion is as a means of transport is the surface to volume ratio.
7.33.56	Recall that any three-dimensional object has a surface area and volume; the ratio of these two quantities is the surface- to-volume ratio.
7.33.57	Consider a cell shaped like a perfect sphere: it has a surface area of 4πr2, and a volume of (4/3)πr3.
7.33.58	The surface-to-volume ratio of a sphere is 3/r; as the cell gets bigger, its surface to volume ratio decreases, making diffusion less efficient.
7.33.59	The larger the size of the sphere, or animal, the less surface area for diffusion it possesses.
7.33.60	The solution to producing larger organisms is for them to become multicellular.
7.33.61	Specialization occurs in complex organisms, allowing cells to become more efficient at doing fewer tasks.
7.33.62	For example, circulatory systems bring nutrients and remove waste, while respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon dioxide from them.
7.33.63	Other organ systems have developed further specialization of cells and tissues and efficiently control body functions.
7.33.64	Moreover, surface-to- volume ratio applies to other areas of animal development, such as the relationship between muscle mass and cross-sectional surface area in supporting skeletons, and in the relationship between muscle mass and the generation of dissipation of heat.
7.33.65	Animal Bioenergetics
7.33.66	All animals must obtain their energy from food they ingest or absorb.
7.33.67	These nutrients are converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for short-term storage and use by all cells.
7.33.68	Some animals store energy for slightly longer times as glycogen, and others store energy for much longer times in the form of triglycerides housed in specialized adipose tissues.
7.33.69	No energy system is one hundred percent efficient, and an animal’s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat.
7.33.70	If an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature, it is classified as a warm-blooded animal and called an endotherm.
7.33.71	The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur, fat, or feathers.
7.33.72	The absence of insulation in ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat.
7.33.73	The amount of energy expended by an animal over a specific time is called its metabolic rate.
7.33.74	The rate is measured variously in joules, calories, or kilocalories (1000 calories).
7.33.75	Carbohydrates and proteins contain about 4.5 to 5 kcal/g, and fat contains about 9 kcal/g.
7.33.76	Metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate (BMR) in endothermic animals at rest and as the standard metabolic rate (SMR) in ectotherms.
7.33.77	Human males have a BMR of 1600 to 1800 kcal/day, and human females have a BMR of 1300 to 1500 kcal/day.
7.33.78	Even with insulation, endothermal animals require extensive amounts of energy to maintain a constant body temperature.
7.33.79	An ectotherm such as an alligator has an SMR of 60 kcal/day.
7.33.80	Energy Requirements Related to Body Size
7.33.81	Smaller endothermic animals have a greater surface area for their mass than larger ones (Figure 33.4).
7.33.82	Therefore, smaller animals lose heat at a faster rate than larger animals and require more energy to maintain a constant internal temperature.
7.33.83	This results in a smaller endothermic animal having a higher BMR, per body weight, than a larger endothermic animal.
7.33.84	The mouse has a much higher metabolic rate than the elephant.

7.33.90	Energy Requirements Related to Levels of Activity
7.33.91	The more active an animal is, the more energy is needed to maintain that activity, and the higher its BMR or SMR.
7.33.92	The average daily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animal’s BMR or SMR.
7.33.93	Humans are more sedentary than most animals and have an average daily rate of only 1.5 times the BMR.
7.33.94	The diet of an endothermic animal is determined by its BMR.
7.33.95	For example: the type of grasses, leaves, or shrubs that an herbivore eats affects the number of calories that it takes in.
7.33.96	The relative caloric content of herbivore foods, in descending order, is tall grasses > legumes > short grasses
7.33.97	> forbs (any broad-leaved plant, not a grass)
7.33.98	> subshrubs > annuals/biennials.
7.33.99	Energy Requirements Related to Environment Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor.
7.33.100	Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions.
7.33.101	Torpor can be used by animals for long periods, such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature.
7.33.102	During hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0° C (32° F), while a bear’s internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37° C (99° F).
7.33.103	If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is called estivation.
7.33.104	Some desert animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year.
7.33.105	Torpor can occur on a daily basis; this is seen in bats and hummingbirds.
7.33.106	While endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio, some organisms can be smaller and still be endotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day that is coldest.
7.33.107	This allows them to conserve energy during the colder parts of the day, when they consume more energy to maintain their body temperature.
7.33.108	Animal Body Planes and Cavities A standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes.
7.33.109	A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions.
7.33.110	A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle, making two equal right and left halves.
7.33.111	A frontal plane (also called a coronal plane) separates the front from the back.
7.33.112	A transverse plane (or, horizontal plane) divides the animal into upper and lower portions.
7.33.113	This is sometimes called a cross section, and, if the transverse cut is at an angle, it is called an oblique plane.
7.33.114	Figure 33.5 illustrates these planes on a goat (a four-legged animal) and a human being.
7.33.115	Shown are the planes of a quadruped goat and a bipedal human.
7.33.116	The midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in half, into right and left portions.
7.33.117	The frontal plane divides the front and back, and the transverse plane divides the body into upper and lower portions.
7.33.118	Vertebrate animals have a number of defined body cavities, as illustrated in Figure 33.6.
7.33.119	Two of these are major cavities that contain smaller cavities within them.
7.33.120	The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral (or spinal) cavities.
7.33.121	The ventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity, which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity, which surrounds the heart.
7.33.122	The ventral cavity also contains the abdominopelvic cavity, which can be separated into the abdominal and the pelvic cavities.
7.33.123	Figure 33.6 Vertebrate animals have two major body cavities.
7.33.124	The dorsal cavity, indicated in green, contains the cranial and the spinal cavity.
7.33.125	The ventral cavity, indicated in yellow, contains the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity.
7.33.126	The thoracic cavity is separated from the abdominopelvic cavity by the diaphragm.
7.33.127	The thoracic cavity is separated into the abdominal cavity and the pelvic cavity by an imaginary line parallel to the pelvis bones.
7.33.128	(credit: modification of work by NCI)
7.33.129	The tissues of multicellular, complex animals are four primary types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous.
7.33.130	Recall that tissues are groups of similar cells group of similar cells carrying out related functions.
7.33.131	These tissues combine to form organs—like the skin or kidney—that have specific, specialized functions within the body.
7.33.132	Organs are organized into organ systems to perform functions; examples include the circulatory system, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, and the digestive system, consisting of several organs, including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas.
7.33.133	Organ systems come together to create an entire organism.
7.33.134	Epithelial Tissues Epithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or multiple layers of cells.
7.33.135	The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells.
7.33.136	Epithelia composed of a single layer of cells is called simple epithelia; epithelial tissue composed of multiple layers is called stratified epithelia.
7.33.137	Table 33.2 summarizes the different types of epithelial tissues.
7.33.138	Squamous Epithelia Squamous epithelial cells are generally round, flat, and have a small, centrally located nucleus.
7.33.139	The cell outline is slightly irregular, and cells fit together to form a covering or lining.
7.33.140	When the cells are arranged in a single layer (simple epithelia), they facilitate diffusion in tissues, such as the areas of gas exchange in the lungs and the exchange of nutrients and waste at blood capillaries.
7.33.141	Squamous epithelia cells (a) have a slightly irregular shape, and a small, centrally located nucleus.
7.33.142	These cells can be stratified into layers, as in (b) this human cervix specimen.
7.33.143	(credit b: modification of work by Ed Uthman; scale-bar data from Matt Russell) Figure 33.7a illustrates a layer of squamous cells with their membranes joined together to form an epithelium.
7.33.144	Image Figure 33.7b illustrates squamous epithelial cells arranged in stratified layers, where protection is needed on the body from outside abrasion and damage.
7.33.145	This is called a stratified squamous epithelium and occurs in the skin and in tissues lining the mouth and vagina.
7.33.146	Cuboidal Epithelia Cuboidal epithelial cells, shown in Figure 33.8, are cube-shaped with a single, central nucleus.
7.33.147	They are most commonly found in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and secrete glandular material.
7.33.148	They are also found in the walls of tubules and in the ducts of the kidney and liver.
7.33.149	Simple cuboidal epithelial cells line tubules in the mammalian kidney, where they are involved in filtering the blood.
7.33.150	Columnar Epithelia Columnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide: they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer, and are most commonly found in a single-layer arrangement.
7.33.151	The nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to be lined up at the base of the cells, as illustrated in Figure 33.9.
7.33.152	These cells absorb material from the lumen of the digestive tract and prepare it for entry into the body through the circulatory and lymphatic systems.
7.33.153	Simple columnar epithelial cells absorb material from the digestive tract.
7.33.154	Goblet cells secret mucous into the digestive tract lumen.
7.33.155	Columnar epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract appear to be stratified.
7.33.156	However, each cell is attached to the base membrane of the tissue and, therefore, they are simple tissues.
7.33.157	The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells, making it appear as though there is more than one layer, as seen in Figure 33.10.
7.33.158	This is called pseudostratified, columnar epithelia.
7.33.159	This cellular covering has cilia at the apical, or free, surface of the cells.
7.33.160	The cilia enhance the movement of mucous and trapped particles out of the respiratory tract, helping to protect the system from invasive microorganisms and harmful material that has been breathed into the body.
7.33.161	Goblet cells are interspersed in some tissues (such as the lining of the trachea).
7.33.162	The goblet cells contain mucous that traps irritants, which in the case of the trachea keep these irritants from getting into the lungs.
7.33.163	Pseudostratified columnar epithelia line the respiratory tract.
7.33.164	They exist in one layer, but the arrangement of nuclei at different levels makes it appear that there is more than one layer.
7.33.165	Goblet cells interspersed between the columnar epithelial cells secrete mucous into the respiratory tract.
7.33.166	Transitional Epithelia Transitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system, primarily in the bladder and ureter.
7.33.167	These cells are arranged in a stratified layer, but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed, empty bladder, as illustrated in Figure 33.11.
7.33.168	As the urinary bladder fills, the epithelial layer unfolds and expands to hold the volume of urine introduced into it.
7.33.169	As the bladder fills, it expands and the lining becomes thinner.
7.33.170	In other words, the tissue transitions from thick to thin.
7.33.171	Connective Tissues Connective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non-living substance, called the ground substance.
7.33.172	The ground substance is made of an organic substance (usually a protein) and an inorganic substance (usually a mineral or water).
7.33.173	The principal cell of connective tissues is the fibroblast.
7.33.174	This cell makes the fibers found in nearly all of the connective tissues.
7.33.175	Fibroblasts are motile, able to carry out mitosis, and can synthesize whichever connective tissue is needed.
7.33.176	Macrophages, lymphocytes, and, occasionally, leukocytes can be found in some of the tissues.
7.33.177	Some tissues have specialized cells that are not found in the others.
7.33.178	The matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density.
7.33.179	When a connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers, it has proportionally a less dense matrix.
7.33.180	The organic portion or protein fibers found in connective tissues are either collagen, elastic, or reticular fibers.
7.33.181	Collagen fibers provide strength to the tissue, preventing it from being torn or separated from the surrounding tissues.
7.33.182	Elastic fibers are made of the protein elastin; this fiber can stretch to one and one half of its length and return to its original size and shape.
7.33.183	Elastic fibers provide flexibility to the tissues.
7.33.184	Reticular fibers are the third type of protein fiber found in connective tissues.
7.33.185	This fiber consists of thin strands of collagen that form a network of fibers to support the tissue and other organs to which it is connected.
7.33.186	The various types of connective tissues, the types of cells and fibers they are made of, and sample locations of the tissues is summarized in Table 33.3.
7.33.187	Loose/Areolar Connective Tissue Loose connective tissue, also called areolar connective tissue, has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue.
7.33.188	As illustrated in Figure 33.12, loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts; macrophages are present as well.
7.33.189	Collagen fibers are relatively wide and stain a light pink, while elastic fibers are thin and stain dark blue to black.
7.33.190	The space between the formed elements of the tissue is filled with the matrix.
7.33.191	The material in the connective tissue gives it a loose consistency similar to a cotton ball that has been pulled apart.
7.33.192	Loose connective tissue is found around every blood vessel and helps to keep the vessel in place.
7.33.193	The tissue is also found around and between most body organs.
7.33.194	In summary, areolar tissue is tough, yet flexible, and comprises membranes.
7.33.195	Loose connective tissue is composed of loosely woven collagen and elastic fibers.
7.33.196	The fibers and other components of the connective tissue matrix are secreted by fibroblasts.
7.33.197	Fibrous Connective Tissue Fibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material.
7.33.198	The fibers can be arranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel.
7.33.199	Irregularly arranged fibrous connective tissues are found in areas of the body where stress occurs from all directions, such as the dermis of the skin.
7.33.200	Regular fibrous connective tissue, shown in Figure 33.13, is found in tendons (which connect muscles to bones) and ligaments (which connect bones to bones).
7.33.201	Fibrous connective tissue from the tendon has strands of collagen fibers lined up in parallel.
7.33.202	Cartilage Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers.
7.33.203	The cells, called chondrocytes, make the matrix and fibers of the tissue.
7.33.204	Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae.
7.33.205	A cartilage with few collagen and elastic fibers is hyaline cartilage, illustrated in Figure 33.14.
7.33.206	The lacunae are randomly scattered throughout the tissue and the matrix takes on a milky or scrubbed appearance with routine histological stains.
7.33.207	Sharks have cartilaginous skeletons, as does nearly the entire human skeleton during a specific pre-birth developmental stage.
7.33.208	A remnant of this cartilage persists in the outer portion of the human nose.
7.33.209	Hyaline cartilage is also found at the ends of long bones, reducing friction and cushioning the articulations of these bones.
7.33.210	Hyaline cartilage consists of a matrix with cells called chondrocytes embedded in it.
7.33.211	The chondrocytes exist in cavities in the matrix called lacunae.
7.33.212	Elastic cartilage has a large amount of elastic fibers, giving it tremendous flexibility.
7.33.213	The ears of most vertebrate animals contain this cartilage as do portions of the larynx, or voice box.
7.33.214	Fibrocartilage contains a large amount of collagen fibers, giving the tissue tremendous strength.
7.33.215	Fibrocartilage comprises the intervertebral discs in vertebrate animals.
7.33.216	Hyaline cartilage found in movable joints such as the knee and shoulder becomes damaged as a result of age or trauma.
7.33.217	Damaged hyaline cartilage is replaced by fibrocartilage and results in the joints becoming “stiff.
7.33.218	” Bone Bone, or osseous tissue, is a connective tissue that has a large amount of two different types of matrix material.
7.33.219	The organic matrix is similar to the matrix material found in other connective tissues, including some amount of collagen and elastic fibers.
7.33.220	This gives strength and flexibility to the tissue.
7.33.221	The inorganic matrix consists of mineral salts—mostly calcium salts—that give the tissue hardness.
7.33.222	Without adequate organic material in the matrix, the tissue breaks; without adequate inorganic material in the matrix, the tissue bends.
7.33.223	There are three types of cells in bone: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts.
7.33.224	Osteoblasts are active in making bone for growth and remodeling.
7.33.225	Osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and, after the matrix surrounds them, they continue to live, but in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes.
7.33.226	Osteocytes are found in lacunae of the bone.
7.33.227	Osteoclasts are active in breaking down bone for bone remodeling, and they provide access to calcium stored in tissues.
7.33.228	Osteoclasts are usually found on the surface of the tissue.
7.33.229	Bone can be divided into two types: compact and spongy.
7.33.230	Compact bone is found in the shaft (or diaphysis) of a long bone and the surface of the flat bones, while spongy bone is found in the end (or epiphysis) of a long bone.
7.33.231	Compact bone is organized into subunits called osteons, as illustrated in Figure 33.15.
7.33.232	A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal, with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae.
7.33.233	The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells.
7.33.234	Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength.
7.33.235	Over time, these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient.
7.33.236	Bone tissue forms the internal skeleton of vertebrate animals, providing structure to the animal and points of attachment for tendons.
7.33.237	Compact bone is a dense matrix on the outer surface of bone.
7.33.238	Spongy bone, inside the compact bone, is porous with web-like trabeculae.
7.33.239	(b) Compact bone is organized into rings called osteons.
7.33.240	Blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels are found in the central Haversian canal.
7.33.241	Rings of lamellae surround the Haversian canal.
7.33.242	Between the lamellae are cavities called lacunae.
7.33.243	Canaliculi are microchannels connecting the lacunae together.
7.33.244	(c)
7.33.245	Osteoblasts surround the exterior of the bone.
7.33.246	Osteoclasts bore tunnels into the bone and osteocytes are found in the lacunae.
7.33.247	Adipose Tissue Adipose tissue, or fat tissue, is considered a connective tissue even though it does not have fibroblasts or a real matrix and only has a few fibers.
7.33.248	Adipose tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes that collect and store fat in the form of triglycerides, for energy metabolism.
7.33.249	Adipose tissues additionally serve as insulation to help maintain body temperatures, allowing animals to be endothermic, and they function as cushioning against damage to body organs.
7.33.250	Under a microscope, adipose tissue cells appear empty due to the extraction of fat during the processing of the material for viewing, as seen in Figure 33.16.
7.33.251	The thin lines in the image are the cell membranes, and the nuclei are the small, black dots at the edges of the cells.
7.33.252	Adipose is a connective tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes.
7.33.253	Adipocytes have small nuclei localized at the cell edge.
7.33.254	Blood Blood is considered a connective tissue because it has a matrix, as shown in Figure 33.17.
7.33.255	The living cell types are red blood cells (RBC), also called erythrocytes, and white blood cells (WBC), also called leukocytes.
7.33.256	The fluid portion of whole blood, its matrix, is commonly called plasma.
7.33.257	Blood is a connective tissue that has a fluid matrix, called plasma, and no fibers.
7.33.258	Erythrocytes (red blood cells), the predominant cell type, are involved in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
7.33.259	Also present are various leukocytes (white blood cells) involved in immune response.
7.33.260	The cell found in greatest abundance in blood is the erythrocyte.
7.33.261	Erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood sample: the average number of red blood cells in primates is 4.7 to 5.5 million cells per microliter.
7.33.262	Erythrocytes are consistently the same size in a species, but vary in size between species.
7.33.263	For example, the average diameter of a primate red blood cell is 7.5 μl, a dog is close at 7.0 μl, but a cat’s RBC diameter is 5.9 μl.
7.33.264	Sheep erythrocytes are even smaller at 4.6 μl.
7.33.265	Mammalian erythrocytes lose their nuclei and mitochondria when they are released from the bone marrow where they are made.
7.33.266	Fish, amphibian, and avian red blood cells maintain their nuclei and mitochondria throughout the cell’s life.
7.33.267	The principal job of an erythrocyte is to carry and deliver oxygen to the tissues.
7.33.268	Leukocytes are the predominant white blood cells found in the peripheral blood.
7.33.269	Leukocytes are counted in the thousands in the blood with measurements expressed as ranges: primate counts range from 4,800 to 10,800 cells per μl, dogs from 5,600 to 19,200 cells per μl, cats from 8,000 to 25,000 cells per μl, cattle from 4,000 to 12,000 cells per μl, and pigs from 11,000 to 22,000 cells per μl.
7.33.270	Lymphocytes function primarily in the immune response to foreign antigens or material.
7.33.271	Different types of lymphocytes make antibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies.
7.33.272	Neutrophils are phagocytic cells and they participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial invaders, aiding in the removal of bacteria that has entered the body.
7.33.273	Another leukocyte that is found in the peripheral blood is the monocyte.
7.33.274	Monocytes give rise to phagocytic macrophages that clean up dead and damaged cells in the body, whether they are foreign or from the host animal.
7.33.275	Two additional leukocytes in the blood are eosinophils and basophils—both help to facilitate the inflammatory response.
7.33.276	The slightly granular material among the cells is a cytoplasmic fragment of a cell in the bone marrow.
7.33.277	This is called a platelet or thrombocyte.
7.33.278	Platelets participate in the stages leading up to coagulation of the blood to stop bleeding through damaged blood vessels.
7.33.279	Blood has a number of functions, but primarily it transports material through the body to bring nutrients to cells and remove waste material from them.
7.33.280	Muscle Tissues There are three types of muscle in animal bodies: smooth, skeletal, and cardiac.
7.33.281	They differ by the presence or absence of striations or bands, the number and location of nuclei, whether they are voluntarily or involuntarily controlled, and their location within the body.
7.33.282	Table 33.4 summarizes these differences.
7.33.283	Smooth Muscle Smooth muscle does not have striations in its cells.
7.33.284	It has a single, centrally located nucleus, as shown in Figure 33.18.
7.33.285	Constriction of smooth muscle occurs under involuntary, autonomic nervous control and in response to local conditions in the tissues.
7.33.286	Smooth muscle tissue is also called non-striated as it lacks the banded appearance of skeletal and cardiac muscle.
7.33.287	The walls of blood vessels, the tubes of the digestive system, and the tubes of the reproductive systems are composed of mostly smooth muscle.
7.33.288	Smooth muscle cells do not have striations, while skeletal muscle cells do.
7.33.289	Cardiac muscle cells have striations, but, unlike the multinucleate skeletal cells, they have only one nucleus.
7.33.290	Cardiac muscle tissue also has intercalated discs, specialized regions running along the plasma membrane that join adjacent cardiac muscle cells and assist in passing an electrical impulse from cell to cell.
7.33.291	Skeletal Muscle Skeletal muscle has striations across its cells caused by the arrangement of the contractile proteins actin and myosin.
7.33.292	These muscle cells are relatively long and have multiple nuclei along the edge of the cell.
7.33.293	Skeletal muscle is under voluntary, somatic nervous system control and is found in the muscles that move bones.
7.33.294	Figure 33.18 illustrates the histology of skeletal muscle.
7.33.295	Cardiac Muscle Cardiac muscle, shown in Figure 33.18, is found only in the heart.
7.33.296	Like skeletal muscle, it has cross striations in its cells, but cardiac muscle has a single, centrally located nucleus.
7.33.297	Cardiac muscle is not under voluntary control but can be influenced by the autonomic nervous system to speed up or slow down.
7.33.298	An added feature to cardiac muscle cells is a line than extends along the end of the cell as it abuts the next cardiac cell in the row.
7.33.299	This line is called an intercalated disc: it assists in passing electrical impulse efficiently from one cell to the next and maintains the strong connection between neighboring cardiac cells.
7.33.300	Nervous Tissues Nervous tissues are made of cells specialized to receive and transmit electrical impulses from specific areas of the body and to send them to specific locations in the body.
7.33.301	The main cell of the nervous system is the neuron, illustrated in Figure 33.19.
7.33.302	The large structure with a central nucleus is the cell body of the neuron.
7.33.303	Projections from the cell body are either dendrites specialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting impulses.
7.33.304	Some glial cells are also shown.
7.33.305	Astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently.
7.33.306	Other glial cells that are not shown support the nutritional and waste requirements of the neuron.
7.33.307	Some of the glial cells are phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue.
7.33.308	A nerve consists of neurons and glial cells.
7.33.309	The neuron has projections called dendrites that receive signals and projections called axons that send signals.
7.33.310	Also shown are two types of glial cells: astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently.
7.33.311	Animal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes through a process called homeostasis (“steady state”).
7.33.312	These changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures.
7.33.313	Homeostasis means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body.
7.33.314	It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the body’s systems encounter.
7.33.315	It is equilibrium because body functions are kept within specific ranges.
7.33.316	Even an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium.
7.33.317	Homeostatic Process
7.33.318	The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point.
7.33.319	While there are normal fluctuations from the set point, the body’s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point.
7.33.320	A change in the internal or external environment is called a stimulus and is detected by a receptor; the response of the system is to adjust the deviation parameter toward the set point.
7.33.321	For instance, if the body becomes too warm, adjustments are made to cool the animal.
7.33.322	If the blood’s glucose rises after a meal, adjustments are made to lower the blood glucose level by getting the nutrient into tissues that need it or to store it for later use.
7.33.323	Control of Homeostasis
7.33.324	When a change occurs in an animal’s environment, an adjustment must be made.
7.33.325	The receptor senses the change in the environment, then sends a signal to the control center (in most cases, the brain) which in turn generates a response that is signaled to an effector.
7.33.326	The effector is a muscle (that contracts or relaxes) or a gland that secretes.
7.33.327	Homeostatsis is maintained by negative feedback loops.
7.33.328	Positive feedback loops actually push the organism further out of homeostasis, but may be necessary for life to occur.
7.33.329	Homeostasis is controlled by the nervous and endocrine system of mammals.
7.33.330	Negative Feedback Mechanisms
7.33.331	Any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop.
7.33.332	It may either increase or decrease the stimulus, but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it.
7.33.333	In other words, if a level is too high, the body does something to bring it down, and conversely, if a level is too low, the body does something to make it go up.
7.33.334	Hence the term negative feedback.
7.33.335	An example is animal maintenance of blood glucose levels.
7.33.336	When an animal has eaten, blood glucose levels rise.
7.33.337	This is sensed by the nervous system.
7.33.338	Specialized cells in the pancreas sense this, and the hormone insulin is released by the endocrine system.
7.33.339	Insulin causes blood glucose levels to decrease, as would be expected in a negative feedback system, as illustrated in Figure 33.20.
7.33.340	However, if an animal has not eaten and blood glucose levels decrease, this is sensed in another group of cells in the pancreas, and the hormone glucagon is released causing glucose levels to increase.
7.33.341	This is still a negative feedback loop, but not in the direction expected by the use of the term “negative.
7.33.342	”
7.33.343	Another example of an increase as a result of the feedback loop is the control of blood calcium.
7.33.344	If calcium levels decrease, specialized cells in the parathyroid gland sense this and release parathyroid hormone (PTH), causing an increased absorption of calcium through the intestines and kidneys and, possibly, the breakdown of bone in order to liberate calcium.
7.33.345	The effects of PTH are to raise blood levels of the element.
7.33.346	Negative feedback loops are the predominant mechanism used in homeostasis.
7.33.347	Blood sugar levels are controlled by a negative feedback loop.

7.33.349	Positive Feedback Loop
7.33.350	A positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus, possibly accelerating it.
7.33.351	Few examples of positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies, but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting, or coagulation.
7.33.352	As one clotting factor is activated, it activates the next factor in sequence until a fibrin clot is achieved.
7.33.353	The direction is maintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback.
7.33.354	Another example of positive feedback is uterine contractions during childbirth, as illustrated in Figure 33.21.
7.33.355	The hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system, stimulates the contraction of the uterus.
7.33.356	This produces pain sensed by the nervous system.
7.33.357	Instead of lowering the oxytocin and causing the pain to subside, more oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth.
7.33.358	Set Point
7.33.359	It is possible to adjust a system’s set point.
7.33.360	When this happens, the feedback loop works to maintain the new setting.
7.33.361	An example of this is blood pressure: over time, the normal or set point for blood pressure can increase as a result of continued increases in blood pressure.
7.33.362	The body no longer recognizes the elevation as abnormal and no attempt is made to return to the lower set point.
7.33.363	The result is the maintenance of an elevated blood pressure that can have harmful effects on the body.
7.33.364	Medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level.
7.33.365	This is called a process of alteration of the set point in a feedback loop.
7.33.366	Changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system.
7.33.367	This is called acclimatization.
7.33.368	This occurs, for instance, when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to.
7.33.369	In order to adjust to the lower oxygen levels at the new altitude, the body increases the number of red blood cells circulating in the blood to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues.
7.33.370	Another example of acclimatization is animals that have seasonal changes in their coats: a heavier coat in the winter ensures adequate heat retention, and a light coat in summer assists in keeping body temperature from rising to harmful levels.
7.33.371	Homeostasis:
7.33.372	Thermoregulation Body temperature affects body activities.
7.33.373	Generally, as body temperature rises, enzyme activity rises as well.
7.33.374	For every ten degree centigrade rise in temperature, enzyme activity doubles, up to a point.
7.33.375	Body proteins, including enzymes, begin to denature and lose their function with high heat (around 50oC for mammals).
7.33.376	Enzyme activity will decrease by half for every ten degree centigrade drop in temperature, to the point of freezing, with a few exceptions.
7.33.377	Some fish can withstand freezing solid and return to normal with thawing.
7.33.378	Endotherms and Ectotherms Animals can be divided into two groups: some maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental temperatures, while others have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the environment.
7.33.379	Animals that do not control their body temperature are ectotherms.
7.33.380	This group has been called cold-blooded, but the term may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature.
7.33.381	In contrast to ectotherms, which rely on external temperatures to set their body temperatures, poikilotherms are animals with constantly varying internal temperatures.
7.33.382	An animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called a homeotherm.
7.33.383	Endotherms are animals that rely on internal sources for body temperature but which can exhibit extremes in temperature.
7.33.384	These animals are able to maintain a level of activity at cooler temperature, which an ectotherm cannot due to differing enzyme levels of activity.
7.33.385	Heat can be exchanged between an animal and its environment through four mechanisms: radiation, evaporation, convection, and conduction (Figure 33.22).
7.33.386	Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic “heat” waves.
7.33.387	Heat comes from the sun in this manner and radiates from dry skin the same way.
7.33.388	Heat can be removed with liquid from a surface during evaporation.
7.33.389	This occurs when a mammal sweats.
7.33.390	Convection currents of air remove heat from the surface of dry skin as the air passes over it.
7.33.391	Heat will be conducted from one surface to another during direct contact with the surfaces, such as an animal resting on a warm rock.
7.33.392	Heat can be exchanged by four mechanisms: (a) radiation, (b) evaporation, (c) convection, or (d) conduction.

7.33.396	Heat Conservation and Dissipation Animals conserve or dissipate heat in a variety of ways.
7.33.397	In certain climates, endothermic animals have some form of insulation, such as fur, fat, feathers, or some combination thereof.
7.33.398	Animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating layer of air between their skin and internal organs.
7.33.399	Polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and yet maintain a constant, warm, body temperature.
7.33.400	The arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when it curls up to sleep in cold weather.
7.33.401	Mammals have a residual effect from shivering and increased muscle activity: arrector pili muscles cause “goose bumps,” causing small hairs to stand up when the individual is cold; this has the intended effect of increasing body temperature.
7.33.402	Mammals use layers of fat to achieve the same end.
7.33.403	Loss of significant amounts of body fat will compromise an individual’s ability to conserve heat.
7.33.404	Endotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature.
7.33.405	Vasodilation brings more blood and heat to the body surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, which helps to cool the body.
7.33.406	Vasoconstriction reduces blood flow in peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and the vital organs found there, and conserving heat.
7.33.407	Some animals have adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins, warming blood returning to the heart.
7.33.408	This is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the heart and other internal organs.
7.33.409	This adaption can be shut down in some animals to prevent overheating the internal organs.
7.33.410	The countercurrent adaption is found in many animals, including dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds.
7.33.411	In contrast, similar adaptations can help cool endotherms when needed, such as dolphin flukes and elephant ears.
7.33.412	Some ectothermic animals use changes in their behavior to help regulate body temperature.
7.33.413	For example, a desert ectothermic animal may simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too warm.
7.33.414	The same animals may climb onto rocks to capture heat during a cold desert night.
7.33.415	Some animals seek water to aid evaporation in cooling them, as seen with reptiles.
7.33.416	Other ectotherms use group activity such as the activity of bees to warm a hive to survive winter.
7.33.417	Many animals, especially mammals, use metabolic waste heat as a heat source.
7.33.418	When muscles are contracted, most of the energy from the ATP used in muscle actions is wasted energy that translates into heat.
7.33.419	Severe cold elicits a shivering reflex that generates heat for the body.
7.33.420	Many species also have a type of adipose tissue called brown fat that specializes in generating heat.
7.33.421	Neural Control of Thermoregulation
7.33.422	The nervous system is important to thermoregulation, as illustrated in Figure 33.22.
7.33.423	The processes of homeostasis and temperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain.
7.33.424	The hypothalamus maintains the set point for body temperature through reflexes that cause vasodilation and sweating when the body is too warm, or vasoconstriction and shivering when the body is too cold.
7.33.425	It responds to chemicals from the body.
7.33.426	When a bacterium is destroyed by phagocytic leukocytes, chemicals called endogenous pyrogens are released into the blood.
7.33.427	These pyrogens circulate to the hypothalamus and reset the thermostat.
7.33.428	This allows the body’s temperature to increase in what is commonly called a fever.
7.33.429	An increase in body temperature causes iron to be conserved, which reduces a nutrient needed by bacteria.
7.33.430	An increase in body heat also increases the activity of the animal’s enzymes and protective cells while inhibiting the enzymes and activity of the invading microorganisms.
7.33.431	Finally, heat itself may also kill the pathogen.
7.33.432	A fever that was once thought to be a complication of an infection is now understood to be a normal defense mechanism.
7.34.0	For humans, fruits and vegetables are important in maintaining a balanced diet.
7.34.1	Introduction
7.34.2	All living organisms need nutrients to survive.
7.34.3	While plants can obtain the molecules required for cellular function through the process of photosynthesis, most animals obtain their nutrients by the consumption of other organisms.
7.34.4	At the cellular level, the biological molecules necessary for animal function are amino acids, lipid molecules, nucleotides, and simple sugars.
7.34.5	However, the food consumed consists of protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates.
7.34.6	Animals must convert these macromolecules into the simple molecules required for maintaining cellular functions, such as assembling new molecules, cells, and tissues.
7.34.7	The conversion of the food consumed to the nutrients required is a multi-step process involving digestion and absorption.
7.34.8	During digestion, food particles are broken down to smaller components, and later, they are absorbed by the body.
7.34.9	One of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake, storage, and energy expenditure.
7.34.10	Imbalances can have serious health consequences.
7.34.11	For example, eating too much food while not expending much energy leads to obesity, which in turn will increase the risk of developing illnesses such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
7.34.12	The recent rise in obesity and related diseases makes understanding the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health all the more important.
7.34.13	Animals obtain their nutrition from the consumption of other organisms.
7.34.14	Depending on their diet, animals can be classified into the following categories: plant eaters (herbivores), meat eaters (carnivores), and those that eat both plants and animals (omnivores).
7.34.15	The nutrients and macromolecules present in food are not immediately accessible to the cells.
7.34.16	There are a number of processes that modify food within the animal body in order to make the nutrients and organic molecules accessible for cellular function.
7.34.17	As animals evolved in complexity of form and function, their digestive systems have also evolved to accommodate their various dietary needs.
7.34.18	Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores Herbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant-based.
7.34.19	Examples of herbivores, as shown in Figure 34.2 include vertebrates like deer, koalas, and some bird species, as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars.
7.34.20	These animals have evolved digestive systems capable of handling large amounts of plant material.
7.34.21	Herbivores can be further classified into frugivores (fruit-eaters), granivores (seed eaters), nectivores (nectar feeders), and folivores (leaf eaters).
7.34.22	Herbivores, like this (a) mule deer and (b) monarch caterpillar, eat primarily plant material.
7.34.23	(credit a: modification of work by Bill Ebbesen; credit b: modification of work by Doug Bowman)
7.34.24	Carnivores are animals that eat other animals.
7.34.25	The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means “meat eater.
7.34.26	”
7.34.27	Wild cats such as lions, shown in Figure 34.3a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores, as are snakes and sharks, while invertebrate carnivores include sea stars, spiders, and ladybugs, shown in Figure 34.3b.
7.34.28	Obligate carnivores are those that rely entirely on animal flesh to obtain their nutrients; examples of obligate carnivores are members of the cat family, such as lions and cheetahs.
7.34.29	Facultative carnivores are those that also eat non-animal food in addition to animal food.
7.34.30	Note that there is no clear line that differentiates facultative carnivores from omnivores; dogs would be considered facultative carnivores.
7.34.31	Carnivores like the (a) lion eat primarily meat.
7.34.32	The (b) ladybug is also a carnivore that consumes small insects called aphids.
7.34.33	(credit a: modification of work by Kevin Pluck; credit b: modification of work by Jon Sullivan) Omnivores are animals that eat both plant- and animal-derived food.
7.34.34	In Latin, omnivore means to eat everything.
7.34.35	Humans, bears (shown in Figure 34.4a), and chickens are example of vertebrate omnivores; invertebrate omnivores include cockroaches and crayfish (shown in Figure 34.4b).
7.34.36	Omnivores like the (a) bear and (b) crayfish eat both plant and animal based food.
7.34.37	(credit a: modification of work by Dave Menke; credit b: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)
7.34.38	Invertebrate Digestive Systems Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume.
7.34.39	The simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion.
7.34.40	Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of digestion.
7.34.41	Gastrovascular cavities, as shown in Figure 34.5a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the “mouth”, which also serves as an “anus”.
7.34.42	Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity.
7.34.43	Cells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that break down the food.
7.34.44	The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the gastrovascular cavity.
7.34.45	The alimentary canal, shown in Figure 34.5b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other.
7.34.46	Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal.
7.34.47	Once the food is ingested through the mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is churned and digested.
7.34.48	From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.
7.34.49	A gastrovascular cavity has a single opening through which food is ingested and waste is excreted, as shown in this hydra and in this jellyfish medusa.
7.34.50	(b)
7.34.51	An alimentary canal has two openings: a mouth for ingesting food, and an anus for eliminating waste, as shown in this nematode.
7.34.52	Vertebrate Digestive Systems Vertebrates have evolved more complex digestive systems to adapt to their dietary needs.
7.34.53	Some animals have a single stomach, while others have multi-chambered stomachs.
7.34.54	Birds have developed a digestive system adapted to eating unmasticated food.
7.34.55	Monogastric:
7.34.56	Single-chambered Stomach
7.34.57	As the word monogastric suggests, this type of digestive system consists of one (“mono”) stomach chamber (“gastric”).
7.34.58	Humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in Figure 34.6ab.
7.34.59	The process of digestion begins with the mouth and the intake of food.
7.34.60	The teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically breaking down food into smaller particles.
7.34.61	The enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically break down food.
7.34.62	The esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.
7.34.63	Using peristalsis, or wave-like smooth muscle contractions, the muscles of the esophagus push the food towards the stomach.
7.34.64	In order to speed up the actions of enzymes in the stomach, the stomach is an extremely acidic environment, with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5.
7.34.65	The gastric juices, which include enzymes in the stomach, act on the food particles and continue the process of digestion.
7.34.66	Further breakdown of food takes place in the small intestine where enzymes produced by the liver, the small intestine, and the pancreas continue the process of digestion.
7.34.67	The nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream across the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestines.
7.34.68	The waste material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is stored until it is excreted through the rectum.
7.34.69	Humans and herbivores, such as the (b) rabbit, have a monogastric digestive system.
7.34.70	However, in the rabbit the small intestine and cecum are enlarged to allow more time to digest plant material.
7.34.71	The enlarged organ provides more surface area for absorption of nutrients.
7.34.72	Rabbits digest their food twice: the first time food passes through the digestive system, it collects in the cecum, and then it passes as soft feces called cecotrophes.
7.34.73	The rabbit re-ingests these cecotrophes to further digest them.
7.34.74	Avian Birds face special challenges when it comes to obtaining nutrition from food.
7.34.75	They do not have teeth and so their digestive system, shown in Figure 34.7, must be able to process un-masticated food.
7.34.76	Birds have evolved a variety of beak types that reflect the vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts.
7.34.77	Because most birds fly, their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low.
7.34.78	The stomach of birds has two chambers: the proventriculus, where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach, and the gizzard, where the food is stored, soaked, and mechanically ground.
7.34.79	The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated.
7.34.80	Most of the chemical digestion and absorption happens in the intestine and the waste is excreted through the cloaca.
7.34.81	The avian esophagus has a pouch, called a crop, which stores food.
7.34.82	Food passes from the crop to the first of two stomachs, called the proventriculus, which contains digestive juices that break down food.
7.34.83	From the proventriculus, the food enters the second stomach, called the gizzard, which grinds food.
7.34.84	Some birds swallow stones or grit, which are stored in the gizzard, to aid the grinding process.
7.34.85	Birds do not have separate openings to excrete urine and feces.
7.34.86	Instead, uric acid from the kidneys is secreted into the large intestine and combined with waste from the digestive process.
7.34.87	This waste is excreted through an opening called the cloaca.
7.34.88	Ruminants Ruminants are mainly herbivores like cows, sheep, and goats, whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of roughage or fiber.
7.34.89	They have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose.
7.34.90	An interesting feature of the ruminants’ mouth is that they do not have upper incisor teeth.
7.34.91	They use their lower teeth, tongue and lips to tear and chew their food.
7.34.92	From the mouth, the food travels to the esophagus and on to the stomach.
7.34.93	To help digest the large amount of plant material, the stomach of the ruminants is a multi-chambered organ, as illustrated in Figure 34.8.
7.34.94	The four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum.
7.34.95	These chambers contain many microbes that break down cellulose and ferment ingested food.
7.34.96	The abomasum is the “true” stomach and is the equivalent of the monogastric stomach chamber where gastric juices are secreted.
7.34.97	The four-compartment gastric chamber provides larger space and the microbial support necessary to digest plant material in ruminants.
7.34.98	The fermentation process produces large amounts of gas in the stomach chamber, which must be eliminated.
7.34.99	As in other animals, the small intestine plays an important role in nutrient absorption, and the large intestine helps in the elimination of waste.
7.34.100	Ruminant animals, such as goats and cows, have four stomachs.
7.34.101	The first two stomachs, the rumen and the reticulum, contain prokaryotes and protists that are able to digest cellulose fiber.
7.34.102	The ruminant regurgitates cud from the reticulum, chews it, and swallows it into a third stomach, the omasum, which removes water.
7.34.103	The cud then passes onto the fourth stomach, the abomasum, where it is digested by enzymes produced by the ruminant.
7.34.104	Pseudo-ruminants
7.34.105	Some animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants.
7.34.106	They eat a lot of plant material and roughage.
7.34.107	Digesting plant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose.
7.34.108	The digestive enzymes of these animals cannot break down cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can.
7.34.109	Therefore, the digestive system must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and break down the cellulose.
7.34.110	Pseudo-ruminants have a three- chamber stomach in the digestive system.
7.34.111	However, their cecum—a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing many microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials—is large and is the site where the roughage is fermented and digested.
7.34.112	These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum.
7.34.113	Parts of the Digestive System
7.34.114	The vertebrate digestive system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient components that sustain organisms.
7.34.115	Oral Cavity
7.34.116	The oral cavity, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated in Figure 34.9.
7.34.117	The food consumed is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth.
7.34.118	All mammals have teeth and can chew their food.
7.34.119	The extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth.
7.34.120	As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary glands, mixes with the food.
7.34.121	Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals.
7.34.122	There are three major glands that secrete saliva—the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual.
7.34.123	Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food.
7.34.124	Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes, which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria.
7.34.125	Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose.
7.34.126	Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue.
7.34.127	Lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides.
7.34.128	The lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat components in the food.
7.34.129	The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing.
7.34.130	The tongue helps in swallowing—moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx.
7.34.131	The pharynx opens to two passageways: the trachea, which leads to the lungs, and the esophagus, which leads to the stomach.
7.34.132	The trachea has an opening called the glottis, which is covered by a cartilaginous flap called the epiglottis.
7.34.133	When swallowing, the epiglottis closes the glottis and food passes into the esophagus and not the trachea.
7.34.134	This arrangement allows food to be kept out of the trachea.
7.34.135	Digestion of food begins in the (a) oral cavity.
7.34.136	Food is masticated by teeth and moistened by saliva secreted from the (b) salivary glands.
7.34.137	Enzymes in the saliva begin to digest starches and fats.
7.34.138	With the help of the tongue, the resulting bolus is moved into the esophagus by swallowing.
7.34.139	(credit: modification of work by the National Cancer Institute)
7.34.140	Esophagus
7.34.141	The esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach.
7.34.142	The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed.
7.34.143	The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called peristalsis that push the food toward the stomach, as illustrated in Figure 34.10.
7.34.144	The peristalsis wave is unidirectional—it moves food from the mouth to the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible.
7.34.145	The peristaltic movement of the esophagus is an involuntary reflex; it takes place in response to the act of swallowing.
7.34.146	The esophagus transfers food from the mouth to the stomach through peristaltic movements.
7.34.147	A ring-like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system.
7.34.148	The gastro-esophageal sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus.
7.34.149	In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens, and the bolus enters the stomach.
7.34.150	When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the stomach from traveling up the esophagus.
7.34.151	Many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true sphincter, but the esophagus remains closed when there is no swallowing action.
7.34.152	Acid reflux or “heartburn” occurs when the acidic digestive juices escape into the esophagus.
7.34.153	Stomach A large part of digestion occurs in the stomach, shown in Figure 34.11.
7.34.154	The stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric digestive juices.
7.34.155	The pH in the stomach is between 1.5 and 2.5.
7.34.156	This highly acidic environment is required for the chemical breakdown of food and the extraction of nutrients.
7.34.157	When empty, the stomach is a rather small organ; however, it can expand to up to 20 times its resting size when filled with food.
7.34.158	This characteristic is particularly useful for animals that need to eat when food is available.
7.34.159	The stomach is also the major site for protein digestion in animals other than ruminants.
7.34.160	Protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber.
7.34.161	Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called pepsinogen.
7.34.162	Pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides; it also helps activate more pepsinogen, starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin.
7.34.163	Another cell type—parietal cells—secrete hydrogen and chloride ions, which combine in the lumen to form hydrochloric acid, the primary acidic component of the stomach juices.
7.34.164	Hydrochloric acid helps to convert the inactive pepsinogen to pepsin.
7.34.165	The highly acidic environment also kills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the hydrolysis of protein in the food.
7.34.166	Chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach.
7.34.167	Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes.
7.34.168	The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme.
7.34.169	Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine.
7.34.170	Further protein digestion takes place in the small intestine.
7.34.171	Gastric emptying occurs within two to six hours after a meal.
7.34.172	Only a small amount of chyme is released into the small intestine at a time.
7.34.173	The movement of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine is regulated by the pyloric sphincter.
7.34.174	When digesting protein and some fats, the stomach lining must be protected from getting digested by pepsin.
7.34.175	There are two points to consider when describing how the stomach lining is protected.
7.34.176	First, as previously mentioned, the enzyme pepsin is synthesized in the inactive form.
7.34.177	This protects the chief cells, because pepsinogen does not have the same enzyme functionality of pepsin.
7.34.178	Second, the stomach has a thick mucus lining that protects the underlying tissue from the action of the digestive juices.
7.34.179	When this mucus lining is ruptured, ulcers can form in the stomach.
7.34.180	Ulcers are open wounds in or on an organ caused by bacteria (Helicobacter pylori) when the mucus lining is ruptured and fails to reform.
7.34.181	Small Intestine Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine.
7.34.182	The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates is completed.
7.34.183	The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger- like projections called the villi.
7.34.184	The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli.
7.34.185	These structures, illustrated in Figure 34.12, are lined with epithelial cells on the luminal side and allow for the nutrients to be absorbed from the digested food and absorbed into the blood stream on the other side.
7.34.186	The villi and microvilli, with their many folds, increase the surface area of the intestine and increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients.
7.34.187	Absorbed nutrients in the blood are carried into the hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver.
7.34.188	There, the liver regulates the distribution of nutrients to the rest of the body and removes toxic substances, including drugs, alcohol, and some pathogens.
7.34.189	The human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.
7.34.190	The “C-shaped,” fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in Figure 34.11.
7.34.191	The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum.
7.34.192	In the duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer.
7.34.193	Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes.
7.34.194	Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum.
7.34.195	Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder.
7.34.196	Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats.
7.34.197	These digestive juices break down the food particles in the chyme into glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids.
7.34.198	Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum.
7.34.199	Absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum.
7.34.200	The second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in Figure 34.11.
7.34.201	Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining.
7.34.202	The bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum.
7.34.203	The ileum, also illustrated in Figure 34.11 is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed into blood stream.
7.34.204	The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle.
7.34.205	The ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve.
7.34.206	The vermiform, “worm-like,” appendix is located at the ileocecal valve.
7.34.207	The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity.
7.34.208	Large Intestine
7.34.209	The large intestine, illustrated in Figure 34.13, reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste material.
7.34.210	The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter.
7.34.211	It has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum.
7.34.212	The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the waste matter.
7.34.213	The colon is home to many bacteria or “intestinal flora” that aid in the digestive processes.
7.34.214	The colon can be divided into four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon.
7.34.215	The main functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material.
7.34.216	Carnivorous mammals have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet.
7.34.217	The large intestine reabsorbs water from undigested food and stores waste material until it is eliminated.
7.34.218	Rectum and Anus
7.34.219	The rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine, as shown in Figure 34.13.
7.34.220	The primary role of the rectum is to store the feces until defecation.
7.34.221	The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination.
7.34.222	The anus is an opening at the far-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material.
7.34.223	Two sphincters between the rectum and anus control elimination: the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary.
7.34.224	Accessory Organs
7.34.225	The organs discussed above are the organs of the digestive tract through which food passes.
7.34.226	Accessory organs are organs that add secretions (enzymes) that catabolize food into nutrients.
7.34.227	Accessory organs include salivary glands, the liver, the pancreas, and the gallbladder.
7.34.228	The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are regulated by hormones in response to the food consumed.
7.34.229	The liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood.
7.34.230	The liver produces bile, a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components of the food in the duodenum.
7.34.231	The liver also processes the vitamins and fats and synthesizes many plasma proteins.
7.34.232	The pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices.
7.34.233	The chyme produced from the stomach is highly acidic in nature; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate, an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme.
7.34.234	Additionally, the pancreatic juices contain a large variety of enzymes that are required for the digestion of protein and carbohydrates.
7.34.235	The gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts.
7.34.236	When chyme containing fatty acids enters the duodenum, the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum.
7.34.237	Given the diversity of animal life on our planet, it is not surprising that the animal diet would also vary substantially.
7.34.238	The animal diet is the source of materials needed for building DNA and other complex molecules needed for growth, maintenance, and reproduction; collectively these processes are called biosynthesis.
7.34.239	The diet is also the source of materials for ATP production in the cells.
7.34.240	The diet must be balanced to provide the minerals and vitamins that are required for cellular function.
7.34.241	Food Requirements
7.34.242	What are the fundamental requirements of the animal diet?
7.34.243	The animal diet should be well balanced and provide nutrients required for bodily function and the minerals and vitamins required for maintaining structure and regulation necessary for good health and reproductive capability.
7.34.244	These requirements for a human are illustrated graphically in Figure 34.14.
7.34.245	Organic Precursors
7.34.246	The organic molecules required for building cellular material and tissues must come from food.
7.34.247	Carbohydrates or sugars are the primary source of organic carbons in the animal body.
7.34.248	During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down into glucose and used to provide energy through metabolic pathways.
7.34.249	Complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be broken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce the enzyme cellulase and lack the ability to derive glucose from the polysaccharide cellulose.
7.34.250	In humans, these molecules provide the fiber required for moving waste through the large intestine and a healthy colon.
7.34.251	The intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition from these plant fibers.
7.34.252	The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles for later use.
7.34.253	Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy during food shortage.
7.34.254	Excess glycogen can be converted to fats, which are stored in the lower layer of the skin of mammals for insulation and energy storage.
7.34.255	Excess digestible carbohydrates are stored by mammals in order to survive famine and aid in mobility.
7.34.256	Another important requirement is that of nitrogen.
7.34.257	Protein catabolism provides a source of organic nitrogen.
7.34.258	Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and protein breakdown provides amino acids that are used for cellular function.
7.34.259	The carbon and nitrogen derived from these become the building block for nucleotides, nucleic acids, proteins, cells, and tissues.
7.34.260	Excess nitrogen must be excreted as it is toxic.
7.34.261	Fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness.
7.34.262	Fatty foods are also significant sources of energy because one gram of fat contains nine calories.
7.34.263	Fats are required in the diet to aid the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.
7.34.264	Essential Nutrients
7.34.265	While the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors, there are some nutrients that need to be consumed from food.
7.34.266	These nutrients are termed essential nutrients, meaning they must be eaten, and the body cannot produce them.
7.34.267	The omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids.
7.34.268	Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes to function and, for this reason, are considered to be co-enzymes.
7.34.269	Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health, as outlined in Table 34.1 and Table 34.2.
7.34.270	Both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins must be obtained from food.
7.34.271	Minerals, listed in Table 34.3, are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food.
7.34.272	Among their many functions, minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered co-factors.
7.34.273	Certain amino acids also must be procured from food and cannot be synthesized by the body.
7.34.274	These amino acids are the “essential” amino acids.
7.34.275	The human body can synthesize only 11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food.
7.34.276	The essential amino acids are listed in Table 34.4.
7.34.277	Food Energy and ATP Animals need food to obtain energy and maintain homeostasis.
7.34.278	Homeostasis is the ability of a system to maintain a stable internal environment even in the face of external changes to the environment.
7.34.279	For example, the normal body temperature of humans is 37°C (98.6°F).
7.34.280	Humans maintain this temperature even when the external temperature is hot or cold.
7.34.281	It takes energy to maintain this body temperature, and animals obtain this energy from food.
7.34.282	The primary source of energy for animals is carbohydrates, mainly glucose.
7.34.283	Glucose is called the body’s fuel.
7.34.284	The digestible carbohydrates in an animal’s diet are converted to glucose molecules through a series of catabolic chemical reactions.
7.34.285	Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is the primary energy currency in cells; ATP stores energy in phosphate ester bonds.
7.34.286	ATP releases energy when the phosphodiester bonds are broken and ATP is converted to ADP and a phosphate group.
7.34.287	ATP is produced by the oxidative reactions in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion of the cell, where carbohydrates, proteins, and fats undergo a series of metabolic reactions collectively called cellular respiration.
7.34.288	For example, glycolysis is a series of reactions in which glucose is converted to pyruvic acid and some of its chemical potential energy is transferred to NADH and ATP.
7.34.289	ATP is required for all cellular functions.
7.34.290	It is used to build the organic molecules that are required for cells and tissues; it provides energy for muscle contraction and for the transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system.
7.34.291	When the amount of ATP is available in excess of the body’s requirements, the liver uses the excess ATP and excess glucose to produce molecules called glycogen.
7.34.292	Glycogen is a polymeric form of glucose and is stored in the liver and skeletal muscle cells.
7.34.293	When blood sugar drops, the liver releases glucose from stores of glycogen.
7.34.294	Skeletal muscle converts glycogen to glucose during intense exercise.
7.34.295	The process of converting glucose and excess ATP to glycogen and the storage of excess energy is an evolutionarily important step in helping animals deal with mobility, food shortages, and famine.
7.34.296	Obtaining nutrition and energy from food is a multi-step process.
7.34.297	For true animals, the first step is ingestion, the act of taking in food.
7.34.298	This is followed by digestion, absorption, and elimination.
7.34.299	In the following sections, each of these steps will be discussed in detail.
7.34.300	Ingestion
7.34.301	The large molecules found in intact food cannot pass through the cell membranes.
7.34.302	Food needs to be broken into smaller particles so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules.
7.34.303	The first step in this process is ingestion.
7.34.304	Ingestion is the process of taking in food through the mouth.
7.34.305	In vertebrates, the teeth, saliva, and tongue play important roles in mastication (preparing the food into bolus).
7.34.306	While the food is being mechanically broken down, the enzymes in saliva begin to chemically process the food as well.
7.34.307	The combined action of these processes modifies the food from large particles to a soft mass that can be swallowed and can travel the length of the esophagus.
7.34.308	Digestion and Absorption Digestion is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments.
7.34.309	It is important to break down macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium.
7.34.310	Large, complex molecules of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids must be reduced to simpler particles such as simple sugar before they can be absorbed by the digestive epithelial cells.
7.34.311	Different organs play specific roles in the digestive process.
7.34.312	The animal diet needs carbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins and inorganic components for nutritional balance.
7.34.313	How each of these components is digested is discussed in the following sections.
7.34.314	Carbohydrates The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth.
7.34.315	The salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of food starches into maltose, a disaccharide.
7.34.316	As the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach, no significant digestion of carbohydrates takes place.
7.34.317	The esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does produce mucous for lubrication.
7.34.318	The acidic environment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme.
7.34.319	The next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum.
7.34.320	Recall that the chyme from the stomach enters the duodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.
7.34.321	Pancreatic juices also contain amylase, which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose, a disaccharide.
7.34.322	The disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases, sucrases, and lactases, which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall.
7.34.323	Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose.
7.34.324	Other disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose are broken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively.
7.34.325	Sucrase breaks down sucrose (or “table sugar”) into glucose and fructose, and lactase breaks down lactose (or “milk sugar”) into glucose and galactose.
7.34.326	The monosaccharides (glucose) thus produced are absorbed and then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy.
7.34.327	The monosaccharides are transported across the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the body.
7.34.328	The steps in carbohydrate digestion are summarized in Figure 34.16 and Table 34.5.
7.34.329	Digestion of carbohydrates is performed by several enzymes.
7.34.330	Starch and glycogen are broken down into glucose by amylase and maltase.
7.34.331	Sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar) are broken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively.
7.34.332	Protein
7.34.333	A large part of protein digestion takes place in the stomach.
7.34.334	The enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion of proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides, which are short chains of four to nine amino acids.
7.34.335	In the duodenum, other enzymes— trypsin, elastase, and chymotrypsin—act on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides.
7.34.336	Trypsin elastase, carboxypeptidase, and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where they act on the chyme.
7.34.337	Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases (those that break down peptides).
7.34.338	Specifically, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, and aminopeptidase play important roles in reducing the peptides to free amino acids.
7.34.339	The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines.
7.34.340	The steps in protein digestion are summarized in Figure 34.17 and Table 34.6.
7.34.341	Lipids Lipid digestion begins in the stomach with the aid of lingual lipase and gastric lipase.
7.34.342	However, the bulk of lipid digestion occurs in the small intestine due to pancreatic lipase.
7.34.343	When chyme enters the duodenum, the hormonal responses trigger the release of bile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder.
7.34.344	Bile aids in the digestion of lipids, primarily triglycerides by emulsification.
7.34.345	Emulsification is a process in which large lipid globules are broken down into several small lipid globules.
7.34.346	These small globules are more widely distributed in the chyme rather than forming large aggregates.
7.34.347	Lipids are hydrophobic substances: in the presence of water, they will aggregate to form globules to minimize exposure to water.
7.34.348	Bile contains bile salts, which are amphipathic, meaning they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts.
7.34.349	Thus, the bile salts hydrophilic side can interface with water on one side and the hydrophobic side interfaces with lipids on the other.
7.34.350	By doing so, bile salts emulsify large lipid globules into small lipid globules.
7.34.351	Why is emulsification important for digestion of lipids?
7.34.352	Pancreatic juices contain enzymes called lipases (enzymes that break down lipids).
7.34.353	If the lipid in the chyme aggregates into large globules, very little surface area of the lipids is available for the lipases to act on, leaving lipid digestion incomplete.
7.34.354	By forming an emulsion, bile salts increase the available surface area of the lipids many fold.
7.34.355	The pancreatic lipases can then act on the lipids more efficiently and digest them, as detailed in Figure 34.18.
7.34.356	Lipases break down the lipids into fatty acids and glycerides.
7.34.357	These molecules can pass through the plasma membrane of the cell and enter the epithelial cells of the intestinal lining.
7.34.358	The bile salts surround long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides forming tiny spheres called micelles.
7.34.359	The micelles move into the brush border of the small intestine absorptive cells where the long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse out of the micelles into the absorptive cells leaving the micelles behind in the chyme.
7.34.360	The long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides, which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins.
7.34.361	These large spheres are called chylomicrons.
7.34.362	Chylomicrons contain triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids and have proteins on their surface.
7.34.363	The surface is also composed of the hydrophilic phosphate "heads" of phospholipids.
7.34.364	Together, they enable the chylomicron to move in an aqueous environment without exposing the lipids to water.
7.34.365	Chylomicrons leave the absorptive cells via exocytosis.
7.34.366	Chylomicrons enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the blood in the subclavian vein.
7.34.367	Vitamins Vitamins can be either water-soluble or lipid-soluble.
7.34.368	Fat soluble vitamins are absorbed in the same manner as lipids.
7.34.369	It is important to consume some amount of dietary lipid to aid the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins.
7.34.370	Water-soluble vitamins can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream from the intestine.
7.34.371	Elimination
7.34.372	The final step in digestion is the elimination of undigested food content and waste products.
7.34.373	The undigested food material enters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed.
7.34.374	Recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called “intestinal flora” that aid in the digestion process.
7.34.375	The semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the muscle and is stored in the rectum.
7.34.376	As the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals required to set up the urge to eliminate.
7.34.377	The solid waste is eliminated through the anus using peristaltic movements of the rectum.
7.34.378	Common Problems with Elimination Diarrhea and constipation are some of the most common health concerns that affect digestion.
7.34.379	Constipation is a condition where the feces are hardened because of excess water removal in the colon.
7.34.380	In contrast, if enough water is not removed from the feces, it results in diarrhea.
7.34.381	Many bacteria, including the ones that cause cholera, affect the proteins involved in water reabsorption in the colon and result in excessive diarrhea.
7.34.382	Emesis Emesis, or vomiting, is elimination of food by forceful expulsion through the mouth.
7.34.383	It is often in response to an irritant that affects the digestive tract, including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, emotions, sights, and food poisoning.
7.34.384	This forceful expulsion of the food is due to the strong contractions produced by the stomach muscles.
7.34.385	The process of emesis is regulated by the medulla.
7.34.386	The brain is the control center for the sensation of hunger and satiety.
7.34.387	The functions of the digestive system are regulated through neural and hormonal responses.
7.34.388	Neural Responses to Food
7.34.389	In reaction to the smell, sight, or thought of food, like that shown in Figure 34.20, the first response is that of salivation.
7.34.390	The salivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system triggered by food in preparation for digestion.
7.34.391	Simultaneously, the stomach begins to produce hydrochloric acid to digest the food.
7.34.392	Recall that the peristaltic movements of the esophagus and other organs of the digestive tract are under the control of the brain.
7.34.393	The brain prepares these muscles for movement as well.
7.34.394	When the stomach is full, the part of the brain that detects satiety signals fullness.
7.34.395	There are three overlapping phases of gastric control—the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase—each requires many enzymes and is under neural control as well.
7.34.396	Seeing a plate of food triggers the secretion of saliva in the mouth and the production of HCL in the stomach.
7.34.397	(credit: Kelly Bailey)
7.34.398	Digestive Phases
7.34.399	The response to food begins even before food enters the mouth.
7.34.400	The first phase of ingestion, called the cephalic phase, is controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food.
7.34.401	All aspects—such as sight, sense, and smell—trigger the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices.
7.34.402	The gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic phase can also take place due to the thought of food.
7.34.403	Right now, if you think about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato chip, the increase in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the thought.
7.34.404	The central nervous system prepares the stomach to receive food.
7.34.405	The gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach.
7.34.406	It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase.
7.34.407	Gastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials.
7.34.408	The gastric phase is stimulated by (1) distension of the stomach, (2) a decrease in the pH of the gastric contents, and (3) the presence of undigested material.
7.34.409	This phase consists of local, hormonal, and neural responses.
7.34.410	These responses stimulate secretions and powerful contractions.
7.34.411	The intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions.
7.34.412	This phase controls the rate of gastric emptying.
7.34.413	In addition to gastrin emptying, when chyme enters the small intestine, it triggers other hormonal and neural events that coordinate the activities of the intestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.
7.34.414	Hormonal Responses to Food
7.34.415	The endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate times.
7.34.416	One of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment.
7.34.417	During the gastric phase, the hormone gastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins.
7.34.418	Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid, or hydrochloric acid (HCl) which aids in the digestion of the proteins.
7.34.419	However, when the stomach is emptied, the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid.
7.34.420	This is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism.
7.34.421	In the duodenum, digestive secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme during the intestinal phase.
7.34.422	In order to neutralize the acidic chyme, a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum.
7.34.423	Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK).
7.34.424	Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices, it also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum.
7.34.425	Another level of hormonal control occurs in response to the composition of food.
7.34.426	Foods high in lipids take a long time to digest.
7.34.427	A hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed.
7.34.428	Understanding the hormonal control of the digestive system is an important area of ongoing research.
7.34.429	Scientists are exploring the role of each hormone in the digestive process and developing ways to target these hormones.
7.34.430	Advances could lead to knowledge that may help to battle the obesity epidemic.
7.35.0	An athlete’s nervous system is hard at work during the planning and execution of a movement as precise as a high jump.
7.35.1	Parts of the nervous system are involved in determining how hard to push off and when to turn, as well as controlling the muscles throughout the body that make this complicated movement possible without knocking the bar down—all in just a few seconds.

7.35.3	Introduction
7.35.4	When you’re reading this book, your nervous system is performing several functions simultaneously.
7.35.5	The visual system is processing what is seen on the page; the motor system controls the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains attention.
7.35.6	Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous system.
7.35.7	A nervous system is an organism’s control center: it processes sensory information from outside (and inside) the body and controls all behaviors—from eating to sleeping to finding a mate.
7.35.8	Nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity, as illustrated by the variety of animals shown in Figure 35.2.
7.35.9	Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system.
7.35.10	Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net.
7.35.11	”
7.35.12	Echinoderms such as sea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers called nerves.
7.35.13	Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a small “brain” and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body.
7.35.14	The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized.
7.35.15	It contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia (clusters of connected neurons).
7.35.16	These ganglia can control movements and behaviors without input from the brain.
7.35.17	Octopi may have the most complicated of invertebrate nervous systems
7.35.18	—they have neurons that are organized in specialized lobes and eyes that are structurally similar to vertebrate species.
7.35.19	Nervous systems vary in structure and complexity.
7.35.20	In (a) cnidarians, nerve cells form a decentralized nerve net.
7.35.21	In (b) echinoderms, nerve cells are bundled into fibers called nerves.
7.35.22	In animals exhibiting bilateral symmetry such as (c) planarians, neurons cluster into an anterior brain that processes information.
7.35.23	In addition to a brain, (d) arthropods have clusters of nerve cell bodies, called peripheral ganglia, located along the ventral nerve cord.
7.35.24	Mollusks such as squid and (e) octopi, which must hunt to survive, have complex brains containing millions of neurons.
7.35.25	In (f) vertebrates, the brain and spinal cord comprise the central nervous system, while neurons extending into the rest of the body comprise the peripheral nervous system.
7.35.26	(credit e: modification of work by Michael Vecchione, Clyde F.E. Roper, and Michael J. Sweeney, NOAA; credit f: modification of work by NIH).
7.35.27	Compared to invertebrates, vertebrate nervous systems are more complex, centralized, and specialized.
7.35.28	While there is great diversity among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic structure: a CNS that contains a brain and spinal cord and a PNS made up of peripheral sensory and motor nerves.
7.35.29	One interesting difference between the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords of many invertebrates are located ventrally whereas the vertebrate spinal cords are located dorsally.
7.35.30	There is debate among evolutionary biologists as to whether these different nervous system plans evolved separately or whether the invertebrate body plan arrangement somehow “flipped” during the evolution of vertebrates.
7.35.31	The nervous system is made up of neurons, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and glia, cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons.
7.35.32	A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire
7.35.33	—it transmits a signal from one place to another.
7.35.34	Glia can be compared to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to the right places, maintain the wires, and take down wires that are broken.
7.35.35	Although glia have been compared to workers, recent evidence suggests that also usurp some of the signaling functions of neurons.
7.35.36	There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system.
7.35.37	There are four major types of neurons, and they share several important cellular components.
7.35.38	Neurons
7.35.39	The nervous system of the common laboratory fly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same number as a lobster.
7.35.40	This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus.
7.35.41	A human brain contains around 86 billion neurons.
7.35.42	Despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same behaviors—from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates.
7.35.43	The ability of neurons to communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.
7.35.44	Most neurons share the same cellular components.
7.35.45	But neurons are also highly specialized—different types of neurons have different sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.
7.35.46	Parts of a Neuron
7.35.47	Like other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components.
7.35.48	Neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated in Figure 35.3 for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible.
7.35.49	Dendrites are tree-like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses.
7.35.50	Although some neurons do not have any dendrites, some types of neurons have multiple dendrites.
7.35.51	Dendrites can have small protrusions called dendritic spines, which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections.
7.35.52	Once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body.
7.35.53	The cell body contains a specialized structure, the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon.
7.35.54	An axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals.
7.35.55	These terminals in turn synapse on other neurons, muscle, or target organs.
7.35.56	Chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells.
7.35.57	Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine cells in the retina, do not contain any axons.
7.35.58	Some axons are covered with myelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction.
7.35.59	This insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter—from the base of the spine to the toes.
7.35.60	The myelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron.
7.35.61	Myelin is produced by glial cells.
7.35.62	Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath.
7.35.63	These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is
7.35.64	“recharged” as it travels along the axon.
7.35.65	It is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone
7.35.66	—neuronal communication depends on the connections that neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells).
7.35.67	Dendrites from a single neuron may receive synaptic contact from many other neurons.
7.35.68	For example, dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.
7.35.69	Types of Neurons There are different types of neurons, and the functional role of a given neuron is intimately dependent on its structure.
7.35.70	There is an amazing diversity of neuron shapes and sizes found in different parts of the nervous system (and across species), as illustrated by the neurons shown in Figure 35.4.
7.35.71	There is great diversity in the size and shape of neurons throughout the nervous system.
7.35.72	Examples include (a) a pyramidal cell from the cerebral cortex, (b) a Purkinje cell from the cerebellar cortex, and (c) olfactory cells from the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb.
7.35.73	While there are many defined neuron cell subtypes, neurons are broadly divided into four basic types: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar.
7.35.74	Figure 35.5 illustrates these four basic neuron types.
7.35.75	Unipolar neurons have only one structure that extends away from the soma.
7.35.76	These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands.
7.35.77	A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma.
7.35.78	An example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain.
7.35.79	Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron.
7.35.80	Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites.
7.35.81	Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).
7.35.82	An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but only one axon.
7.35.83	Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells.
7.35.84	A pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell.
7.35.85	Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions: one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord.
7.35.86	Neurons are broadly divided into four main types based on the number and placement of axons: (1) unipolar, (2) bipolar, (3) multipolar, and (4) pseudounipolar.
7.35.87	Glia
7.35.88	While glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the nervous system, the number of glial cells in the brain actually outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten.
7.35.89	Neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that are fulfilled by these glial cells.
7.35.90	Glia guide developing neurons to their destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would otherwise harm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons.
7.35.91	Scientists have recently discovered that they also play a role in responding to nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells.
7.35.92	When glia do not function properly, the result can be disastrous—most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia.
7.35.93	Types of Glia There are several different types of glia with different functions, two of which are shown in Figure 35.7.
7.35.94	Astrocytes, shown in Figure 35.8a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS.
7.35.95	They provide nutrients and other substances to neurons, regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid, and provide structural support for synapses.
7.35.96	Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier—a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain.
7.35.97	Astrocytes, in particular, have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity, transmit calcium waves between astrocytes, and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses.
7.35.98	Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS.
7.35.99	Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms.
7.35.100	Oligodendrocytes, shown in Figure 35.8b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS.
7.35.101	One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes, and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons.
7.35.102	This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon.
7.35.103	Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations.
7.35.104	Ependymal cells line fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord.
7.35.105	They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which serves as a cushion for the brain, moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain, and is a component for the choroid plexus.
7.35.106	Glial cells support neurons and maintain their environment.
7.35.107	Glial cells of the (a) central nervous system include oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ependymal cells, and microglial cells.
7.35.108	Oligodendrocytes form the myelin sheath around axons.
7.35.109	Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, maintain their extracellular environment, and provide structural support.
7.35.110	Microglia scavenge pathogens and dead cells.
7.35.111	Ependymal cells produce cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the neurons.
7.35.112	Glial cells of the (b) peripheral nervous system include Schwann cells, which form the myelin sheath, and satellite cells, which provide nutrients and structural support to neurons.
7.35.113	Astrocytes and (b) oligodendrocytes are glial cells of the central nervous system.
7.35.114	(credit a: modification of work by Uniformed Services University; credit b: modification of work by Jurjen Broeke; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.35.115	All functions performed by the nervous system—from a simple motor reflex to more advanced functions like making a memory or a decision—require neurons to communicate with one another.
7.35.116	While humans use words and body language to communicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals.
7.35.117	Just like a person in a committee, one neuron usually receives and synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before “making the decision” to send the message on to other neurons.
7.35.118	Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron
7.35.119	For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals.
7.35.120	These signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli.
7.35.121	To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge.
7.35.122	Neuronal Charged Membranes
7.35.123	The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions.
7.35.124	To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane.
7.35.125	Ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 35.9.
7.35.126	Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell.
7.35.127	These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly.
7.35.128	Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels.
7.35.129	Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell.
7.35.130	The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential.
7.35.131	Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to changes in membrane voltage.
7.35.132	After activation, they become inactivated for a brief period and will no longer open in response to a signal.
7.35.133	Resting Membrane Potential
7.35.134	A neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside (−70 mV, note that this number varies by neuron type and by species).
7.35.135	This voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell.
7.35.136	If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions, each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium.
7.35.137	Because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown in Table 35.1.
7.35.138	The difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions (K+) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane potential (Figure 35.10).
7.35.139	When the membrane is at rest, K+ ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the concentration gradient.
7.35.140	The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of cations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm).
7.35.141	The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement.
7.35.142	In neurons, potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell.
7.35.143	The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient.
7.35.144	However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels.
7.35.145	Therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in.
7.35.146	Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell.
7.35.147	The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential, once established.
7.35.148	Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two K+ ions into the cell while removing three Na+ ions per ATP consumed.
7.35.149	As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular fluid.
7.35.150	It should be noted that calcium ions (Cl–) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm.
7.35.151	he (a) resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations of Na+ and K+ ions inside and outside the cell.
7.35.152	A nerve impulse causes Na+ to enter the cell, resulting in (b) depolarization.
7.35.153	At the peak action potential, K+ channels open and the cell becomes
7.35.154	(c) hyperpolarized.
7.35.155	Action Potential
7.35.156	A neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons.
7.35.157	Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter.
7.35.158	Transmission of a signal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential.
7.35.159	When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron’s dendrites, ion channels open.
7.35.160	At excitatory synapses, this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane—a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron.
7.35.161	A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential (-55 mV).
7.35.162	Na+ channels in the axon hillock open, allowing positive ions to enter the cell (Figure 35.10 and Figure 35.11).
7.35.163	Once the sodium channels open, the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about +40 mV. Action potentials are considered an "all-or nothing" event, in that, once the threshold potential is reached, the neuron always completely depolarizes.
7.35.164	Once depolarization is complete, the cell must now "reset" its membrane voltage back to the resting potential.
7.35.165	To accomplish this, the Na+ channels close and cannot be opened.
7.35.166	This begins the neuron's refractory period, in which it cannot produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open.
7.35.167	At the same time, voltage-gated K+ channels open, allowing K+ to leave the cell.
7.35.168	As K+ ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes negative.
7.35.169	The diffusion of K+ out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell, in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell's normal resting potential.
7.35.170	At this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting state, meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential.
7.35.171	Eventually the extra K+ ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels, bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state, back to its resting membrane potential.
7.35.172	Myelin and the Propagation of the Action Potential
7.35.173	For an action potential to communicate information to another neuron, it must travel along the axon and reach the axon terminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release.
7.35.174	The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon’s resistance to current leak.
7.35.175	Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction.
7.35.176	In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas.
7.35.177	The nodes of Ranvier, illustrated in Figure 35.13 are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon.
7.35.178	These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and contain voltage gated Na+ and K+ channels.
7.35.179	Flow of ions through these channels, particularly the Na+ channels, regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon.
7.35.180	This ‘jumping’ of the action potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction.
7.35.181	If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon, the action potential would propagate very slowly since Na+ and K+ channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points.
7.35.182	Nodes of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron since the channels only need to be present at the nodes and not along the entire axon.
7.35.183	Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in myelin coverage along axons.
7.35.184	Nodes contain voltage-gated K+ and Na+ channels.
7.35.185	Action potentials travel down the axon by jumping from one node to the next.
7.35.186	Synaptic Transmission
7.35.187	The synapse or “gap” is the place where information is transmitted from one neuron to another.
7.35.188	Synapses usually form between axon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not universally true.
7.35.189	There are also axon-to-axon, dendrite-to- dendrite, and axon-to-cell body synapses.
7.35.190	The neuron transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the neuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron.
7.35.191	Note that these designations are relative to a particular synapse—most neurons are both presynaptic and postsynaptic.
7.35.192	There are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical.
7.35.193	Chemical Synapse
7.35.194	When an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-gated Na+ channels.
7.35.195	Na+ ions enter the cell, further depolarizing the presynaptic membrane.
7.35.196	This depolarization causes voltage-gated Ca2
7.35.197	+ channels to open.
7.35.198	Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane-bound vesicles, called synaptic vesicles, containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane.
7.35.199	Synaptic vesicles are shown in Figure 35.14, which is an image from a scanning electron microscope.
7.35.200	This pseudocolored image taken with a scanning electron microscope shows an axon terminal that was broken open to reveal synaptic vesicles (blue and orange) inside the neuron.
7.35.201	(credit: modification of work by Tina Carvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.35.202	Fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft, the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, as illustrated in Figure 35.15.
7.35.203	The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane.
7.35.204	Communication at chemical synapses requires release of neurotransmitters.
7.35.205	When the presynaptic membrane is depolarized, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open and allow Ca2+ to enter the cell.
7.35.206	The calcium entry causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft.
7.35.207	The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to ligand-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane, resulting in a localized depolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron.
7.35.208	The binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels, in this case ligand-gated channels, on the postsynaptic membrane to open.
7.35.209	Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic membrane, as detailed in Table 35.1.
7.35.210	For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and muscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na+ channels to open.
7.35.211	Na+ enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize.
7.35.212	This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential.
7.35.213	Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane.
7.35.214	For example, when the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released from a presynaptic neuron, it binds to and opens Cl- channels.
7.35.215	Cl- ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes the membrane, making the neuron less likely to fire an action potential.
7.35.216	Once neurotransmission has occurred, the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft so the postsynaptic membrane can “reset” and be ready to receive another signal.
7.35.217	This can be accomplished in three ways: the neurotransmitter can diffuse away from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled (sometimes called reuptake) by the presynaptic neuron.
7.35.218	Several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission.
7.35.219	For example, some drugs that are given to Alzheimer’s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine.
7.35.220	This inhibition of the enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine.
7.35.221	Once released, the acetylcholine stays in the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors.
7.35.222	Electrical Synapse CNS and/or PNS CNS and/or PNS CNS CNS and/or PNS        
7.35.223	While electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play important and unique roles.
7.35.224	The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical synapses.
7.35.225	In an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually physically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions.
7.35.226	Gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell to the next.
7.35.227	In addition to the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP, can diffuse through the large gap junction pores.
7.35.228	There are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses.
7.35.229	Because chemical synapses depend on the release of neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal, there is an approximately one millisecond delay between when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when the neurotransmitter leads to opening of postsynaptic ion channels.
7.35.230	Additionally, this signaling is unidirectional.
7.35.231	Signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast, is virtually instantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key reflexes), and some electrical synapses are bidirectional.
7.35.232	Electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked, and they are important for synchronizing the electrical activity of a group of neurons.
7.35.233	For example, electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slow-wave sleep, and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures.
7.35.234	Signal Summation
7.35.235	Sometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential.
7.35.236	This process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock, as illustrated in Figure 35.16.
7.35.237	Additionally, one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons—some excitatory and some inhibitory
7.35.238	—
7.35.239	so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa.
7.35.240	It is the net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential.
7.35.241	Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random “noise” in the system is not transmitted as important information.
7.35.242	A single neuron can receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from multiple neurons, resulting in local membrane depolarization (EPSP input) and hyperpolarization (IPSP input).
7.35.243	All these inputs are added together at the axon hillock.
7.35.244	If the EPSPs are strong enough to overcome the IPSPs and reach the threshold of excitation, the neuron will fire.
7.35.245	Synaptic Plasticity Synapses are not static structures.
7.35.246	They can be weakened or strengthened.
7.35.247	They can be broken, and new synapses can be made.
7.35.248	Synaptic plasticity allows for these changes, which are all needed for a functioning nervous system.
7.35.249	In fact, synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory.
7.35.250	Two processes in particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are important forms of synaptic plasticity that occur in synapses in the hippocampus, a brain region that is involved in storing memories.
7.35.251	Long-term Potentiation (LTP) Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection.
7.35.252	LTP is based on the Hebbian principle: cells that fire together wire together.
7.35.253	There are various mechanisms, none fully understood, behind the synaptic strengthening seen with LTP.
7.35.254	One known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic glutamate receptor, called NMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, shown in Figure 35.18.
7.35.255	These receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions; however, when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession (either from one neuron or multiple neurons), the magnesium ions are forced out allowing Ca ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell.
7.35.256	Next, Ca2+ ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor, called AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane, since activated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell.
7.35.257	So, the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane, it will have a larger excitatory effect (EPSP) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these AMPA receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell.
7.35.258	The insertion of additional AMPA receptors strengthens the synapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release.
7.35.259	Some drugs of abuse co-opt the LTP pathway, and this synaptic strengthening can lead to addiction.
7.35.260	Long-term Depression (LTD)
7.35.261	Long-term depression (LTD) is essentially the reverse of LTP: it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection.
7.35.262	One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors.
7.35.263	In this situation, calcium that enters through NMDA receptors initiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, as illustrated in Figure 35.18.
7.35.264	The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron.
7.35.265	While it may seem counterintuitive, LTD may be just as important for learning and memory as LTP.
7.35.266	The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes the synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison.
7.35.267	Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).
7.35.268	LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly stimulated.
7.35.269	This stimulation causes a calcium- and CaMKII-dependent cellular cascade, which results in the insertion of more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.
7.35.270	The next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell, it will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors, thus depolarizing the membrane more efficiently.
7.35.271	LTD occurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse (due to a low firing rate of the presynaptic neuron).
7.35.272	The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein phosphatase 1-dependent cascade, which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors.
7.35.273	This makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron.
7.35.274	The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of the brain, a part of which is shown in Figure 35.19 and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges (from the Greek word for membrane).
7.35.275	The outermost layer is the dura mater (Latin for “hard mother”).
7.35.276	As the Latin suggests, the primary function for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord.
7.35.277	The dura mater also contains vein-like structures that carry blood from the brain back to the heart.
7.35.278	The middle layer is the web-like arachnoid mater.
7.35.279	The last layer is the pia mater (Latin for “soft mother”), which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap.
7.35.280	The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
7.35.281	CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid-filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles.
7.35.282	The brain floats in CSF, which acts as a cushion and shock absorber and makes the brain neutrally buoyant.
7.35.283	CSF also functions to circulate chemical substances throughout the brain and into the spinal cord.
7.35.284	The entire brain contains only about 8.5 tablespoons of CSF, but CSF is constantly produced in the ventricles.
7.35.285	This creates a problem when a ventricle is blocked—
7.35.286	the CSF builds up and creates swelling and the brain is pushed against the skull.
7.35.287	This swelling condition is called hydrocephalus (“water head”) and can cause seizures, cognitive problems, and even death if a shunt is not inserted to remove the fluid and pressure.
7.35.288	The cerebral cortex is covered by three layers of meninges: the dura, arachnoid, and pia maters.
7.35.289	(credit: modification of work by Gray’s Anatomy) Brain
7.35.290	The brain is the part of the central nervous system that is contained in the cranial cavity of the skull.
7.35.291	It includes the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum.
7.35.292	There are three different ways that a brain can be sectioned in order to view internal structures: a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right, as shown in Figure 35.21b, a coronal section cuts the brain front to back, as shown in Figure 35.20a, and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom.
7.35.293	Cerebral Cortex
7.35.294	The outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex, which is folded into hills called gyri (singular: gyrus) and valleys called sulci (singular: sulcus).
7.35.295	The cortex is made up of two hemispheres
7.35.296	—right and left—which are separated by a large sulcus.
7.35.297	A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum (Latin: “tough body”) connects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other.
7.35.298	Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant.
7.35.299	In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy.
7.35.300	While patients do suffer some deficits following the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very immature nervous systems.
7.35.301	These illustrations show the (a) coronal and (b) sagittal sections of the human brain.
7.35.302	In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere.
7.35.303	This causes a condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres.
7.35.304	For example, when an object is presented to patients’ left visual field, they may be unable to verbally name the object (and may claim to not have seen an object at all).
7.35.305	This is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to the speech center, which generally is found in the left side of the brain.
7.35.306	Remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked to pick up a specific object out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still be unable to vocally identify it.
7.35.307	Each cortical hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions.
7.35.308	Scientists use various techniques to determine what brain areas are involved in different functions: they examine patients who have had injuries or diseases that affect specific areas and see how those areas are related to functional deficits.
7.35.309	They also conduct animal studies where they stimulate brain areas and see if there are any behavioral changes.
7.35.310	They use a technique called transmagnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily deactivate specific parts of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head; and they use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at changes in oxygenated blood flow in particular brain regions that correlate with specific behavioral tasks.
7.35.311	These techniques, and others, have given great insight into the functions of different brain regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one behavior or process, and any given behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas.
7.35.312	That being said, each hemisphere of the mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital.
7.35.313	Figure 35.21 illustrates these four lobes of the human cerebral cortex.
7.35.314	The human cerebral cortex includes the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.
7.35.315	The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain, over the eyes.
7.35.316	This lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which processes smells.
7.35.317	The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex, which is important for planning and implementing movement.
7.35.318	Areas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups, and there is some organization to this map, as shown in Figure 35.22.
7.35.319	For example, the neurons that control movement of the fingers are next to the neurons that control movement of the hand.
7.35.320	Neurons in the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention, speech, and decision- making.
7.35.321	Studies of humans who have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality, socialization, and assessing risk.
7.35.322	Different parts of the motor cortex control different muscle groups.
7.35.323	Muscle groups that are neighbors in the body are generally controlled by neighboring regions of the motor cortex as well.
7.35.324	For example, the neurons that control finger movement are near the neurons that control hand movement.
7.35.325	The parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain.
7.35.326	Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading.
7.35.327	Two of the parietal lobe’s main functions are processing somatosensation—touch sensations like pressure, pain, heat, cold—and processing proprioception—the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space.
7.35.328	The parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex.
7.35.329	The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain.
7.35.330	It is primarily involved in vision—seeing, recognizing, and identifying the visual world.
7.35.331	The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds.
7.35.332	It also contains the hippocampus (Greek for “seahorse”)—a structure that processes memory formation.
7.35.333	The hippocampus is illustrated in Figure 35.24.
7.35.334	The role of the hippocampus in memory was partially determined by studying one famous epileptic patient, HM, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy.
7.35.335	His seizures went away, but he could no longer form new memories (although he could remember some facts from before his surgery and could learn new motor tasks).
7.35.336	Basal Ganglia Interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia (or basal nuclei), shown in Figure 35.20b, play important roles in movement control and posture.
7.35.337	Damage to the basal ganglia, as in Parkinson’s disease, leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait when walking.
7.35.338	The basal ganglia also regulate motivation.
7.35.339	For example, when a wasp sting led to bilateral basal ganglia damage in a 25-year-old businessman, he began to spend all his days in bed and showed no interest in anything or anybody.
7.35.340	But when he was externally stimulated—as when someone asked to play a card game with him—he was able to function normally.
7.35.341	Interestingly, he and other similar patients do not report feeling bored or frustrated by their state.
7.35.342	Thalamus
7.35.343	The thalamus (Greek for “inner chamber”), illustrated in Figure 35.24, acts as a gateway to and from the cortex.
7.35.344	It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex.
7.35.345	This feedback mechanism can modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal.
7.35.346	The thalamus helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states.
7.35.347	A rare genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia causes the degeneration of thalamic neurons and glia.
7.35.348	This disorder prevents affected patients from being able to sleep, among other symptoms, and is eventually fatal.
7.35.349	The limbic system regulates emotion and other behaviors.
7.35.350	It includes parts of the cerebral cortex located near the center of the brain, including the cingulate gyrus and the hippocampus as well as the thalamus, hypothalamus and amygdala.
7.35.351	Hypothalamus
7.35.352	Below the thalamus is the hypothalamus, shown in Figure 35.24.
7.35.353	The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland, a pea-sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other glands as well as other cells.
7.35.354	This relationship means that the hypothalamus regulates important behaviors that are controlled by these hormones.
7.35.355	The hypothalamus is the body’s thermostat—it makes sure key functions like food and water intake, energy expenditure, and body temperature are kept at appropriate levels.
7.35.356	Neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.
7.35.357	Limbic System
7.35.358	The limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation.
7.35.359	It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus.
7.35.360	One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala (Greek for “almond”), illustrated in Figure 35.24.
7.35.361	The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces.
7.35.362	The cingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain.
7.35.363	Cerebellum
7.35.364	The cerebellum (Latin for “little brain”), shown in Figure 35.21, sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem.
7.35.365	The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks.
7.35.366	Brainstem
7.35.367	The brainstem, illustrated in Figure 35.21, connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord.
7.35.368	It consists of the midbrain, medulla oblongata, and the pons.
7.35.369	Motor and sensory neurons extend through the brainstem allowing for the relay of signals between the brain and spinal cord.
7.35.370	Ascending neural pathways cross in this section of the brain allowing the left hemisphere of the cerebrum to control the right side of the body and vice versa.
7.35.371	The brainstem coordinates motor control signals sent from the brain to the body.
7.35.372	The brainstem controls several important functions of the body including alertness, arousal, breathing, blood pressure, digestion, heart rate, swallowing, walking, and sensory and motor information integration.
7.35.373	Spinal Cord Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord, shown in Figure 35.21.
7.35.374	The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body.
7.35.375	The spinal cord is contained within the bones of the vertebrate column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral nervous system).
7.35.376	A cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape, as illustrated in Figure 35.25.
7.35.377	Myelinated axons make up the “white matter” and neuron and glial cell bodies make up the “gray matter.
7.35.378	”
7.35.379	Gray matter is also composed of interneurons, which connect two neurons each located in different parts of the body.
7.35.380	Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal (facing the back of the animal) spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain.
7.35.381	Axons and cell bodies in the ventral (facing the front of the animal) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body.
7.35.382	The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes.
7.35.383	These reflexes are quick, unconscious movements—like automatically removing a hand from a hot object.
7.35.384	Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections.
7.35.385	For example, the knee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron.
7.35.386	While a reflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).
7.35.387	In the United States, there around 10,000 spinal cord injuries each year.
7.35.388	Because the spinal cord is the information superhighway connecting the brain with the body, damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis.
7.35.389	The extent of the paralysis depends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal cord was completely severed.
7.35.390	For example, if the spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck, it can cause paralysis from the neck down, whereas damage to the spinal column further down may limit paralysis to the legs.
7.35.391	Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to treat because spinal nerves do not regenerate, although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to act as a bridge to reconnect severed nerves.
7.35.392	Researchers are also looking at ways to prevent the inflammation that worsens nerve damage after injury.
7.35.393	One such treatment is to pump the body with cold saline to induce hypothermia.
7.35.394	This cooling can prevent swelling and other processes that are thought to worsen spinal cord injuries.
7.35.395	The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the connection between the central nervous system and the rest of the body.
7.35.396	The CNS is like the power plant of the nervous system.
7.35.397	It creates the signals that control the functions of the body.
7.35.398	The PNS is like the wires that go to individual houses.
7.35.399	Without those “wires,” the signals produced by the CNS could not control the body (and the CNS would not be able to receive sensory information from the body either).
7.35.400	The PNS can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system, which controls bodily functions without conscious control, and the sensory-somatic nervous system, which transmits sensory information from the skin, muscles, and sensory organs to the CNS and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.
7.35.401	The autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the CNS and the internal organs.
7.35.402	It controls the lungs, the heart, smooth muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands.
7.35.403	The autonomic nervous system controls these organs largely without conscious control; it can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems and implement changes as needed.
7.35.404	Signaling to the target tissue usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating in the CNS) synapses to a neuron in a ganglion that, in turn, synapses on the target organ, as illustrated in Figure 35.26.
7.35.405	There are two divisions of the autonomic nervous system that often have opposing effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.
7.35.406	Sympathetic Nervous System
7.35.407	The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the “fight or flight” response that occurs when an animal encounters a dangerous situation.
7.35.408	One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake
7.35.409	(“snake” and “sympathetic” both begin with “s”).
7.35.410	Examples of functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion.
7.35.411	These functions help prepare an organism’s body for the physical strain required to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a predator.
7.35.412	The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems often have opposing effects on target organs.
7.35.413	Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord, as illustrated in Figure 35.27.
7.35.414	The axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia (the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord).
7.35.415	The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons.
7.35.416	Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs.
7.35.417	As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test, speech, or athletic event can attest, the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive.
7.35.418	This is both because one preganglionic neuron synapses on multiple postganglionic neurons, amplifying the effect of the original synapse, and because the adrenal gland also releases norepinephrine (and the closely related hormone epinephrine) into the blood stream.
7.35.419	The physiological effects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi (making it easier for the animal to breathe), increasing heart rate, and moving blood from the skin to the heart, muscles, and brain (so the animal can think and run).
7.35.420	The strength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid danger, and scientists have found evidence that it may also increase LTP—allowing the animal to remember the dangerous situation and avoid it in the future.
7.35.421	Parasympathetic Nervous System
7.35.422	While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations, the parasympathetic nervous system allows an animal to “rest and digest.
7.35.423	”
7.35.424	One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic, the parasympathetic nervous system is in control (“picnic” and
7.35.425	“parasympathetic” both start with “p”).
7.35.426	Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral (toward the bottom) spinal cord, as shown in Figure 35.27.
7.35.427	The axons of the preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine on the postganglionic neurons, which are generally located very near the target organs.
7.35.428	Most postganglionic neurons release acetylcholine onto target organs, although some release nitric oxide.
7.35.429	The parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated (the common adrenaline dump you feel after a ‘fight-or-flight’ event).
7.35.430	Effects of acetylcholine release on target organs include slowing of heart rate, lowered blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion.
7.35.431	Sensory-Somatic Nervous System
7.35.432	The sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons.
7.35.433	Sensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal muscle, and sensory organs to the CNS.
7.35.434	Motor neurons transmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to make them contract.
7.35.435	Without its sensory- somatic nervous system, an animal would be unable to process any information about its environment (what it sees, feels, hears, and so on) and could not control motor movements.
7.35.436	Unlike the autonomic nervous system, which has two synapses between the CNS and the target organ, sensory and motor neurons have only one synapse—one ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other directly contacts a CNS neuron.
7.35.437	Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter released at these synapses.
7.35.438	Humans have 12 cranial nerves, nerves that emerge from or enter the skull (cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves, which emerge from the vertebral column.
7.35.439	Each cranial nerve is accorded a name, which are detailed in Figure 35.28.
7.35.440	Some cranial nerves transmit only sensory information.
7.35.441	For example, the olfactory nerve transmits information about smells from the nose to the brainstem.
7.35.442	Other cranial nerves transmit almost solely motor information.
7.35.443	For example, the oculomotor nerve controls the opening and closing of the eyelid and some eye movements.
7.35.444	Other cranial nerves contain a mix of sensory and motor fibers.
7.35.445	For example, the glossopharyngeal nerve has a role in both taste (sensory) and swallowing (motor).
7.35.446	The human brain contains 12 cranial nerves that receive sensory input and control motor output for the head and neck.
7.35.447	Spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body.
7.35.448	Each of the 31 spinal nerves (in humans) contains both sensory and motor axons.
7.35.449	The sensory neuron cell bodies are grouped in structures called dorsal root ganglia and are shown in Figure 35.29.
7.35.450	Each sensory neuron has one projection—with a sensory receptor ending in skin, muscle, or sensory organs—and another that synapses with a neuron in the dorsal spinal cord.
7.35.451	Motor neurons have cell bodies in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord that project to muscle through the ventral root.
7.35.452	These neurons are usually stimulated by interneurons within the spinal cord but are sometimes directly stimulated by sensory neurons.
7.35.453	Spinal nerves contain both sensory and motor axons.
7.35.454	The somas of sensory neurons are located in dorsal root ganglia.
7.35.455	The somas of motor neurons are found in the ventral portion of the gray matter of the spinal cord.
7.35.456	A nervous system that functions correctly is a fantastically complex, well-oiled machine—synapses fire appropriately, muscles move when needed, memories are formed and stored, and emotions are well regulated.
7.35.457	Unfortunately, each year millions of people in the United States deal with some sort of nervous system disorder.
7.35.458	While scientists have discovered potential causes of many of these diseases, and viable treatments for some, ongoing research seeks to find ways to better prevent and treat all of these disorders.
7.35.459	Neurodegenerative Disorders Neurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused by neuronal death.
7.35.460	These diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die.
7.35.461	The symptoms of a particular neurodegenerative disease are related to where in the nervous system the death of neurons occurs.
7.35.462	Spinocerebellar ataxia, for example, leads to neuronal death in the cerebellum.
7.35.463	The death of these neurons causes problems in balance and walking.
7.35.464	Neurodegenerative disorders include Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia disorders, and Parkinson’s disease.
7.35.465	Here, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease will be discussed in more depth.
7.35.466	Alzheimer’s Disease Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly.
7.35.467	In 2012, an estimated 5.4 million Americans suffered from Alzheimer’s disease, and payments for their care are estimated at $200 billion.
7.35.468	Roughly one in every eight people age 65 or older has the disease.
7.35.469	Due to the aging of the baby-boomer generation, there are projected to be as many as 13 million Alzheimer’s patients in the United States in the year 2050.
7.35.470	Symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease include disruptive memory loss, confusion about time or place, difficulty planning or executing tasks, poor judgment, and personality changes.
7.35.471	Problems smelling certain scents can also be indicative of Alzheimer’s disease and may serve as an early warning sign.
7.35.472	Many of these symptoms are also common in people who are aging normally, so it is the severity and longevity of the symptoms that determine whether a person is suffering from Alzheimer’s.
7.35.473	Alzheimer’s disease was named for Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist who published a report in 1911 about a woman who showed severe dementia symptoms.
7.35.474	Along with his colleagues, he examined the woman’s brain following her death and reported the presence of abnormal clumps, which are now called amyloid plaques, along with tangled brain fibers called neurofibrillary tangles.
7.35.475	Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and an overall shrinking of brain volume are commonly seen in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.
7.35.476	Loss of neurons in the hippocampus is especially severe in advanced Alzheimer’s patients.
7.35.477	Figure 35.30 compares a normal brain to the brain of an Alzheimer’s patient.
7.35.478	Many research groups are examining the causes of these hallmarks of the disease.
7.35.479	One form of the disease is usually caused by mutations in one of three known genes.
7.35.480	This rare form of early onset Alzheimer’s disease affects fewer than five percent of patients with the disease and causes dementia beginning between the ages of 30 and 60.
7.35.481	The more prevalent, late-onset form of the disease likely also has a genetic component.
7.35.482	One particular gene, apolipoprotein E (APOE) has a variant (E4) that increases a carrier’s likelihood of getting the disease.
7.35.483	Many other genes have been identified that might be involved in the pathology.
7.35.484	Unfortunately, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease.
7.35.485	Current treatments focus on managing the symptoms of the disease.
7.35.486	Because decrease in the activity of cholinergic neurons (neurons that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) is common in Alzheimer’s disease, several drugs used to treat the disease work by increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission, often by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft.
7.35.487	Other clinical interventions focus on behavioral therapies like psychotherapy, sensory therapy, and cognitive exercises.
7.35.488	Since Alzheimer’s disease appears to hijack the normal aging process, research into prevention is prevalent.
7.35.489	Smoking, obesity, and cardiovascular problems may be risk factors for the disease, so treatments for those may also help to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.
7.35.490	Some studies have shown that people who remain intellectually active by playing games, reading, playing musical instruments, and being socially active in later life have a reduced risk of developing the disease.
7.35.491	Compared to a normal brain (left), the brain from a patient with Alzheimer’s disease (right) shows a dramatic neurodegeneration, particularly within the ventricles and hippocampus.

7.35.493	"Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center, a service of the National Institute on Aging”)
7.35.494	Parkinson’s Disease Like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease.
7.35.495	It was first characterized by James Parkinson in 1817.
7.35.496	Each year, 50,000-60,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease.
7.35.497	Parkinson’s disease causes the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, a midbrain structure that regulates movement.
7.35.498	Loss of these neurons causes many symptoms including tremor (shaking of fingers or a limb), slowed movement, speech changes, balance and posture problems, and rigid muscles.
7.35.499	The combination of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched shuffling walk, illustrated in Figure 35.31.
7.35.500	Patients with Parkinson’s disease can also exhibit psychological symptoms, such as dementia or emotional problems.
7.35.501	Although some patients have a form of the disease known to be caused by a single mutation, for most patients the exact causes of Parkinson’s disease remain unknown: the disease likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors (similar to Alzheimer’s disease).
7.35.502	Post-mortem analysis of brains from Parkinson’s patients shows the presence of Lewy bodies—abnormal protein clumps—in dopaminergic neurons.
7.35.503	The prevalence of these Lewy bodies often correlates with the severity of the disease.
7.35.504	There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, and treatment is focused on easing symptoms.
7.35.505	One of the most commonly prescribed drugs for Parkinson’s is L-DOPA, which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by neurons in the brain.
7.35.506	This conversion increases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.
7.35.507	Other drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine.
7.35.508	Parkinson’s patients often have a characteristic hunched walk.
7.35.509	Neurodevelopmental Disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders occur when the development of the nervous system is disturbed.
7.35.510	There are several different classes of neurodevelopmental disorders.
7.35.511	Some, like Down Syndrome, cause intellectual deficits.
7.35.512	Others specifically affect communication, learning, or the motor system.
7.35.513	Some disorders like autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder have complex symptoms.
7.35.514	Autism Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder.
7.35.515	Its severity differs from person to person.
7.35.516	Estimates for the prevalence of the disorder have changed rapidly in the past few decades.
7.35.517	Current estimates suggest that one in 88 children will develop the disorder.
7.35.518	ASD is four times more prevalent in males than females.
7.35.519	A characteristic symptom of ASD is impaired social skills.
7.35.520	Children with autism may have difficulty making and maintaining eye contact and reading social cues.
7.35.521	They also may have problems feeling empathy for others.
7.35.522	Other symptoms of ASD include repetitive motor behaviors (such as rocking back and forth), preoccupation with specific subjects, strict adherence to certain rituals, and unusual language use.
7.35.523	Up to 30 percent of patients with ASD develop epilepsy, and patients with some forms of the disorder (like Fragile X) also have intellectual disability.
7.35.524	Because it is a spectrum disorder, other ASD patients are very functional and have good-to-excellent language skills.
7.35.525	Many of these patients do not feel that they suffer from a disorder and instead think that their brains just process information differently.
7.35.526	Except for some well-characterized, clearly genetic forms of autism (like Fragile X and Rett’s Syndrome), the causes of ASD are largely unknown.
7.35.527	Variants of several genes correlate with the presence of ASD, but for any given patient, many different mutations in different genes may be required for the disease to develop.
7.35.528	At a general level, ASD is thought to be a disease of “incorrect” wiring.
7.35.529	Accordingly, brains of some ASD patients lack the same level of synaptic pruning that occurs in non-affected people.
7.35.530	In the 1990s, a research paper linked autism to a common vaccine given to children.
7.35.531	This paper was retracted when it was discovered that the author falsified data, and follow-up studies showed no connection between vaccines and autism.
7.35.532	Treatment for autism usually combines behavioral therapies and interventions, along with medications to treat other disorders common to people with autism (depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder).
7.35.533	Although early interventions can help mitigate the effects of the disease, there is currently no cure for ASD.
7.35.534	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
7.35.535	Approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
7.35.536	Like ASD, ADHD is more prevalent in males than females.
7.35.537	Symptoms of the disorder include inattention (lack of focus), executive functioning difficulties, impulsivity, and hyperactivity beyond what is characteristic of the normal developmental stage.
7.35.538	Some patients do not have the hyperactive component of symptoms and are diagnosed with a subtype of ADHD:
7.35.539	attention deficit disorder (ADD).
7.35.540	Many people with ADHD also show comorbitity, in that they develop secondary disorders in addition to ADHD.
7.35.541	Examples include depression or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
7.35.542	Figure 35.32 provides some statistics concerning comorbidity with ADHD.
7.35.543	The cause of ADHD is unknown, although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the prefrontal cortex and disturbances in neurotransmission.
7.35.544	According to studies of twins, the disorder has a strong genetic component.
7.35.545	There are several candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder, but no definitive links have been discovered.
7.35.546	Environmental factors, including exposure to certain pesticides, may also contribute to the development of ADHD in some patients.
7.35.547	Treatment for ADHD often involves behavioral therapies and the prescription of stimulant medications, which paradoxically cause a calming effect in these patients.
7.35.548	Many people with ADHD have one or more other neurological disorders.
7.35.549	(credit “chart design and illustration”:
7.35.550	modification of work by Leigh Coriale; credit “data”: Drs.
7.35.551	Biederman and Faraone, Massachusetts General Hospital).
7.35.552	Mental Illnesses Mental illnesses are nervous system disorders that result in problems with thinking, mood, or relating with other people.
7.35.553	These disorders are severe enough to affect a person’s quality of life and often make it difficult for people to perform the routine tasks of daily living.
7.35.554	Debilitating mental disorders plague approximately 12.5 million Americans (about 1 in 17 people) at an annual cost of more than $300 billion.
7.35.555	There are several types of mental disorders including schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders and phobias, post-traumatic stress disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), among others.
7.35.556	The American Psychiatric Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (or DSM), which describes the symptoms required for a patient to be diagnosed with a particular mental disorder.
7.35.557	Each newly released version of the DSM contains different symptoms and classifications as scientists learn more about these disorders, their causes, and how they relate to each other.
7.35.558	A more detailed discussion of two mental illnesses—schizophrenia and major depression—is given below.
7.35.559	Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United States.
7.35.560	Symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination, inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses, difficulty thinking, and problems with social situations.
7.35.561	People with schizophrenia can suffer from hallucinations and hear voices; they may also suffer from delusions.
7.35.562	Patients also have so-called “negative” symptoms like a flattened emotional state, loss of pleasure, and loss of basic drives.
7.35.563	Many schizophrenic patients are diagnosed in their late adolescence or early 20s.
7.35.564	The development of schizophrenia is thought to involve malfunctioning dopaminergic neurons and may also involve problems with glutamate signaling.
7.35.565	Treatment for the disease usually requires antipsychotic medications that work by blocking dopamine receptors and decreasing dopamine neurotransmission in the brain.
7.35.566	This decrease in dopamine can cause Parkinson’s disease-like symptoms in some patients.
7.35.567	While some classes of antipsychotics can be quite effective at treating the disease, they are not a cure, and most patients must remain medicated for the rest of their lives.
7.35.568	Depression Major depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most common mental disorders.
7.35.569	To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder, a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed, changes in appetite and sleep schedules, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts.
7.35.570	The exact causes of major depression are unknown and likely include both genetic and environmental risk factors.
7.35.571	Some research supports the “classic monoamine hypothesis,” which suggests that depression is caused by a decrease in norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission.
7.35.572	One argument against this hypothesis is the fact that some antidepressant medications cause an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin release within a few hours of beginning treatment—but clinical results of these medications are not seen until weeks later.
7.35.573	This has led to alternative hypotheses: for example, dopamine may also be decreased in depressed patients, or it may actually be an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin that causes the disease, and antidepressants force a feedback loop that decreases this release.
7.35.574	Treatments for depression include psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, deep-brain stimulation, and prescription medications.
7.35.575	There are several classes of antidepressant medications that work through different mechanisms.
7.35.576	For example, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) block the enzyme that degrades many neurotransmitters (including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine), resulting in increased neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft.
7.35.577	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron.
7.35.578	This blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the synaptic cleft.
7.35.579	Other types of drugs such as norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also used to treat depression.
7.35.580	Other Neurological Disorders There are several other neurological disorders that cannot be easily placed in the above categories.
7.35.581	These include chronic pain conditions, cancers of the nervous system, epilepsy disorders, and stroke.
7.35.582	Epilepsy and stroke are discussed below.
7.35.583	Epilepsy Estimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the United States will be diagnosed with epilepsy in their lifetime.
7.35.584	While there are several different types of epilepsy, all are characterized by recurrent seizures.
7.35.585	Epilepsy itself can be a symptom of a brain injury, disease, or other illness.
7.35.586	For example, people who have intellectual disability or ASD can experience seizures, presumably because the developmental wiring malfunctions that caused their disorders also put them at risk for epilepsy.
7.35.587	For many patients, however, the cause of their epilepsy is never identified and is likely to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
7.35.588	Often, seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medications.
7.35.589	However, for very severe cases, patients may undergo brain surgery to remove the brain area where seizures originate.
7.35.590	Stroke A stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage.
7.35.591	Without the oxygen supplied by blood flow, neurons in this brain region die.
7.35.592	This neuronal death can cause many different symptoms—depending on the brain area affected— including headache, muscle weakness or paralysis, speech disturbances, sensory problems, memory loss, and confusion.
7.35.593	Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel.
7.35.594	Strokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the United States.
7.35.595	On average one person experiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States.
7.35.596	Approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65.
7.35.597	Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a family history of stroke.
7.35.598	Smoking doubles the risk of stroke.
7.35.599	Because a stroke is a medical emergency, patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to the emergency room, where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed.
7.35.600	These drugs will not work if the stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the hospital.
7.35.601	Treatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication (to prevent future strokes) and (sometimes intense) physical therapy.
7.36.0	Introduction
7.36.1	In more advanced animals, the senses are constantly at work, making the animal aware of stimuli—such as light, or sound, or the presence of a chemical substance in the external environment—and monitoring information about the organism’s internal environment.
7.36.2	All bilaterally symmetric animals have a sensory system, and the development of any species’ sensory system has been driven by natural selection; thus, sensory systems differ among species according to the demands of their environments.
7.36.3	The shark, unlike most fish predators, is electrosensitive—that is, sensitive to electrical fields produced by other animals in its environment.
7.36.4	While it is helpful to this underwater predator, electrosensitivity is a sense not found in most land animals.
7.36.5	Senses provide information about the body and its environment.
7.36.6	Humans have five special senses: olfaction (smell), gustation (taste), equilibrium (balance and body position), vision, and hearing.
7.36.7	Additionally, we possess general senses, also called somatosensation, which respond to stimuli like temperature, pain, pressure, and vibration.
7.36.8	Vestibular sensation, which is an organism’s sense of spatial orientation and balance, proprioception (position of bones, joints, and muscles), and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia (limb movement) are part of somatosensation.
7.36.9	Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different, all share a common function: to convert a stimulus (such as light, or sound, or the position of the body) into an electrical signal in the nervous system.
7.36.10	This process is called sensory transduction.
7.36.11	There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction.
7.36.12	In one, a neuron works with a sensory receptor, a cell, or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus.
7.36.13	Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron, which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system.
7.36.14	In the second type of sensory transduction, a sensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment: this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor.
7.36.15	Free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different stimuli, thus showing little receptor specificity.
7.36.16	For example, pain receptors in your gums and teeth may be stimulated by temperature changes, chemical stimulation, or pressure.
7.36.17	Reception
7.36.18	The first step in sensation is reception, which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli (being bent or squished, for example), chemicals, or temperature.
7.36.19	The receptor can then respond to the stimuli.
7.36.20	The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus, be it far away or in contact with the body, is that receptor’s receptive field.
7.36.21	Think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses.
7.36.22	For the sense of touch, a stimulus must come into contact with body.
7.36.23	For the sense of hearing, a stimulus can be a moderate distance away (some baleen whale sounds can propagate for many kilometers).
7.36.24	For vision, a stimulus can be very far away; for example, the visual system perceives light from stars at enormous distances.
7.36.25	Transduction
7.36.26	The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system.
7.36.27	This takes place at the sensory receptor, and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the receptor potential.
7.36.28	How is sensory input, such as pressure on the skin, changed to a receptor potential?
7.36.29	In this example, a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor (as shown in Figure 36.2) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure.
7.36.30	Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron, changing its electrical potential.
7.36.31	Recall that in the nervous system, a positive change of a neuron’s electrical potential (also called the membrane potential), depolarizes the neuron.
7.36.32	Receptor potentials are graded potentials: the magnitude of these graded (receptor) potentials varies with the strength of the stimulus.
7.36.33	If the magnitude of depolarization is sufficient (that is, if membrane potential reaches a threshold), the neuron will fire an action potential.
7.36.34	In most cases, the correct stimulus impinging on a sensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a positive direction, although for some receptors, such as those in the visual system, this is not always the case.
7.36.35	Mechanosensitive ion channels are gated ion channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the plasma membrane.
7.36.36	A mechanosensitive channel is connected to the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton by hair- like tethers.
7.36.37	When pressure causes the extracellular matrix to move, the channel opens, allowing ions to enter or exit the cell.
7.36.38	(b) Stereocilia in the human ear are connected to mechanosensitive ion channels.
7.36.39	When a sound causes the stereocilia to move, mechanosensitive ion channels transduce the signal to the cochlear nerve.
7.36.40	Sensory receptors for different senses are very different from each other, and they are specialized according to the type of stimulus they sense: they have receptor specificity.
7.36.41	For example, touch receptors, light receptors, and sound receptors are each activated by different stimuli.
7.36.42	Touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound; they are sensitive only to touch or pressure.
7.36.43	However, stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain, as happens with olfaction, contributing to our sense of taste.
7.36.44	Encoding and Transmission of Sensory Information
7.36.45	Four aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems: the type of stimulus, the location of the stimulus in the receptive field, the duration of the stimulus, and the relative intensity of the stimulus.
7.36.46	Thus, action potentials transmitted over a sensory receptor’s afferent axons encode one type of stimulus, and this segregation of the senses is preserved in other sensory circuits.
7.36.47	For example, auditory receptors transmit signals over their own dedicated system, and electrical activity in the axons of the auditory receptors will be interpreted by the brain as an auditory stimulus—a sound.
7.36.48	The intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor.
7.36.49	Thus, an intense stimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials, and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate of production of action potentials.
7.36.50	A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated.
7.36.51	An intense stimulus might initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors, while a less intense stimulus might stimulate fewer receptors.
7.36.52	Integration of sensory information begins as soon as the information is received in the CNS, and the brain will further process incoming signals.
7.36.53	Perception Perception is an individual’s interpretation of a sensation.
7.36.54	Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors, perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor, but at higher levels in the nervous system, in the brain.
7.36.55	The brain distinguishes sensory stimuli through a sensory pathway: action potentials from sensory receptors travel along neurons that are dedicated to a particular stimulus.
7.36.56	These neurons are dedicated to that particular stimulus and synapse with particular neurons in the brain or spinal cord.
7.36.57	All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, are transmitted though the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus and to the appropriate region of the cortex.
7.36.58	Recall that the thalamus is a structure in the forebrain that serves as a clearinghouse and relay station for sensory (as well as motor) signals.
7.36.59	When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex (Figure 36.3) dedicated to processing that particular sense.
7.36.60	How are neural signals interpreted?
7.36.61	Interpretation of sensory signals between individuals of the same species is largely similar, owing to the inherited similarity of their nervous systems; however, there are some individual differences.
7.36.62	A good example of this is individual tolerances to a painful stimulus, such as dental pain, which certainly differ.
7.36.63	In humans, with the exception of olfaction, all sensory signals are routed from the (a) thalamus to (b) final processing regions in the cortex of the brain.

7.36.65	Somatosensation is a mixed sensory category and includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous membranes, as well from as the limbs and joints.
7.36.66	Somatosensation is also known as tactile sense, or more familiarly, as the sense of touch.
7.36.67	Somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior locations as well.
7.36.68	A variety of receptor types—embedded in the skin, mucous membranes, muscles, joints, internal organs, and cardiovascular system—play a role.
7.36.69	Recall that the epidermis is the outermost layer of skin in mammals.
7.36.70	It is relatively thin, is composed of keratin-filled cells, and has no blood supply.
7.36.71	The epidermis serves as a barrier to water and to invasion by pathogens.
7.36.72	Below this, the much thicker dermis contains blood vessels, sweat glands, hair follicles, lymph vessels, and lipid-secreting sebaceous glands (Figure 36.4).
7.36.73	Below the epidermis and dermis is the subcutaneous tissue, or hypodermis, the fatty layer that contains blood vessels, connective tissue, and the axons of sensory neurons.
7.36.74	The hypodermis, which holds about 50 percent of the body’s fat, attaches the dermis to the bone and muscle, and supplies nerves and blood vessels to the dermis.
7.36.75	Mammalian skin has three layers: an epidermis, a dermis, and a hypodermis.

7.36.77	Somatosensory Receptors
7.36.78	Sensory receptors are classified into five categories: mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, proprioceptors, pain receptors, and chemoreceptors.
7.36.79	These categories are based on the nature of stimuli each receptor class transduces.
7.36.80	What is commonly referred to as “touch” involves more than one kind of stimulus and more than one kind of receptor.
7.36.81	Mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated (that is, surrounded by a capsule) or unencapsulated (a group that includes free nerve endings).
7.36.82	A free nerve ending, as its name implies, is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron.
7.36.83	Free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin, and they extend into the middle of the epidermis.
7.36.84	Free nerve endings are sensitive to painful stimuli, to hot and cold, and to light touch.
7.36.85	They are slow to adjust to a stimulus and so are less sensitive to abrupt changes in stimulation.
7.36.86	There are three classes of mechanoreceptors: tactile, proprioceptors, and baroreceptors.
7.36.87	Mechanoreceptors sense stimuli due to physical deformation of their plasma membranes.
7.36.88	They contain mechanically gated ion channels whose gates open or close in response to pressure, touch, stretching, and sound.
7.36.89	”
7.36.90	There are four primary tactile mechanoreceptors in human skin: Merkel’s disks, Meissner’s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, and Pacinian corpuscle; two are located toward the surface of the skin and two are located deeper.
7.36.91	A fifth type of mechanoreceptor
7.36.92	, Krause end bulbs, are found only in specialized regions.
7.36.93	Merkel’s disks (shown in Figure 36.5) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis, both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin, that is, the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers, the soles of the feet, and the lips of humans and other primates.
7.36.94	Merkel’s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips.
7.36.95	They are slow-adapting, unencapsulated nerve endings, and they respond to light touch.
7.36.96	Light touch, also known as discriminative touch, is a light pressure that allows the location of a stimulus to be pinpointed.
7.36.97	The receptive fields of Merkel’s disks are small with well- defined borders.
7.36.98	That makes them finely sensitive to edges and they come into use in tasks such as typing on a keyboard.
7.36.99	Meissner’s corpuscles, (shown in Figure 36.6) also known as tactile corpuscles, are found in the upper dermis, but they project into the epidermis.
7.36.100	They, too, are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids.
7.36.101	They respond to fine touch and pressure, but they also respond to low-frequency vibration or flutter.
7.36.102	They are rapidly adapting, fluid-filled, encapsulated neurons with small, well-defined borders and are responsive to fine details.
7.36.103	Like Merkel’s disks, Meissner’s corpuscles are not as plentiful in the palms as they are in the fingertips.
7.36.104	Meissner corpuscles in the fingertips, such as the one viewed here using bright field light microscopy, allow for touch discrimination of fine detail.

7.36.106	Deeper in the epidermis, near the base, are Ruffini endings, which are also known as bulbous corpuscles.
7.36.107	They are found in both glabrous and hairy skin.
7.36.108	These are slow-adapting, encapsulated mechanoreceptors that detect skin stretch and deformations within joints, so they provide valuable feedback for gripping objects and controlling finger position and movement.
7.36.109	Thus, they also contribute to proprioception and kinesthesia.
7.36.110	Ruffini endings also detect warmth.
7.36.111	Note that these warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors.
7.36.112	It is not surprising, then, that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli.
7.36.113	Pacinian corpuscles (seen in Figure 36.7) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are structurally similar to Meissner’s corpuscles; they are found in the bone periosteum, joint capsules, pancreas and other viscera, breast, and genitals.
7.36.114	They are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient (but not prolonged) pressure and high-frequency vibration.
7.36.115	Pacinian receptors detect pressure and vibration by being compressed, stimulating their internal dendrites.
7.36.116	There are fewer Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings in skin than there are Merkel’s disks and Meissner’s corpuscles.
7.36.117	Pacinian corpuscles, such as these visualized using bright field light microscopy, detect pressure (touch) and high-frequency vibration.

7.36.119	In proprioception, proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals travel through myelinated afferent neurons running from the spinal cord to the medulla.
7.36.120	Neurons are not physically connected, but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses or “gaps” between communicating neurons.
7.36.121	Once in the medulla, the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus.
7.36.122	Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch, or lengthening of muscles.
7.36.123	Related to these are Golgi tendon organs, which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction.
7.36.124	Proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals come from limbs.
7.36.125	Unconscious proprioceptive signals run from the spinal cord to the cerebellum, the brain region that coordinates muscle contraction, rather than to the thalamus, like most other sensory information.
7.36.126	Barorecptors detect pressure changes in an organ.
7.36.127	They are found in the walls of the carotid artery and the aorta where they monitor blood pressure, and in the lungs where they detect the degree of lung expansion.
7.36.128	Stretch receptors are found at various sites in the digestive and urinary systems.
7.36.129	In addition to these two types of deeper receptors, there are also rapidly adapting hair receptors, which are found on nerve endings that wrap around the base of hair follicles.
7.36.130	There are a few types of hair receptors that detect slow and rapid hair movement, and they differ in their sensitivity to movement.
7.36.131	Some hair receptors also detect skin deflection, and certain rapidly adapting hair receptors allow detection of stimuli that have not yet touched the skin.
7.36.132	Integration of Signals from Mechanoreceptors
7.36.133	The configuration of the different types of receptors working in concert in human skin results in a very refined sense of touch.
7.36.134	The nociceptive receptors—those that detect pain—are located near the surface.
7.36.135	Small, finely calibrated mechanoreceptors—Merkel’s disks and Meissner’s corpuscles—are located in the upper layers and can precisely localize even gentle touch.
7.36.136	The large mechanoreceptors—Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings—are located in the lower layers and respond to deeper touch.
7.36.137	(Consider that the deep pressure that reaches those deeper receptors would not need to be finely localized.)
7.36.138	Both the upper and lower layers of the skin hold rapidly and slowly adapting receptors.
7.36.139	Both primary somatosensory cortex and secondary cortical areas are responsible for processing the complex picture of stimuli transmitted from the interplay of mechanoreceptors.
7.36.140	Density of Mechanoreceptors
7.36.141	The distribution of touch receptors in human skin is not consistent over the body.
7.36.142	In humans, touch receptors are less dense in skin covered with any type of hair, such as the arms, legs, torso, and face.
7.36.143	Touch receptors are denser in glabrous skin (the type found on human fingertips and lips, for example), which is typically more sensitive and is thicker than hairy skin (4 to 5 mm versus 2 to 3 mm).
7.36.144	How is receptor density estimated in a human subject?
7.36.145	The relative density of pressure receptors in different locations on the body can be demonstrated experimentally using a two-point discrimination test.
7.36.146	In this demonstration, two sharp points, such as two thumbtacks, are brought into contact with the subject’s skin (though not hard enough to cause pain or break the skin).
7.36.147	The subject reports if he or she feels one point or two points.
7.36.148	If the two points are felt as one point, it can be inferred that the two points are both in the receptive field of a single sensory receptor.
7.36.149	If two points are felt as two separate points, each is in the receptive field of two separate sensory receptors.
7.36.150	The points could then be moved closer and re-tested until the subject reports feeling only one point, and the size of the receptive field of a single receptor could be estimated from that distance.
7.36.151	Thermoreception
7.36.152	In addition to Krause end bulbs that detect cold and Ruffini endings that detect warmth, there are different types of cold receptors on some free nerve endings: thermoreceptors, located in the dermis, skeletal muscles, liver, and hypothalamus, that are activated by different temperatures.
7.36.153	Their pathways into the brain run from the spinal cord through the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex.
7.36.154	Warmth and cold information from the face travels through one of the cranial nerves to the brain.
7.36.155	You know from experience that a tolerably cold or hot stimulus can quickly progress to a much more intense stimulus that is no longer tolerable.
7.36.156	Any stimulus that is too intense can be perceived as pain because temperature sensations are conducted along the same pathways that carry pain sensations Pain Pain is the name given to nociception, which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage.
7.36.157	Pain is caused by true sources of injury, such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive chemical.
7.36.158	But pain also can be caused by harmless stimuli that mimic the action of damaging stimuli, such as contact with capsaicins, the compounds that cause peppers to taste hot and which are used in self-defense pepper sprays and certain topical medications.
7.36.159	Peppers taste “hot” because the protein receptors that bind capsaicin open the same calcium channels that are activated by warm receptors.
7.36.160	Nociception starts at the sensory receptors, but pain, inasmuch as it is the perception of nociception, does not start until it is communicated to the brain.
7.36.161	There are several nociceptive pathways to and through the brain.
7.36.162	Most axons carrying nociceptive information into the brain from the spinal cord project to the thalamus (as do other sensory neurons) and the neural signal undergoes final processing in the primary somatosensory cortex.
7.36.163	Interestingly, one nociceptive pathway projects not to the thalamus but directly to the hypothalamus in the forebrain, which modulates the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine functions of the autonomic nervous system.
7.36.164	Recall that threatening—or painful—stimuli stimulate the sympathetic branch of the visceral sensory system, readying a fight-or-flight response.
7.36.165	Taste, also called gustation, and smell, also called olfaction, are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors.
7.36.166	Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animals—whether potential mates, predators, or prey—or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival.
7.36.167	Similarly, the sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between types of foods.
7.36.168	While the value of a sense of smell is obvious, what is the value of a sense of taste?
7.36.169	Different tasting foods have different attributes, both helpful and harmful.
7.36.170	For example, sweet-tasting substances tend to be highly caloric, which could be necessary for survival in lean times.
7.36.171	Bitterness is associated with toxicity, and sourness is associated with spoiled food.
7.36.172	Salty foods are valuable in maintaining homeostasis by helping the body retain water and by providing ions necessary for cells to function.
7.36.173	Tastes and Odors Both taste and odor stimuli are molecules taken in from the environment.
7.36.174	The primary tastes detected by humans are sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami.
7.36.175	The first four tastes need little explanation.
7.36.176	The identification of umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently—it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth, but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later.
7.36.177	The taste of umami, also known as savoriness, is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L-glutamate.
7.36.178	In fact, monosodium glutamate, or MSG, is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods.
7.36.179	What is the adaptive value of being able to distinguish umami?
7.36.180	Savory substances tend to be high in protein.
7.36.181	All odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe.
7.36.182	If a substance does not release molecules into the air from its surface, it has no smell.
7.36.183	And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule, then that molecule has no smell.
7.36.184	Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations to allow us to sense about 10,000 different odors.
7.36.185	Compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory receptor types, and therefore probably sense more odors.
7.36.186	Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific chemoreceptors.
7.36.187	Although humans commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to create the perception of flavor.
7.36.188	A person’s perception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages.
7.36.189	Reception and Transduction Odorants (odor molecules) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium, the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity (as illustrated in Figure 36.8).
7.36.190	The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans.
7.36.191	Recall that sensory cells are neurons.
7.36.192	An olfactory receptor, which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron, responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain.
7.36.193	Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors, distributed among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors.
7.36.194	Twelve million seems like a large number of receptors, but compare that to other animals: rabbits have about 100 million, most dogs have about 1 billion, and bloodhounds—dogs selectively bred for their sense of smell—have about 4 billion.
7.36.195	The overall size of the olfactory epithelium also differs between species, with that of bloodhounds, for example, being many times larger than that of humans.
7.36.196	Olfactory neurons are bipolar neurons (neurons with two processes from the cell body).
7.36.197	Each neuron has a single dendrite buried in the olfactory epithelium, and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptor-laden, hair-like cilia that trap odorant molecules.
7.36.198	The sensory receptors on the cilia are proteins, and it is the variations in their amino acid chains that make the receptors sensitive to different odorants.
7.36.199	Each olfactory sensory neuron has only one type of receptor on its cilia, and the receptors are specialized to detect specific odorants, so the bipolar neurons themselves are specialized.
7.36.200	When an odorant binds with a receptor that recognizes it, the sensory neuron associated with the receptor is stimulated.
7.36.201	Olfactory stimulation is the only sensory information that directly reaches the cerebral cortex, whereas other sensations are relayed through the thalamus.
7.36.202	In the human olfactory system, (a) bipolar olfactory neurons extend from (b) the olfactory epithelium, where olfactory receptors are located, to the olfactory bulb.

7.36.204	Taste Detecting a taste (gustation) is fairly similar to detecting an odor (olfaction), given that both taste and smell rely on chemical receptors being stimulated by certain molecules.
7.36.205	The primary organ of taste is the taste bud.
7.36.206	A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors (taste cells) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae (singular: papilla) (illustrated in Figure 36.10).
7.36.207	There are several structurally distinct papillae.
7.36.208	Filiform papillae, which are located across the tongue, are tactile, providing friction that helps the tongue move substances, and contain no taste cells.
7.36.209	In contrast, fungiform papillae, which are located mainly on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, each contain one to eight taste buds and also have receptors for pressure and temperature.
7.36.210	The large circumvallate papillae contain up to 100 taste buds and form a V near the posterior margin of the tongue.
7.36.211	Foliate, circumvallate, and fungiform papillae are located on different regions of the tongue.
7.36.212	(b) Foliate papillae are prominent protrusions on this light micrograph.
7.36.213	(credit a: modification of work by NCI; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.36.214	In addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillae—leaf-like papillae located in parallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue, as seen in the Figure 36.10 micrograph.
7.36.215	Foliate papillae contain about 1,300 taste buds within their folds.
7.36.216	Finally, there are circumvallate papillae, which are wall-like papillae in the shape of an inverted “V” at the back of the tongue.
7.36.217	Each of these papillae is surrounded by a groove and contains about 250 taste buds.
7.36.218	Each taste bud’s taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days.
7.36.219	These are elongated cells with hair-like processes called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore (illustrate in Figure 36.11).
7.36.220	Food molecules ( tastants) are dissolved in saliva, and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli.
7.36.221	The receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue, outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent.
7.36.222	Pores in the tongue allow tastants to enter taste pores in the tongue.
7.36.223	(credit: modification of work by Vincenzo Rizzo)
7.36.224	In humans, there are five primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor.
7.36.225	Thus, like olfaction, each receptor is specific to its stimulus (tastant).
7.36.226	Transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms that reflect the molecular composition of the tastant.
7.36.227	A salty tastant (containing NaCl) provides the sodium ions (Na+) that enter the taste neurons and excite them directly.
7.36.228	Sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family.
7.36.229	Binding of an acid or other sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion (H+) concentrations in the taste neurons, thus depolarizing them.
7.36.230	Sweet, bitter, and umami tastants require a G-protein coupled receptor.
7.36.231	These tastants bind to their respective receptors, thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them.
7.36.232	Both tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age.
7.36.233	In humans, the senses decline dramatically by age 50 and continue to decline.
7.36.234	A child may find a food to be too spicy, whereas an elderly person may find the same food to be bland and unappetizing.
7.36.235	Smell and Taste in the Brain Olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin, unmyelinated axons.
7.36.236	The olfactory bulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli, and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor, so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant.
7.36.237	From glomeruli, olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus.
7.36.238	Recall that this is a different path from most other sensory information, which is sent directly to the thalamus before ending up in the cortex.
7.36.239	Olfactory signals also travel directly to the amygdala, thereafter reaching the hypothalamus, thalamus, and frontal cortex.
7.36.240	The last structure that olfactory signals directly travel to is a cortical center in the temporal lobe structure important in spatial, autobiographical, declarative, and episodic memories.
7.36.241	Olfaction is finally processed by areas of the brain that deal with memory, emotions, reproduction, and thought.
7.36.242	Taste neurons project from taste cells in the tongue, esophagus, and palate to the medulla, in the brainstem.
7.36.243	From the medulla, taste signals travel to the thalamus and then to the primary gustatory cortex.
7.36.244	Information from different regions of the tongue is segregated in the medulla, thalamus, and cortex.
7.36.245	Audition, or hearing, is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions.
7.36.246	It enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator, and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating.
7.36.247	On the other hand, although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the vestibular system is not involved in hearing.
7.36.248	Instead, an animal’s vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear and angular acceleration and deceleration, and balance.
7.36.249	Sound Auditory stimuli are sound waves, which are mechanical, pressure waves that move through a medium, such as air or water.
7.36.250	There are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves.
7.36.251	The speed of sound waves differs, based on altitude, temperature, and medium, but at sea level and a temperature of 20o C (68o F), sound waves travel in the air at about 343 meters per second.
7.36.252	As is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period, and amplitude.
7.36.253	Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time, and in sound is heard as pitch.
7.36.254	High-frequency (≥15.000Hz) sounds are higher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths; ≤100Hz) sounds.
7.36.255	Frequency is measured in cycles per second, and for sound, the most commonly used unit is hertz (Hz), or cycles per second.
7.36.256	Most humans can perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz.
7.36.257	Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies, but everyone’s ability to hear high frequencies decreases with age.
7.36.258	Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz; cats, 60,000 Hz; bats, 100,000 Hz; and dolphins 150,000 Hz, and American shad (Alosa sapidissima), a fish, can hear 180,000 Hz.
7.36.259	Those frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound.
7.36.260	Amplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in Figure 36.12.
7.36.261	The sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds.
7.36.262	For sound, volume is measured in decibels (dB).
7.36.263	The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point.
7.36.264	Humans speak normally at 60 decibels.
7.36.265	For sound waves, wavelength corresponds to pitch.
7.36.266	Amplitude of the wave corresponds to volume.
7.36.267	The sound wave shown with a dashed line is softer in volume than the sound wave shown with a solid line.

7.36.269	NIH) Reception of Sound
7.36.270	In mammals, sound waves are collected by the external, cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna, then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum, the innermost part of the outer ear (illustrated in Figure 36.13).
7.36.271	Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear.
7.36.272	The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles, which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear.
7.36.273	The three ossicles are the malleus (also known as the hammer), the incus (the anvil), and stapes (the stirrup).
7.36.274	The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup.
7.36.275	The three ossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing.
7.36.276	The malleus attaches at three points to the interior surface of the tympanic membrane.
7.36.277	The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes.
7.36.278	In humans, the stapes is not long enough to reach the tympanum.
7.36.279	If we did not have the malleus and the incus, then the vibrations of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear.
7.36.280	These bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds.
7.36.281	The ear ossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth: the bones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the vertebrate ear over evolutionary time.
7.36.282	Many animals (frogs, reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle ear to transmit vibrations to the middle ear.
7.36.283	Sound travels through the outer ear to the middle ear, which is bounded on its exterior by the tympanic membrane.
7.36.284	The middle ear contains three bones called ossicles that transfer the sound wave to the oval window, the exterior boundary of the inner ear.
7.36.285	The organ of Corti, which is the organ of sound transduction, lies inside the cochlea.
7.36.286	(credit: modification of work by Lars Chittka, Axel Brockmann)
7.36.287	Transduction of Sound Vibrating objects, such as vocal cords, create sound waves or pressure waves in the air.
7.36.288	When these pressure waves reach the ear, the ear transduces this mechanical stimulus (pressure wave) into a nerve impulse (electrical signal) that the brain perceives as sound.
7.36.289	The pressure waves strike the tympanum, causing it to vibrate.
7.36.290	The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear.
7.36.291	The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window, which is the outermost structure of the inner ear.
7.36.292	The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth, a bony, hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear.
7.36.293	Here, the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea.
7.36.294	The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid (perilymph) inside the cochlea.
7.36.295	The cochlea is a whorled structure, like the shell of a snail, and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal (as illustrated in Figure 36.14).
7.36.296	Inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea, curling toward the cochlea’s center.
7.36.297	The mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length, such that it is thicker, tauter, and narrower at the outside of the whorl (where the cochlea is largest), and thinner, floppier, and broader toward the apex, or center, of the whorl (where the cochlea is smallest).
7.36.298	Different regions of the basilar membrane vibrate according to the frequency of the sound wave conducted through the fluid in the cochlea.
7.36.299	For these reasons, the fluid-filled cochlea detects different wave frequencies (pitches) at different regions of the membrane.
7.36.300	When the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane, it flexes back and forth in a wave-like fashion.
7.36.301	Above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane.
7.36.302	The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti (spiral organ).
7.36.303	It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil, with their exposed short, hair-like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them.
7.36.304	The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row, numbering approximately 3,500.
7.36.305	The stereocilia from inner hair cells extend into small dimples on the tectorial membrane’s lower surface.
7.36.306	The outer hair cells are arranged in three or four rows.
7.36.307	They number approximately 12,000, and they function to fine tune incoming sound waves.
7.36.308	The longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial membrane.
7.36.309	All of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors, and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion channel (refer to Figure 36.2).
7.36.310	As a result, the hair cell membrane is depolarized, and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve.
7.36.311	Intensity (volume) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated.
7.36.312	The hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way.
7.36.313	The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions, according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it.
7.36.314	Likewise, the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive to a specific frequency of sound waves.
7.36.315	Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies, but they require stimulation of greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range.
7.36.316	The difference in response frequency between adjacent inner hair cells is about 0.2 percent.
7.36.317	Compare that to adjacent piano strings, which are about six percent different.
7.36.318	Place theory, which is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear, states that high frequency sounds selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port (the oval window).
7.36.319	Lower frequencies travel farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane.
7.36.320	The basic pitch- determining mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated.
7.36.321	The place theory is the first step toward an understanding of pitch perception.
7.36.322	Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear, it is thought that there must be some auditory “sharpening” mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution.
7.36.323	When sound waves produce fluid waves inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane flexes, bending the stereocilia that attach to the tectorial membrane.
7.36.324	Their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells, and auditory information travels along the neural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells (collectively, the auditory nerve) to the brain.
7.36.325	When the hairs bend, they release an excitatory neurotransmitter at a synapse with a sensory neuron, which then conducts action potentials to the central nervous system.
7.36.326	The cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve sends information on hearing.
7.36.327	The auditory system is very refined, and there is some modulation or “sharpening” built in.
7.36.328	The brain can send signals back to the cochlea, resulting in a change of length in the outer hair cells, sharpening or dampening the hair cells’ response to certain frequencies.
7.36.329	Higher Processing The inner hair cells are most important for conveying auditory information to the brain.
7.36.330	About 90 percent of the afferent neurons carry information from inner hair cells, with each hair cell synapsing with 10 or so neurons.
7.36.331	Outer hair cells connect to only 10 percent of the afferent neurons, and each afferent neuron innervates many hair cells.
7.36.332	The afferent, bipolar neurons that convey auditory information travel from the cochlea to the medulla, through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem, finally reaching the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe.
7.36.333	Vestibular Information
7.36.334	The stimuli associated with the vestibular system are linear acceleration (gravity) and angular acceleration and deceleration.
7.36.335	Gravity, acceleration, and deceleration are detected by evaluating the inertia on receptive cells in the vestibular system.
7.36.336	Gravity is detected through head position.
7.36.337	Angular acceleration and deceleration are expressed through turning or tilting of the head.
7.36.338	The vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system.
7.36.339	It utilizes hair cells just like the auditory system, but it excites them in different ways.
7.36.340	There are five vestibular receptor organs in the inner ear: the utricle, the saccule, and three semicircular canals.
7.36.341	Together, they make up what’s known as the vestibular labyrinth that is shown in Figure 36.15.
7.36.342	The utricle and saccule respond to acceleration in a straight line, such as gravity.
7.36.343	The roughly 30,000 hair cells in the utricle and 16,000 hair cells in the saccule lie below a gelatinous layer, with their stereocilia projecting into the gelatin.
7.36.344	Embedded in this gelatin are calcium carbonate crystals
7.36.345	—like tiny rocks.
7.36.346	When the head is tilted, the crystals continue to be pulled straight down by gravity, but the new angle of the head causes the gelatin to shift, thereby bending the stereocilia.
7.36.347	The bending of the stereocilia stimulates the neurons, and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted, allowing the maintenance of balance.
7.36.348	It is the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that deals with balance.
7.36.349	The structure of the vestibular labyrinth is shown.
7.36.350	(credit: modification of work by NIH)
7.36.351	The fluid-filled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles.
7.36.352	They are arranged in three spatial planes.
7.36.353	The base of each canal has a swelling that contains a cluster of hair cells.
7.36.354	The hairs project into a gelatinous cap called the cupula and monitor angular acceleration and deceleration from rotation.
7.36.355	They would be stimulated by driving your car around a corner, turning your head, or falling forward.
7.36.356	One canal lies horizontally, while the other two lie at about 45 degree angles to the horizontal axis, as illustrated in Figure 36.15.
7.36.357	When the brain processes input from all three canals together, it can detect angular acceleration or deceleration in three dimensions.
7.36.358	When the head turns, the fluid in the canals shifts, thereby bending stereocilia and sending signals to the brain.
7.36.359	Upon cessation accelerating or decelerating—or just moving
7.36.360	—
7.36.361	the movement of the fluid within the canals slows or stops.
7.36.362	For example, imagine holding a glass of water.
7.36.363	When moving forward, water may splash backwards onto the hand, and when motion has stopped, water may splash forward onto the fingers.
7.36.364	While in motion, the water settles in the glass and does not splash.
7.36.365	Note that the canals are not sensitive to velocity itself, but to changes in velocity, so moving forward at 60mph with your eyes closed would not give the sensation of movement, but suddenly accelerating or braking would stimulate the receptors.
7.36.366	Higher Processing Hair cells from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals also communicate through bipolar neurons to the cochlear nucleus in the medulla.
7.36.367	Cochlear neurons send descending projections to the spinal cord and ascending projections to the pons, thalamus, and cerebellum.
7.36.368	Connections to the cerebellum are important for coordinated movements.
7.36.369	There are also projections to the temporal cortex, which account for feelings of dizziness; projections to autonomic nervous system areas in the brainstem, which account for motion sickness; and projections to the primary somatosensory cortex, which monitors subjective measurements of the external world and self-movement.
7.36.370	People with lesions in the vestibular area of the somatosensory cortex see vertical objects in the world as being tilted.
7.36.371	Finally, the vestibular signals project to certain optic muscles to coordinate eye and head movements.
7.36.372	Vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images.
7.36.373	Animals are bombarded with sensory information, and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic.
7.36.374	Fortunately, the visual systems of species have evolved to attend to the most-important stimuli.
7.36.375	The importance of vision to humans is further substantiated by the fact that about one-third of the human cerebral cortex is dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual information.
7.36.376	Light
7.36.377	As with auditory stimuli, light travels in waves.
7.36.378	The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a medium—a gas, a liquid, or a solid.
7.36.379	In contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium; light can travel in a vacuum (Figure 36.16).
7.36.380	The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the fundamental unit of light—a packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon.
7.36.381	A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum shows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes radiation that we cannot see as light because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light.
7.36.382	Certain variables are important when discussing perception of light.
7.36.383	Wavelength (which varies inversely with frequency) manifests itself as hue.
7.36.384	Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths (and is lower frequency), while light at the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency).
7.36.385	The wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers (nm); one nanometer is one billionth of a meter.
7.36.386	Humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm.
7.36.387	Some other animals, though, can detect wavelengths outside of the human range.
7.36.388	For example, bees see near-ultraviolet light in order to locate nectar guides on flowers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat that prey gives off).
7.36.389	In the electromagnetic spectrum, visible light lies between 380 nm and 740 nm.
7.36.390	(credit: modification of work by NASA)
7.36.391	Wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity, or brightness.
7.36.392	The standard unit of intensity of light is the candela, which is approximately the luminous intensity of a one common candle.
7.36.393	Light waves travel 299,792 km per second in a vacuum, (and somewhat slower in various media such as air and water), and those waves arrive at the eye as long (red), medium (green), and short (blue) waves.
7.36.394	What is termed “white light” is light that is perceived as white by the human eye.
7.36.395	This effect is produced by light that stimulates equally the color receptors in the human eye.
7.36.396	The apparent color of an object is the color (or colors) that the object reflects.
7.36.397	Thus a red object reflects the red wavelengths in mixed (white) light and absorbs all other wavelengths of light.
7.36.398	Anatomy of the Eye
7.36.399	The photoreceptive cells of the eye, where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs, are located in the retina (shown in Figure 36.17) on the inner surface of the back of the eye.
7.36.400	But light does not impinge on the retina unaltered.
7.36.401	It passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina (Figure 36.17b).
7.36.402	The cornea, the front transparent layer of the eye, and the crystalline lens, a transparent convex structure behind the cornea, both refract (bend) light to focus the image on the retina.
7.36.403	The iris, which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye, is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.
7.36.404	In conditions of high ambient light, the iris contracts, reducing the size of the pupil at its center.
7.36.405	In conditions of low light, the iris relaxes and the pupil enlarges.
7.36.406	The main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis.
7.36.407	The lens is dynamic, focusing and re- focusing light as the eye rests on near and far objects in the visual field.
7.36.408	The lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken, changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina.
7.36.409	With age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens, and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results.
7.36.410	Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina.
7.36.411	Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short.
7.36.412	For both defects, images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry.
7.36.413	Myopia (nearsightedness) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina.
7.36.414	In this case, images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear.
7.36.415	There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina: rods and cones, named for their general appearance as illustrated in Figure 36.18.
7.36.416	Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina.
7.36.417	They detect dim light and are used primarily for peripheral and nighttime vision.
7.36.418	Cones are weakly photosensitive and are located near the center of the retina.
7.36.419	They respond to bright light, and their primary role is in daytime, color vision.
7.36.420	Rods and cones are photoreceptors in the retina.
7.36.421	Rods respond in low light and can detect only shades of gray.
7.36.422	Cones respond in intense light and are responsible for color vision.
7.36.423	(credit: modification of work by Piotr Sliwa)
7.36.424	The fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision.
7.36.425	The fovea has a high density of cones.
7.36.426	When you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light, the eyes orient so that the object’s image falls on the fovea.
7.36.427	However, when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light, the object can be better viewed by the peripheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina, rather than the cones at the center, that operate better in low light.
7.36.428	In humans, cones far outnumber rods in the fovea.
7.36.429	Transduction of Light
7.36.430	The rods and cones are the site of transduction of light to a neural signal.
7.36.431	Both rods and cones contain photopigments.
7.36.432	In vertebrates, the main photopigment, rhodopsin, has two main parts Figure 36.19): an opsin, which is a membrane protein (in the form of a cluster of α-helices that span the membrane), and retinal—a molecule that absorbs light.
7.36.433	When light hits a photoreceptor, it causes a shape change in the retinal, altering its structure from a bent (cis) form of the molecule to its linear (trans) isomer.
7.36.434	This isomerization of retinal activates the rhodopsin, starting a cascade of events that ends with the closing of Na+ channels in the membrane of the photoreceptor.
7.36.435	Thus, unlike most other sensory neurons (which become depolarized by exposure to a stimulus) visual receptors become hyperpolarized and thus driven away from threshold (Figure 36.20).
7.36.436	Rhodopsin, the photoreceptor in vertebrates, has two parts: the trans-membrane protein opsin, and retinal.
7.36.437	When light strikes retinal, it changes shape from (b) a cis to a trans form.
7.36.438	The signal is passed to a G-protein called transducin, triggering a series of downstream events.
7.36.439	When light strikes rhodopsin, the G-protein transducin is activated, which in turn activates phosphodiesterase.
7.36.440	Phosphodiesterase converts cGMP to GMP, thereby closing sodium channels.
7.36.441	As a result, the membrane becomes hyperpolarized.
7.36.442	The hyperpolarized membrane does not release glutamate to the bipolar cell.
7.36.443	Trichromatic Coding There are three types of cones (with different photopsins), and they differ in the wavelength to which they are most responsive, as shown in Figure 36.21.
7.36.444	Some cones are maximally responsive to short light waves of 420 nm, so they are called S cones (“S” for “short”); others respond maximally to waves of 530 nm (M cones, for “medium”); a third group responds maximally to light of longer wavelengths, at 560 nm (L, or “long” cones).
7.36.445	With only one type of cone, color vision would not be possible, and a two-cone (dichromatic) system has limitations.
7.36.446	Primates use a three-cone (trichromatic) system, resulting in full color vision.
7.36.447	The color we perceive is a result of the ratio of activity of our three types of cones.
7.36.448	The colors of the visual spectrum, running from long-wavelength light to short, are red (700 nm), orange (600 nm), yellow (565 nm), green (497 nm), blue (470 nm), indigo (450 nm), and violet (425 nm).
7.36.449	Humans have very sensitive perception of color and can distinguish about 500 levels of brightness, 200 different hues, and 20 steps of saturation, or about 2 million distinct colors.  
7.36.450	Human rod cells and the different types of cone cells each have an optimal wavelength.
7.36.451	However, there is considerable overlap in the wavelengths of light detected.
7.36.452	Retinal Processing Visual signals leave the cones and rods, travel to the bipolar cells, and then to ganglion cells.
7.36.453	A large degree of processing of visual information occurs in the retina itself, before visual information is sent to the brain.
7.36.454	Photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity.
7.36.455	That is, they are always slightly active even when not stimulated by light.
7.36.456	In neurons that exhibit tonic activity, the absence of stimuli maintains a firing rate at a baseline; while some stimuli increase firing rate from the baseline, and other stimuli decrease firing rate.
7.36.457	In the absence of light, the bipolar neurons that connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively inhibited by the rods and cones.
7.36.458	Exposure of the retina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes their inhibition of bipolar cells.
7.36.459	The now active bipolar cells in turn stimulate the ganglion cells, which send action potentials along their axons (which leave the eye as the optic nerve).
7.36.460	Thus, the visual system relies on change in retinal activity, rather than the absence or presence of activity, to encode visual signals for the brain.
7.36.461	Sometimes horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptors and to several bipolar cells.
7.36.462	When a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more distant photoreceptors and bipolar cells, creating lateral inhibition.
7.36.463	This inhibition sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the images by making regions receiving light appear lighter and dark surroundings appear darker.
7.36.464	Amacrine cells can distribute information from one bipolar cell to many ganglion cells.
7.36.465	You can demonstrate this using an easy demonstration to “
7.36.466	trick
7.36.467	” your retina and brain about the colors you are observing in your visual field.
7.36.468	Look fixedly at Figure 36.22 for about 45 seconds.
7.36.469	Then quickly shift your gaze to a sheet of blank white paper or a white wall.
7.36.470	You should see an afterimage of the Norwegian flag in its correct colors.
7.36.471	At this point, close your eyes for a moment, then reopen them, looking again at the white paper or wall; the afterimage of the flag should continue to appear as red, white, and blue.
7.36.472	What causes this?
7.36.473	According to an explanation called opponent process theory, as you gazed fixedly at the green, black, and yellow flag, your retinal ganglion cells that respond positively to green, black, and yellow increased their firing dramatically.
7.36.474	When you shifted your gaze to the neutral white ground, these ganglion cells abruptly decreased their activity and the brain interpreted this abrupt downshift as if the ganglion cells were responding now to their “opponent” colors: red, white, and blue, respectively, in the visual field.
7.36.475	Once the ganglion cells return to their baseline activity state, the false perception of color will disappear.
7.36.476	View this flag to understand how retinal processing works.
7.36.477	Stare at the center of the flag (indicated by the white dot) for 45 seconds, and then quickly look at a white background, noticing how colors appear.
7.36.478	Higher Processing
7.36.479	The myelinated axons of ganglion cells make up the optic nerves.
7.36.480	Within the nerves, different axons carry different qualities of the visual signal.
7.36.481	Some axons constitute the magnocellular (big cell) pathway, which carries information about form, movement, depth, and differences in brightness.
7.36.482	Other axons constitute the parvocellular (small cell) pathway, which carries information on color and fine detail.
7.36.483	Some visual information projects directly back into the brain, while other information crosses to the opposite side of the brain.
7.36.484	This crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma (Greek, for “crossing”) found at the base of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes.
7.36.485	Once in the brain, visual information is processed in several places, and its routes reflect the complexity and importance of visual information to humans and other animals.
7.36.486	One route takes the signals to the thalamus, which serves as the routing station for all incoming sensory impulses except olfaction.
7.36.487	In the thalamus, the magnocellular and parvocellular distinctions remain intact, and there are different layers of the thalamus dedicated to each.
7.36.488	When visual signals leave the thalamus, they travel to the primary visual cortex at the rear of the brain.
7.36.489	From the visual cortex, the visual signals travel in two directions.
7.36.490	One stream that projects to the parietal lobe, in the side of the brain, carries magnocellular (“where”) information.
7.36.491	A second stream projects to the temporal lobe and carries both magnocellular (“where”) and parvocellular (
7.36.492	“
7.36.493	what”) information.
7.36.494	Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain, where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information.
7.36.495	Finally, there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus.
7.36.496	The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body’s internal clock, which controls our circadian (day-long) cycle.
7.36.497	The SCN sends information to the pineal gland, which is important in sleep/wake patterns and annual cycles.
7.37.0	Introduction
7.37.1	An animal’s endocrine system controls body processes through the production, secretion, and regulation of hormones, which serve as chemical “messengers” functioning in cellular and organ activity and, ultimately, maintaining the body’s homeostasis.
7.37.2	The endocrine system plays a role in growth, metabolism, and sexual development.
7.37.3	In humans, common endocrine system diseases include thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus.
7.37.4	In organisms that undergo metamorphosis, the process is controlled by the endocrine system.
7.37.5	The transformation from tadpole to frog, for example, is complex and nuanced to adapt to specific environments and ecological circumstances.
7.37.6	Maintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs.
7.37.7	Communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals called hormones.
7.37.8	Hormones are released into body fluids (usually blood) that carry these chemicals to their target cells.
7.37.9	At the target cells, which are cells that have a receptor for a signal or ligand from a signal cell, the hormones elicit a response.
7.37.10	The cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system.
7.37.11	Examples of glands of the endocrine system include the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses to stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates.
7.37.12	Although there are many different hormones in the human body, they can be divided into three classes based on their chemical structure: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide (peptide and proteins) hormones.
7.37.13	One of the key distinguishing features of lipid-derived hormones is that they can diffuse across plasma membranes whereas the amino acid- derived and peptide hormones cannot.
7.37.14	Lipid-Derived Hormones (or Lipid-soluble Hormones)
7.37.15	Most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it, as illustrated in Figure 37.2.
7.37.16	The primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones.
7.37.17	Chemically, these hormones are usually ketones or alcohols; their chemical names will end in “-ol” for alcohols or “-one” for ketones.
7.37.18	Examples of steroid hormones include estradiol, which is an estrogen, or female sex hormone, and testosterone, which is an androgen, or male sex hormone.
7.37.19	These two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs, respectively.
7.37.20	Other steroid hormones include aldosterone and cortisol, which are released by the adrenal glands along with some other types of androgens.
7.37.21	Steroid hormones are insoluble in water, and they are transported by transport proteins in blood.
7.37.22	As a result, they remain in circulation longer than peptide hormones.
7.37.23	For example, cortisol has a half-life of 60 to 90 minutes, while epinephrine, an amino acid derived-hormone, has a half-life of approximately one minute.
7.37.24	The structures shown here represent (a) cholesterol, plus the steroid hormones (b) testosterone and (c) estradiol.
7.37.25	Amino Acid-Derived Hormones
7.37.26	The amino acid-derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, shown in Figure 37.3.
7.37.27	If a hormone is amino acid-derived, its chemical name will end in “-ine”.
7.37.28	Examples of amino acid-derived hormones include epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are synthesized in the medulla of the adrenal glands, and thyroxine, which is produced by the thyroid gland.
7.37.29	The pineal gland in the brain makes and secretes melatonin which regulates sleep cycles.
7.37.30	The hormone epinephrine, which triggers the fight-or-flight response, is derived from the amino acid tyrosine.
7.37.31	(b)
7.37.32	The hormone melatonin, which regulates circadian rhythms, is derived from the amino acid tryptophan.
7.37.33	Peptide Hormones
7.37.34	The structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain (chain of amino acids).
7.37.35	The peptide hormones include molecules that are short polypeptide chains, such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland.
7.37.36	This class also includes small proteins, like growth hormones produced by the pituitary, and large glycoproteins such as follicle-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary.
7.37.37	Figure 37.4 illustrates these peptide hormones.
7.37.38	Secreted peptides like insulin are stored within vesicles in the cells that synthesize them.
7.37.39	They are then released in response to stimuli such as high blood glucose levels in the case of insulin.
7.37.40	Amino acid-derived and polypeptide hormones are water- soluble and insoluble in lipids.
7.37.41	These hormones cannot pass through plasma membranes of cells; therefore, their receptors are found on the surface of the target cells.
7.37.42	The structures of peptide hormones (a) oxytocin, (b) growth hormone, and (c) follicle-stimulating hormone are shown.
7.37.43	These peptide hormones are much larger than those derived from cholesterol or amino acids.
7.37.44	Hormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific hormone receptors.
7.37.45	In this way, even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors.
7.37.46	Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different cells or may be limited to a small number of specialized cells.
7.37.47	For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity throughout the body.
7.37.48	Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of hormones.
7.37.49	The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cell’s sensitivity to that hormone, and the resulting cellular response.
7.37.50	Additionally, the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity.
7.37.51	In up-regulation, the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels, making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity.
7.37.52	When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels, called down-regulation, cellular activity is reduced.
7.37.53	Receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes.
7.37.54	Depending on the location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription, or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways.
7.37.55	Intracellular Hormone Receptors Lipid-derived (soluble) hormones such as steroid hormones diffuse across the membranes of the endocrine cell.
7.37.56	Once outside the cell, they bind to transport proteins that keep them soluble in the bloodstream.
7.37.57	At the target cell, the hormones are released from the carrier protein and diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane of cells.
7.37.58	The steroid hormones pass through the plasma membrane of a target cell and adhere to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus.
7.37.59	The cell signaling pathways induced by the steroid hormones regulate specific genes on the cell's DNA.
7.37.60	The hormones and receptor complex act as transcription regulators by increasing or decreasing the synthesis of mRNA molecules of specific genes.
7.37.61	This, in turn, determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering gene expression.
7.37.62	This protein can be used either to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions.
7.37.63	In this way, the steroid hormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated in Figure 37.5.  
7.37.64	Other lipid-soluble hormones that are not steroid hormones, such as vitamin D and thyroxine, have receptors located in the nucleus.
7.37.65	The hormones diffuse across both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope, then bind to receptors in the nucleus.
7.37.66	The hormone-receptor complex stimulates transcription of specific genes.
7.37.67	Plasma Membrane Hormone Receptors Amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-derived (lipid-soluble) and therefore cannot diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells.
7.37.68	Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, via plasma membrane hormone receptors.
7.37.69	Unlike steroid hormones, lipid insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they cannot enter the cell and act directly on DNA.
7.37.70	Binding of these hormones to a cell surface receptor results in activation of a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out the specific effects associated with the hormone.
7.37.71	In this way, nothing passes through the cell membrane; the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell.
7.37.72	The hormone that initiates the signaling pathway is called a first messenger, which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm, as illustrated in Figure 37.6.
7.37.73	The amino acid-derived hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to beta-adrenergic receptors on the plasma membrane of cells.
7.37.74	Hormone binding to receptor activates a G-protein, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase, converting ATP to cAMP.
7.37.75	cAMP is a second messenger that mediates a cell-specific response.
7.37.76	An enzyme called phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP, terminating the signal.
7.37.77	One very important second messenger is cyclic AMP (cAMP).
7.37.78	When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor, a G- protein that is associated with the receptor is activated; G-proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in the cell membrane.
7.37.79	When a hormone is not bound to the receptor, the G-protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate, or GDP.
7.37.80	When a hormone binds to the receptor, the G-protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate, or GTP, in place of GDP.
7.37.81	After binding, GTP is hydrolysed by the G-protein into GDP and becomes inactive.
7.37.82	The activated G-protein in turn activates a membrane-bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase.
7.37.83	Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP.
7.37.84	cAMP, in turn, activates a group of proteins called protein kinases, which transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a substrate molecule in a process called phosphorylation.
7.37.85	The phosphorylation of a substrate molecule changes its structural orientation, thereby activating it.
7.37.86	These activated molecules can then mediate changes in cellular processes.
7.37.87	The effect of a hormone is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses.
7.37.88	The binding of a hormone at a single receptor causes the activation of many G-proteins, which activates adenylyl cyclase.
7.37.89	Each molecule of adenylyl cyclase then triggers the formation of many molecules of cAMP.
7.37.90	Further amplification occurs as protein kinases, once activated by cAMP, can catalyze many reactions.
7.37.91	In this way, a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product.
7.37.92	To stop hormone activity, cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase, or PDE.
7.37.93	PDE is always present in the cell and breaks down cAMP to control hormone activity, preventing overproduction of cellular products.
7.37.94	The specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm.
7.37.95	Cellular responses to hormone binding of a receptor include altering membrane permeability and metabolic pathways, stimulating synthesis of proteins and enzymes, and activating hormone release.
7.37.96	Hormones have a wide range of effects and modulate many different body processes.
7.37.97	The key regulatory processes that will be examined here are those affecting the excretory system, the reproductive system, metabolism, blood calcium concentrations, growth, and the stress response.
7.37.98	Hormonal Regulation of the Excretory System
7.37.99	Maintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or over-hydration (hyponatremia).
7.37.100	The water concentration of the body is monitored by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which detect the concentration of electrolytes in the extracellular fluid.
7.37.101	The concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused by excessive perspiration, inadequate water intake, or low blood volume due to blood loss.
7.37.102	An increase in blood electrolyte levels results in a neuronal signal being sent from the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei.
7.37.103	The pituitary gland has two components: anterior and posterior.
7.37.104	The anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones.
7.37.105	The posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus.
7.37.106	It is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the hypothalamus.
7.37.107	The hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is transported to and released from the posterior pituitary gland.
7.37.108	The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the kidneys.
7.37.109	As ADH (which is also known as vasopressin) causes direct water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, salts and wastes are concentrated in what will eventually be excreted as urine.
7.37.110	The hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of ADH secretion, either by regulating blood volume or the concentration of water in the blood.
7.37.111	Dehydration or physiological stress can cause an increase of osmolarity above 300 mOsm/L, which in turn, raises ADH secretion and water will be retained, causing an increase in blood pressure.
7.37.112	ADH travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys.
7.37.113	Once at the kidneys, ADH changes the kidneys to become more permeable to water by temporarily inserting water channels, aquaporins, into the kidney tubules.
7.37.114	Water moves out of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins, reducing urine volume.
7.37.115	The water is reabsorbed into the capillaries lowering blood osmolarity back toward normal.
7.37.116	As blood osmolarity decreases, a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced.
7.37.117	ADH release can be reduced by certain substances, including alcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration.
7.37.118	Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus.
7.37.119	If the posterior pituitary does not release enough ADH, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine.
7.37.120	This causes increased thirst, but water taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed.
7.37.121	If the condition is not severe, dehydration may not occur, but severe cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration.
7.37.122	Another hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids is aldosterone, a steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex.
7.37.123	In contrast to ADH, which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain proper water balance, aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules.
7.37.124	Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the concentrations of minerals Na+ and K+, aldosterone is referred to as a mineralocorticoid, a corticosteroid that affects ion and water balance.
7.37.125	Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels, blood volume, or blood pressure, or an increase in blood potassium levels.
7.37.126	It also prevents the loss of Na+ from sweat, saliva, and gastric juice.
7.37.127	The reabsorption of Na+ also results in the osmotic reabsorption of water, which alters blood volume and blood pressure.
7.37.128	Aldosterone production can be stimulated by low blood pressure, which triggers a sequence of chemical release, as illustrated in Figure 37.7.
7.37.129	When blood pressure drops, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated.
7.37.130	Cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which regulates the functions of the nephrons of the kidney, detect this and release renin.
7.37.131	Renin, an enzyme, circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen.
7.37.132	When angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin, it produces angiotensin
7.37.133	I, which is then converted into angiotensin II in the lungs.
7.37.134	Angiotensin II functions as a hormone and then causes the release of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, resulting in increased Na+ reabsorption, water retention, and an increase in blood pressure.
7.37.135	Angiotensin II in addition to being a potent vasoconstrictor also causes an increase in ADH and increased thirst, both of which help to raise blood pressure.
7.37.136	ADH and aldosterone increase blood pressure and volume.
7.37.137	Angiotensin II stimulates release of these hormones.
7.37.138	Angiotensin II, in turn, is formed when renin cleaves angiotensinogen.
7.37.139	(credit: modification of work by Mikael Häggström) Hormonal Regulation of the Reproductive System Regulation of the reproductive system is a process that requires the action of hormones from the pituitary gland, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads.
7.37.140	During puberty in both males and females, the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the production and release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland.
7.37.141	These hormones regulate the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) and therefore are called gonadotropins.
7.37.142	In both males and females, FSH stimulates gamete production and LH stimulates production of hormones by the gonads.
7.37.143	An increase in gonad hormone levels inhibits GnRH production through a negative feedback loop.
7.37.144	Regulation of the Male Reproductive System
7.37.145	In males, FSH stimulates the maturation of sperm cells.
7.37.146	FSH production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin, which is released by the testes.
7.37.147	LH stimulates production of the sex hormones ( androgens) by the interstitial cells of the testes and therefore is also called interstitial cell-stimulating hormone.
7.37.148	The most widely known androgen in males is testosterone.
7.37.149	Testosterone promotes the production of sperm and masculine characteristics.
7.37.150	The adrenal cortex also produces small amounts of testosterone precursor, although the role of this additional hormone production is not fully understood.
7.37.151	Regulation of the Female Reproductive System
7.37.152	In females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles.
7.37.153	Follicle cells produce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production.
7.37.154	LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries, as illustrated in Figure 37.9.
7.37.155	Estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy.
7.37.156	Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both estradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.
7.37.157	Hormonal regulation of the female reproductive system involves hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries.
7.37.158	In addition to producing FSH and LH, the anterior portion of the pituitary gland also produces the hormone prolactin (PRL) in females.
7.37.159	Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth.
7.37.160	Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) and prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH), which is now known to be dopamine.
7.37.161	PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it.
7.37.162	The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth.
7.37.163	The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks.
7.37.164	Stretching of tissues in the uterus and cervix stimulates oxytocin release during childbirth.
7.37.165	Contractions increase in intensity as blood levels of oxytocin rise via a positive feedback mechanism until the birth is complete.
7.37.166	Oxytocin also stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells around the milk-producing mammary glands.
7.37.167	As these cells contract, milk is forced from the secretory alveoli into milk ducts and is ejected from the breasts in milk ejection (“let-down”) reflex.
7.37.168	Oxytocin release is stimulated by the suckling of an infant, which triggers the synthesis of oxytocin in the hypothalamus and its release into circulation at the posterior pituitary.
7.37.169	Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism Blood glucose levels vary widely over the course of a day as periods of food consumption alternate with periods of fasting.
7.37.170	Insulin and glucagon are the two hormones primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis of blood glucose levels.
7.37.171	Additional regulation is mediated by the thyroid hormones.
7.37.172	Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon Cells of the body require nutrients in order to function, and these nutrients are obtained through feeding.
7.37.173	In order to manage nutrient intake, storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary, the body uses hormones to moderate energy stores.
7.37.174	Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which are stimulated to release insulin as blood glucose levels rise (for example, after a meal is consumed).
7.37.175	Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and utilization by target cells, which use glucose for ATP production.
7.37.176	It also stimulates the liver to convert glucose to glycogen, which is then stored by cells for later use.
7.37.177	Insulin also increases glucose transport into certain cells, such as muscle cells and the liver.
7.37.178	This results from an insulin-mediated increase in the number of glucose transporter proteins in cell membranes, which remove glucose from circulation by facilitated diffusion.
7.37.179	As insulin binds to its target cell via insulin receptors and signal transduction, it triggers the cell to incorporate glucose transport proteins into its membrane.
7.37.180	This allows glucose to enter the cell, where it can be used as an energy source.
7.37.181	However, this does not occur in all cells: some cells, including those in the kidneys and brain, can access glucose without the use of insulin.
7.37.182	Insulin also stimulates the conversion of glucose to fat in adipocytes and the synthesis of proteins.
7.37.183	These actions mediated by insulin cause blood glucose concentrations to fall, called a hypoglycemic “low sugar” effect, which inhibits further insulin release from beta cells through a negative feedback loop.
7.37.184	Impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus, the main symptoms of which are illustrated in Figure 37.10.
7.37.185	This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas, or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin.
7.37.186	This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells, causing high levels of blood glucose, or hyperglycemia (high sugar).
7.37.187	High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine, resulting in glucose being lost in urine.
7.37.188	High glucose levels also result in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys, causing high amounts of urine to be produced; this may result in dehydration.
7.37.189	Over time, high blood glucose levels can cause nerve damage to the eyes and peripheral body tissues, as well as damage to the kidneys and cardiovascular system.
7.37.190	Oversecretion of insulin can cause hypoglycemia, low blood glucose levels.
7.37.191	This causes insufficient glucose availability to cells, often leading to muscle weakness, and can sometimes cause unconsciousness or death if left untreated.
7.37.192	The main symptoms of diabetes are shown.
7.37.193	(credit: modification of work by Mikael Häggström)
7.37.194	When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels, for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise, the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas.
7.37.195	Glucagon raises blood glucose levels, eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect, by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis.
7.37.196	Glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the liver cells.
7.37.197	Glucagon also stimulates absorption of amino acids from the blood by the liver, which then converts them to glucose.
7.37.198	This process of glucose synthesis is called gluconeogenesis.
7.37.199	Glucagon also stimulates adipose cells to release fatty acids into the blood.
7.37.200	These actions mediated by glucagon result in an increase in blood glucose levels to normal homeostatic levels.
7.37.201	Rising blood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon release by the pancreas via a negative feedback mechanism.
7.37.202	In this way, insulin and glucagon work together to maintain homeostatic glucose levels, as shown in Figure 37.11.
7.37.203	Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Thyroid Hormones
7.37.204	The basal metabolic rate, which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest, is determined by two hormones produced by the thyroid gland: thyroxine, also known as tetraiodothyronine or T4, and triiodothyronine, also known as T3.
7.37.205	These hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain, uterus, testes, blood cells, and spleen.
7.37.206	They are transported across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to receptors on the mitochondria resulting in increased ATP production.
7.37.207	In the nucleus, T3 and T4 activate genes involved in energy production and glucose oxidation.
7.37.208	This results in increased rates of metabolism and body heat production, which is known as the hormone’s calorigenic effect.
7.37.209	T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the anterior pituitary.
7.37.210	TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin.
7.37.211	Thyroglobulin is present in the follicles of the thyroid, and is converted into thyroid hormones with the addition of iodine.
7.37.212	Iodine is formed from iodide ions that are actively transported into the thyroid follicle from the bloodstream.
7.37.213	A peroxidase enzyme then attaches the iodine to the tyrosine amino acid found in thyroglobulin.
7.37.214	T3 has three iodine ions attached, while T4 has four iodine ions attached.
7.37.215	T3 and T4 are then released into the bloodstream, with T4 being released in much greater amounts than T3.
7.37.216	As T3 is more active than T4 and is responsible for most of the effects of thyroid hormones, tissues of the body convert T4 to T3 by the removal of an iodine ion.
7.37.217	Most of the released T3 and T4 becomes attached to transport proteins in the bloodstream and is unable to cross the plasma membrane of cells.
7.37.218	These protein-bound molecules are only released when blood levels of the unattached hormone begin to decline.
7.37.219	In this way, a week’s worth of reserve hormone is maintained in the blood.
7.37.220	Increased T3 and T4 levels in the blood inhibit the release of TSH, which results in lower T3 and T4 release from the thyroid.
7.37.221	The follicular cells of the thyroid require iodides (anions of iodine) in order to synthesize T3 and T4.
7.37.222	Iodides obtained from the diet are actively transported into follicle cells resulting in a concentration that is approximately 30 times higher than in blood.
7.37.223	The typical diet in North America provides more iodine than required due to the addition of iodide to table salt.
7.37.224	Inadequate iodine intake, which occurs in many developing countries, results in an inability to synthesize T3 and T4 hormones.
7.37.225	The thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called goiter, which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the formation of thyroid hormone.
7.37.226	Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid, and TSH stimulation results in higher levels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid.
7.37.227	In the absence of iodine, this is not converted to thyroid hormone, and colloid begins to accumulate more and more in the thyroid gland, leading to goiter.
7.37.228	Disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones.
7.37.229	Hypothyroidism, underproduction of the thyroid hormones, can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain, sensitivity to cold, and reduced mental activity, among other symptoms.
7.37.230	In children, hypothyroidism can cause cretinism, which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects.
7.37.231	Hyperthyroidism, the overproduction of thyroid hormones, can lead to an increased metabolic rate and its effects: weight loss, excess heat production, sweating, and an increased heart rate.
7.37.232	Graves’ disease is one example of a hyperthyroid condition.
7.37.233	Hormonal Control of Blood Calcium Levels Regulation of blood calcium concentrations is important for generation of muscle contractions and nerve impulses, which are electrically stimulated.
7.37.234	If calcium levels get too high, membrane permeability to sodium decreases and membranes become less responsive.
7.37.235	If calcium levels get too low, membrane permeability to sodium increases and convulsions or muscle spasms can result.
7.37.236	Blood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is produced by the parathyroid glands, as illustrated in Figure 37.12.
7.37.237	PTH is released in response to low blood Ca2+ levels.
7.37.238	PTH increases Ca2+ levels by targeting the skeleton, the kidneys, and the intestine.
7.37.239	In the skeleton, PTH stimulates osteoclasts, which causes bone to be reabsorbed, releasing Ca2
7.37.240	+ from bone into the blood.
7.37.241	PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, reducing Ca2+ deposition in bone.
7.37.242	In the intestines, PTH increases dietary Ca2+ absorption, and in the kidneys, PTH stimulates reabsorption of the CA2+.
7.37.243	While PTH acts directly on the kidneys to increase Ca2+ reabsorption, its effects on the intestine are indirect.
7.37.244	PTH triggers the formation of calcitriol, an active form of vitamin D, which acts on the intestines to increase absorption of dietary calcium.
7.37.245	PTH release is inhibited by rising blood calcium levels.
7.37.246	Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is released in response to low blood calcium levels.
7.37.247	It increases blood calcium levels by targeting the skeleton, the kidneys, and the intestine.
7.37.248	(credit: modification of work by Mikael Häggström)
7.37.249	Hyperparathyroidism results from an overproduction of parathyroid hormone.
7.37.250	This results in excessive calcium being removed from bones and introduced into blood circulation, producing structural weakness of the bones, which can lead to deformation and fractures, plus nervous system impairment due to high blood calcium levels.
7.37.251	Hypoparathyroidism, the underproduction of PTH, results in extremely low levels of blood calcium, which causes impaired muscle function and may result in tetany (severe sustained muscle contraction).
7.37.252	The hormone calcitonin, which is produced by the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid, has the opposite effect on blood calcium levels as does PTH.
7.37.253	Calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts, stimulating osteoblasts, and stimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys.
7.37.254	This results in calcium being added to the bones to promote structural integrity.
7.37.255	Calcitonin is most important in children (when it stimulates bone growth), during pregnancy (when it reduces maternal bone loss), and during prolonged starvation (because it reduces bone mass loss).
7.37.256	In healthy nonpregnant, unstarved adults, the role of calcitonin is unclear.
7.37.257	Hormonal Regulation of Growth Hormonal regulation is required for the growth and replication of most cells in the body.
7.37.258	Growth hormone (GH), produced by the anterior portion of the pituitary gland, accelerates the rate of protein synthesis, particularly in skeletal muscle and bones.
7.37.259	Growth hormone has direct and indirect mechanisms of action.
7.37.260	The first direct action of GH is stimulation of triglyceride breakdown (lipolysis) and release into the blood by adipocytes.
7.37.261	This results in a switch by most tissues from utilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids.
7.37.262	This process is called a glucose-sparing effect.
7.37.263	In another direct mechanism, GH stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver; the glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose.
7.37.264	Blood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs.
7.37.265	The GH mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus.
7.37.266	The indirect mechanism of GH action is mediated by insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) or somatomedins, which are a family of growth-promoting proteins produced by the liver, which stimulates tissue growth.
7.37.267	IGFs stimulate the uptake of amino acids from the blood, allowing the formation of new proteins, particularly in skeletal muscle cells, cartilage cells, and other target cells, as shown in Figure 37.13.
7.37.268	This is especially important after a meal, when glucose and amino acid concentration levels are high in the blood.
7.37.269	GH levels are regulated by two hormones produced by the hypothalamus.
7.37.270	GH release is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and is inhibited by growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH), also called somatostatin.
7.37.271	Growth hormone directly accelerates the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and bones.
7.37.272	Insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is activated by growth hormone and also allows formation of new proteins in muscle cells and bone.
7.37.273	(credit: modification of work by Mikael Häggström)
7.37.274	A balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development.
7.37.275	Underproduction of GH in adults does not appear to cause any abnormalities, but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism, in which growth is reduced.
7.37.276	Pituitary dwarfism is characterized by symmetric body formation.
7.37.277	In some cases, individuals are under 30 inches in height.
7.37.278	Oversecretion of growth hormone can lead to gigantism in children, causing excessive growth.
7.37.279	In some documented cases, individuals can reach heights of over eight feet.
7.37.280	In adults, excessive GH can lead to acromegaly, a condition in which there is enlargement of bones in the face, hands, and feet that are still capable of growth.
7.37.281	Hormonal Regulation of Stress
7.37.282	When a threat or danger is perceived, the body responds by releasing hormones that will ready it for the “fight-or-flight” response.
7.37.283	The effects of this response are familiar to anyone who has been in a stressful situation: increased heart rate, dry mouth, and hair standing up.
7.37.284	The sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus.
7.37.285	Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla (which mediates short-term stress responses) via nerve impulses, and the adrenal cortex, which mediates long-term stress responses, via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is produced by the anterior pituitary.
7.37.286	Short-term Stress Response
7.37.287	When presented with a stressful situation, the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy.
7.37.288	The hormones epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) are released by the adrenal medulla.
7.37.289	How do these hormones provide a burst of energy?
7.37.290	Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver and skeletal muscles to break down glycogen and by stimulating glucose release by liver cells.
7.37.291	Additionally, these hormones increase oxygen availability to cells by increasing the heart rate and dilating the bronchioles.
7.37.292	The hormones also prioritize body function by increasing blood supply to essential organs such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles, while restricting blood flow to organs not in immediate need, such as the skin, digestive system, and kidneys.
7.37.293	Epinephrine and norepinephrine are collectively called catecholamines.
7.37.294	Long-term Stress Response Long-term stress response differs from short-term stress response.
7.37.295	The body cannot sustain the bursts of energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine for long times.
7.37.296	Instead, other hormones come into play.
7.37.297	In a long-term stress response, the hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland.
7.37.298	The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH to release steroid hormones called corticosteroids.
7.37.299	Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target cells.
7.37.300	They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism.
7.37.301	There are two main corticosteroids: glucocorticoids such as cortisol, and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone.
7.37.302	These hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue.
7.37.303	The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for ATP production.
7.37.304	The glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis.
7.37.305	Glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system.
7.37.306	For example, cortisone is used as an anti-inflammatory medication; however, it cannot be used long term as it increases susceptibility to disease due to its immune-suppressing effects.
7.37.307	Mineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body.
7.37.308	The hormone aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume.
7.37.309	Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushing’s disease, characterized by a shifting of fat storage areas of the body.
7.37.310	This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck, and excessive glucose in the blood.
7.37.311	Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addison’s disease, which may result in bronzing of the skin, hypoglycemia, and low electrolyte levels in the blood.
7.37.312	Hormone production and release are primarily controlled by negative feedback.
7.37.313	In negative feedback systems, a stimulus elicits the release of a substance; once the substance reaches a certain level, it sends a signal that stops further release of the substance.
7.37.314	In this way, the concentration of hormones in blood is maintained within a narrow range.
7.37.315	For example, the anterior pituitary signals the thyroid to release thyroid hormones.
7.37.316	Increasing levels of these hormones in the blood then give feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit further signaling to the thyroid gland, as illustrated in Figure 37.14.
7.37.317	There are three mechanisms by which endocrine glands are stimulated to synthesize and release hormones: humoral stimuli, hormonal stimuli, and neural stimuli.
7.37.318	Humoral Stimuli
7.37.319	The term
7.37.320	“humoral” is derived from the term “humor,” which refers to bodily fluids such as blood.
7.37.321	A humoral stimulus refers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration in the blood.
7.37.322	For example, a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin.
7.37.323	Insulin causes blood glucose levels to drop, which signals the pancreas to stop producing insulin in a negative feedback loop.
7.37.324	Hormonal Stimuli Hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone.
7.37.325	A number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands.
7.37.326	For example, the hypothalamus produces hormones that stimulate the anterior portion of the pituitary gland.
7.37.327	The anterior pituitary in turn releases hormones that regulate hormone production by other endocrine glands.
7.37.328	The anterior pituitary releases the thyroid-stimulating hormone, which then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce the hormones T3 and T4.
7.37.329	As blood concentrations of T3 and T4 rise, they inhibit both the pituitary and the hypothalamus in a negative feedback loop.
7.37.330	Neural Stimuli
7.37.331	In some cases, the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones, which is referred to as neural stimuli.
7.37.332	Recall that in a short-term stress response, the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for providing the bursts of energy required for the body to respond.
7.37.333	Here, neuronal signaling from the sympathetic nervous system directly stimulates the adrenal medulla to release the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to stress.
7.37.334	Both the endocrine and nervous systems use chemical signals to communicate and regulate the body's physiology.
7.37.335	The endocrine system releases hormones that act on target cells to regulate development, growth, energy metabolism, reproduction, and many behaviors.
7.37.336	The nervous system releases neurotransmitters or neurohormones that regulate neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells.
7.37.337	Because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones, the nervous and endocrine systems work in a coordinated manner to regulate the body's physiology.
7.37.338	Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis
7.37.339	The hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems.
7.37.340	The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain.
7.37.341	It receives input from the body and other brain areas and initiates endocrine responses to environmental changes.
7.37.342	The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting them along axons to the posterior pituitary gland.
7.37.343	It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland.
7.37.344	The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control.
7.37.345	The pituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or “master gland” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica, a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated in Figure 37.15.
7.37.346	It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk (or infundibulum).
7.37.347	The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release-inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus.
7.37.348	The pituitary has two distinct regions—the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary—which between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones.
7.37.349	The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland contains axons of the hypothalamic neurons.
7.37.350	The pituitary gland is located at (a) the base of the brain and (b) connected to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk.
7.37.351	(credit a: modification of work by NCI; credit b: modification of work by Gray’s Anatomy)
7.37.352	Anterior Pituitary
7.37.353	The anterior pituitary gland, or adenohypophysis, is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus, down along the infundibulum, and to the anterior pituitary.
7.37.354	This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system.
7.37.355	A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another; therefore, the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system.
7.37.356	The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), melanin-stimulating hormone (MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH).
7.37.357	Anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic hormones, because they control the functioning of other organs.
7.37.358	While these hormones are produced by the anterior pituitary, their production is controlled by regulatory hormones produced by the hypothalamus.
7.37.359	These regulatory hormones can be releasing hormones or inhibiting hormones, causing more or less of the anterior pituitary hormones to be secreted.
7.37.360	These travel from the hypothalamus through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary where they exert their effect.
7.37.361	Negative feedback then regulates how much of these regulatory hormones are released and how much anterior pituitary hormone is secreted.
7.37.362	Posterior Pituitary
7.37.363	The posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary.
7.37.364	It is a part of the brain, extending down from the hypothalamus, and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells, which support axons that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary.
7.37.365	The posterior pituitary and the infundibulum together are referred to as the neurohypophysis.
7.37.366	The hormones antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, and oxytocin are produced by neurons in the hypothalamus and transported within these axons along the infundibulum to the posterior pituitary.
7.37.367	They are released into the circulatory system via neural signaling from the hypothalamus.
7.37.368	These hormones are considered to be posterior pituitary hormones, even though they are produced by the hypothalamus, because that is where they are released into the circulatory system.
7.37.369	The posterior pituitary itself does not produce hormones, but instead
7.37.370	stores hormones produced by the hypothalamus and releases them into the blood stream.
7.37.371	Thyroid Gland
7.37.372	The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just below the larynx and in front of the trachea, as shown in Figure 37.16.
7.37.373	It is a butterfly-shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus.
7.37.374	It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular system.
7.37.375	When the thyroid swells due to dysfunction, it can be felt under the skin of the neck.
7.37.376	This illustration shows the location of the thyroid gland.
7.37.377	The thyroid gland is made up of many spherical thyroid follicles, which are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium.
7.37.378	These follicles contain a viscous fluid, called colloid, which stores the glycoprotein thyroglobulin, the precursor to the thyroid hormones.
7.37.379	The follicles produce hormones that can be stored in the colloid or released into the surrounding capillary network for transport to the rest of the body via the circulatory system.
7.37.380	Thyroid follicle cells synthesize the hormone thyroxine, which is also known as T4 because it contains four atoms of iodine, and triiodothyronine, also known as T3 because it contains three atoms of iodine.
7.37.381	Follicle cells are stimulated to release stored T3 and T4 by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the anterior pituitary.
7.37.382	These thyroid hormones increase the rates of mitochondrial ATP production.
7.37.383	A third hormone, calcitonin, is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid either releasing hormones or inhibiting hormones.
7.37.384	Calcitonin release is not controlled by TSH, but instead is released when calcium ion concentrations in the blood rise.
7.37.385	Calcitonin functions to help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids.
7.37.386	It acts in the bones to inhibit osteoclast activity and in the kidneys to stimulate excretion of calcium.
7.37.387	The combination of these two events lowers body fluid levels of calcium.
7.37.388	Parathyroid Glands
7.37.389	Most people have four parathyroid glands; however, the number can vary from two to six.
7.37.390	These glands are located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland, as shown in Figure 37.17.
7.37.391	Normally, there is a superior gland and an inferior gland associated with each of the thyroid’s two lobes.
7.37.392	Each parathyroid gland is covered by connective tissue and contains many secretory cells that are associated with a capillary network.
7.37.393	he parathyroid glands are located on the posterior of the thyroid gland.
7.37.394	(credit: modification of work by NCI)
7.37.395	The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH).
7.37.396	PTH increases blood calcium concentrations when calcium ion levels fall below normal.
7.37.397	PTH (1) enhances reabsorption of Ca2+ by the kidneys, (2) stimulates osteoclast activity and inhibits osteoblast activity, and (3) it stimulates synthesis and secretion of calcitriol by the kidneys, which enhances Ca2+
7.37.398	absorption by the digestive system.
7.37.399	PTH is produced by chief cells of the parathyroid.
7.37.400	PTH and calcitonin work in opposition to one another to maintain homeostatic Ca2+ levels in body fluids.
7.37.401	Another type of cells, oxyphil cells, exist in the parathyroid but their function is not known.
7.37.402	These hormones encourage bone growth, muscle mass, and blood cell formation in children and women.
7.37.403	Adrenal Glands
7.37.404	The adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys; one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated in Figure 37.18.
7.37.405	The adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla.
7.37.406	These regions secrete different hormones.
7.37.407	The location of the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys is shown.
7.37.408	(credit: modification of work by NCI)
7.37.409	Adrenal Cortex
7.37.410	The adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks.
7.37.411	These layers form three distinct regions: an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids, a middle zona fasciculata that produces glucocorticoids, and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens.
7.37.412	The main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which regulates the concentration of Na+ ions in urine, sweat, pancreas, and saliva.
7.37.413	Aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a decrease in blood concentrations of sodium ions, blood volume, or blood pressure, or by an increase in blood potassium levels.
7.37.414	The three main glucocorticoids are cortisol, corticosterone, and cortisone.
7.37.415	The glucocorticoids stimulate the synthesis of glucose and gluconeogenesis (converting a non-carbohydrate to glucose) by liver cells and they promote the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue.
7.37.416	These hormones increase blood glucose levels to maintain levels within a normal range between meals.
7.37.417	These hormones are secreted in response to ACTH and levels are regulated by negative feedback.
7.37.418	Androgens are sex hormones that promote masculinity.
7.37.419	They are produced in small amounts by the adrenal cortex in both males and females.
7.37.420	They do not affect sexual characteristics and may supplement sex hormones released from the gonads.
7.37.421	Adrenal Medulla
7.37.422	The adrenal medulla contains large, irregularly shaped cells that are closely associated with blood vessels.
7.37.423	These cells are innervated by preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers from the central nervous system.
7.37.424	The adrenal medulla contains two types of secretory cells: one that produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and another that produces norepinephrine (noradrenaline).
7.37.425	Epinephrine is the primary adrenal medulla hormone accounting for 75 to 80 percent of its secretions.
7.37.426	Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase heart rate, breathing rate, cardiac muscle contractions, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels.
7.37.427	They also accelerate the breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats in adipose tissue.
7.37.428	The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous system.
7.37.429	Secretion of these hormones is stimulated by acetylcholine release from preganglionic sympathetic fibers innervating the adrenal medulla.
7.37.430	These neural impulses originate from the hypothalamus in response to stress to prepare the body for the fight-or-flight response.
7.37.431	Pancreas
7.37.432	The pancreas, illustrated in Figure 37.19, is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and the proximal portion of the small intestine.
7.37.433	It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones.
7.37.434	It is sometimes referred to as a heterocrine gland because it has both endocrine and exocrine functions.
7.37.435	The pancreas is found underneath the stomach and points toward the spleen.
7.37.436	(credit: modification of work by NCI)
7.37.437	The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans, as visible in the micrograph shown in Figure 37.20.
7.37.438	The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types: alpha cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, and beta cells, which produce the hormone insulin.
7.37.439	These hormones regulate blood glucose levels.
7.37.440	As blood glucose levels decline, alpha cells release glucagon to raise the blood glucose levels by increasing rates of glycogen breakdown and glucose release by the liver.
7.37.441	When blood glucose levels rise, such as after a meal, beta cells release insulin to lower blood glucose levels by increasing the rate of glucose uptake in most body cells, and by increasing glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles and the liver.
7.37.442	Together, glucagon and insulin regulate blood glucose levels.
7.37.443	Figure 37.20
7.37.444	The islets of Langerhans are clusters of endocrine cells found in the pancreas; they stain lighter than surrounding cells.

7.37.446	Pineal Gland
7.37.447	The pineal gland produces melatonin.
7.37.448	The rate of melatonin production is affected by the photoperiod.
7.37.449	Collaterals from the visual pathways innervate the pineal gland.
7.37.450	During the day photoperiod, little melatonin is produced; however, melatonin production increases during the dark photoperiod (night).
7.37.451	In some mammals, melatonin has an inhibitory affect on reproductive functions by decreasing production and maturation of sperm, oocytes, and reproductive organs.
7.37.452	Melatonin is an effective antioxidant, protecting the CNS from free radicals such as nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide.
7.37.453	Lastly, melatonin is involved in biological rhythms, particularly circadian rhythms such as the sleep-wake cycle and eating habits.
7.37.454	Gonads The gonads—
7.37.455	the male testes and female ovaries—produce steroid hormones.
7.37.456	The testes produce androgens, testosterone being the most prominent, which allow for the development of secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm cells.
7.37.457	The ovaries produce estradiol and progesterone, which cause secondary sex characteristics and prepare the body for childbirth.
7.37.458	Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions There are several organs whose primary functions are non-endocrine but that also possess endocrine functions.
7.37.459	These include the heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, gonads, and adipose tissue.
7.37.460	The heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells.
7.37.461	These cells release the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in response to increased blood volume.
7.37.462	High blood volume causes the cells to be stretched, resulting in hormone release.
7.37.463	ANP acts on the kidneys to reduce the reabsorption of Na+, causing Na+ and water to be excreted in the urine.
7.37.464	ANP also reduces the amounts of renin released by the kidneys and aldosterone released by the adrenal cortex, further preventing the retention of water.
7.37.465	In this way, ANP causes a reduction in blood volume and blood pressure, and reduces the concentration of Na+ in the blood.
7.37.466	The gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion.
7.37.467	The endocrine cells are located in the mucosa of the GI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine.
7.37.468	Some of the hormones produced include gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin, which are secreted in the presence of food, and some of which act on other organs such as the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver.
7.37.469	They trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the GI tract.
7.37.470	While the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands, the kidneys themselves also possess endocrine function.
7.37.471	Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone.
7.37.472	Aldosterone then causes the retention of Na+ and water, raising blood volume.
7.37.473	The kidneys also release calcitriol, which aids in the absorption of Ca2+ and phosphate ions.
7.37.474	Erythropoietin (EPO) is a protein hormone that triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow.
7.37.475	EPO is released in response to low oxygen levels.
7.37.476	Because red blood cells are oxygen carriers, increased production results in greater oxygen delivery throughout the body.
7.37.477	EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance, as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells allows for greater endurance.
7.37.478	Because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood, artificially high levels of EPO can cause severe health risks.
7.37.479	The thymus is found behind the sternum; it is most prominent in infants, becoming smaller in size through adulthood.
7.37.480	The thymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins, which contribute to the development of the immune response.
7.37.481	Adipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body.
7.37.482	It produces the hormone leptin in response to food intake.
7.37.483	Leptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons, producing a feeling of satiety after eating, thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating.
7.37.484	Leptin is also associated with reproduction.
7.37.485	It must be present for GnRH and gonadotropin synthesis to occur.
7.37.486	Extremely thin females may enter puberty late; however, if adipose levels increase, more leptin will be produced, improving fertility.     
7.38.0	Introduction
7.38.1	The muscular and skeletal systems provide support to the body and allow for a wide range of movement.
7.38.2	The bones of the skeletal system protect the body’s internal organs and support the weight of the body.
7.38.3	The muscles of the muscular system contract and pull on the bones, allowing for movements as diverse as standing, walking, running, and grasping items.
7.38.4	Injury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be very debilitating.
7.38.5	In humans, the most common musculoskeletal diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition.
7.38.6	Ailments that affect the joints are also widespread, such as arthritis, which can make movement difficult and—in advanced cases—completely impair mobility.
7.38.7	In severe cases in which the joint has suffered extensive damage, joint replacement surgery may be needed.
7.38.8	Progress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the development of artificial joints, with joint replacement surgery in the hips and knees being the most common.
7.38.9	Replacement joints for shoulders, elbows, and fingers are also available.
7.38.10	Even with this progress, there is still room for improvement in the design of prostheses.
7.38.11	The state-of-the-art prostheses have limited durability and therefore wear out quickly, particularly in young or active individuals.
7.38.12	Current research is focused on the use of new materials, such as carbon fiber, that may make prostheses more durable.
7.38.13	A skeletal system is necessary to support the body, protect internal organs, and allow for the movement of an organism.
7.38.14	There are three different skeleton designs that fulfill these functions: hydrostatic skeleton, exoskeleton, and endoskeleton.
7.38.15	Hydrostatic Skeleton
7.38.16	A hydrostatic skeleton is a skeleton formed by a fluid-filled compartment within the body, called the coelom.
7.38.17	The organs of the coelom are supported by the aqueous fluid, which also resists external compression.
7.38.18	This compartment is under hydrostatic pressure because of the fluid and supports the other organs of the organism.
7.38.19	This type of skeletal system is found in soft-bodied animals such as sea anemones, earthworms, Cnidaria, and other invertebrates (Figure 38.2).
7.38.20	The skeleton of the red-knobbed sea star (Protoreaster linckii) is an example of a hydrostatic skeleton.
7.38.21	(credit:
7.38.22	“
7.38.23	Amada44”/Wikimedia Commons) Movement in a hydrostatic skeleton is provided by muscles that surround the coelom.
7.38.24	The muscles in a hydrostatic skeleton contract to change the shape of the coelom; the pressure of the fluid in the coelom produces movement.
7.38.25	For example, earthworms move by waves of muscular contractions of the skeletal muscle of the body wall hydrostatic skeleton, called peristalsis, which alternately shorten and lengthen the body.
7.38.26	Lengthening the body extends the anterior end of the organism.
7.38.27	Most organisms have a mechanism to fix themselves in the substrate.
7.38.28	Shortening the muscles then draws the posterior portion of the body forward.
7.38.29	Although a hydrostatic skeleton is well-suited to invertebrate organisms such as earthworms and some aquatic organisms, it is not an efficient skeleton for terrestrial animals.
7.38.30	Exoskeleton An exoskeleton is an external skeleton that consists of a hard encasement on the surface of an organism.
7.38.31	For example, the shells of crabs and insects are exoskeletons (Figure 38.3).
7.38.32	This skeleton type provides defence against predators, supports the body, and allows for movement through the contraction of attached muscles.
7.38.33	As with vertebrates, muscles must cross a joint inside the exoskeleton.
7.38.34	Shortening of the muscle changes the relationship of the two segments of the exoskeleton.
7.38.35	Arthropods such as crabs and lobsters have exoskeletons that consist of 30–50 percent chitin, a polysaccharide derivative of glucose that is a strong but flexible material.
7.38.36	Chitin is secreted by the epidermal cells.
7.38.37	The exoskeleton is further strengthened by the addition of calcium carbonate in organisms such as the lobster.
7.38.38	Because the exoskeleton is acellular, arthropods must periodically shed their exoskeletons because the exoskeleton does not grow as the organism grows.
7.38.39	Muscles attached to the exoskeleton of the Halloween crab (Gecarcinus quadratus) allow it to move.
7.38.40	Endoskeleton
7.38.41	An endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard, mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms.
7.38.42	An example of a primitive endoskeletal structure is the spicules of sponges.
7.38.43	The bones of vertebrates are composed of tissues, whereas sponges have no true tissues (Figure 38.4).
7.38.44	Endoskeletons provide support for the body, protect internal organs, and allow for movement through contraction of muscles attached to the skeleton.
7.38.45	Figure 38.4
7.38.46	The skeletons of humans and horses are examples of endoskeletons.
7.38.47	(credit: Ross Murphy)
7.38.48	The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones in the adult.
7.38.49	It has five main functions: providing support to the body, storing minerals and lipids, producing blood cells, protecting internal organs, and allowing for movement.
7.38.50	The skeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage), and the appendicular skeleton (which consists of the shoulders, limb bones, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle).
7.38.51	Human Axial Skeleton
7.38.52	The axial skeleton forms the central axis of the body and includes the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear,
7.38.53	hyoid bone of the throat, vertebral column, and the thoracic cage (ribcage)
7.38.54	(Figure 38.5).
7.38.55	The function of the axial skeleton is to provide support and protection for the brain, the spinal cord, and the organs in the ventral body cavity.
7.38.56	It provides a surface for the attachment of muscles that move the head, neck, and trunk, performs respiratory movements, and stabilizes parts of the appendicular skeleton.
7.38.57	The axial skeleton consists of the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear, hyoid bone, vertebral column, and rib cage.

7.38.59	The Skull
7.38.60	The bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain.
7.38.61	The skull consists of 22 bones, which are divided into two categories: cranial bones and facial bones.
7.38.62	The cranial bones are eight bones that form the cranial cavity, which encloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for the muscles of the head and neck.
7.38.63	The eight cranial bones are the frontal bone, two parietal bones, two temporal bones, occipital bone, sphenoid bone, and the ethmoid bone.
7.38.64	Although the bones developed separately in the embryo and fetus, in the adult, they are tightly fused with connective tissue and adjoining bones do not move (Figure 38.6).
7.38.65	The bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain.
7.38.66	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.38.67	The auditory ossicles of the middle ear transmit sounds from the air as vibrations to the fluid-filled cochlea.
7.38.68	The auditory ossicles consist of six bones: two malleus bones, two incus bones, and two stapes on each side.
7.38.69	These are the smallest bones in the body and are unique to mammals.
7.38.70	Fourteen facial bones form the face, provide cavities for the sense organs (eyes, mouth, and nose), protect the entrances to the digestive and respiratory tracts, and serve as attachment points for facial muscles.
7.38.71	The 14 facial bones are the nasal bones, the maxillary bones, zygomatic bones, palatine, vomer, lacrimal bones, the inferior nasal conchae, and the mandible.
7.38.72	All of these bones occur in pairs except for the mandible and the vomer
7.38.73	(Figure 38.7).
7.38.74	The cranial bones, including the frontal, parietal, and sphenoid bones, cover the top of the head.
7.38.75	The facial bones of the skull form the face and provide cavities for the eyes, nose, and mouth.
7.38.76	Although it is not found in the skull, the hyoid bone is considered a component of the axial skeleton.
7.38.77	The hyoid bone lies below the mandible in the front of the neck.
7.38.78	It acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw, larynx, and tongue.
7.38.79	The mandible articulates with the base of the skull.
7.38.80	The mandible controls the opening to the airway and gut.
7.38.81	In animals with teeth, the mandible brings the surfaces of the teeth in contact with the maxillary teeth.
7.38.82	The Vertebral Column
7.38.83	The vertebral column, or spinal column, surrounds and protects the spinal cord, supports the head, and acts as an attachment point for the ribs and muscles of the back and neck.
7.38.84	The adult vertebral column comprises 26 bones: the 24 vertebrae, the sacrum, and the coccyx bones.
7.38.85	In the adult, the sacrum is typically composed of five vertebrae that fuse into one.
7.38.86	The coccyx is typically 3–4 vertebrae that fuse into one.
7.38.87	Around the age of 70, the sacrum and the coccyx may fuse together.
7.38.88	We begin life with approximately 33 vertebrae, but as we grow, several vertebrae fuse together.
7.38.89	The adult vertebrae are further divided into the 7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, and 5 lumbar vertebrae (Figure 38.8).
7.38.90	The vertebral column consists of seven cervical vertebrae (C1–7) twelve thoracic vertebrae (Th1–12), five lumbar vertebrae (L1–5), the os sacrum, and the coccyx.
7.38.91	(b)
7.38.92	Spinal curves increase the strength and flexibility of the spine.
7.38.93	(credit a: modification of work by Uwe Gille based on original work by Gray's Anatomy; credit b: modification of work by NCI, NIH)
7.38.94	Each vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of the spinal cord pass.
7.38.95	There is also a notch on each side through which the spinal nerves, which serve the body at that level, can exit from the spinal cord.
7.38.96	The vertebral column is approximately 71 cm (28 inches) in adult male humans and is curved, which can be seen from a side view.
7.38.97	The names of the spinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which they occur.
7.38.98	The thoracic and sacral curves are concave (curve inwards relative to the front of the body) and the cervical and lumbar curves are convex (curve outwards relative to the front of the body).
7.38.99	The arched curvature of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility, allowing it to absorb shocks like a spring (Figure 38.8).
7.38.100	Intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum.
7.38.101	Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running.
7.38.102	Intervertebral discs also act as ligaments to bind vertebrae together.
7.38.103	The inner part of discs, the nucleus pulposus, hardens as people age and becomes less elastic.
7.38.104	This loss of elasticity diminishes its ability to absorb shocks.
7.38.105	The Thoracic Cage
7.38.106	The thoracic cage, also known as the ribcage, is the skeleton of the chest, and consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic vertebrae, and costal cartilages (Figure 38.9).
7.38.107	The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity, including the heart and lungs.
7.38.108	It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs, and serves as the attachment point for the diaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders.
7.38.109	Changes in the volume of the thorax enable breathing.
7.38.110	The sternum, or breastbone, is a long, flat bone located at the anterior of the chest.
7.38.111	It is formed from three bones that fuse in the adult.
7.38.112	The ribs are 12 pairs of long, curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body, forming the ribcage.
7.38.113	Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum, with the exception of rib pairs 11 and 12, which are free-floating ribs.
7.38.114	The thoracic cage, or rib cage, protects the heart and the lungs.
7.38.115	(credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH)
7.38.116	Human Appendicular Skeleton
7.38.117	The appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the upper limbs (which function to grasp and manipulate objects) and the lower limbs (which permit locomotion).
7.38.118	It also includes the pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, that attaches the upper limbs to the body, and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower limbs to the body (Figure 38.10).
7.38.119	The appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the pectoral limbs (arm, forearm, hand), the pelvic limbs (thigh, leg, foot), the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle.
7.38.120	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.38.121	The Pectoral Girdle
7.38.122	The pectoral girdle bones provide the points of attachment of the upper limbs to the axial skeleton.
7.38.123	The human pectoral girdle consists of the clavicle (or collarbone) in the anterior, and the scapula (or shoulder blades) in the posterior (Figure 38.11).
7.38.124	Figure 38.11 (a) The pectoral girdle in primates consists of the clavicles and scapulae.
7.38.125	(b)
7.38.126	The posterior view reveals the spine of the scapula to which muscle attaches.
7.38.127	The clavicles are S-shaped bones that position the arms on the body.
7.38.128	The clavicles lie horizontally across the front of the thorax (chest) just above the first rib.
7.38.129	These bones are fairly fragile and are susceptible to fractures.
7.38.130	For example, a fall with the arms outstretched causes the force to be transmitted to the clavicles, which can break if the force is excessive.
7.38.131	The clavicle articulates with the sternum and the scapula.
7.38.132	The scapulae are flat, triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle.
7.38.133	They support the muscles crossing the shoulder joint.
7.38.134	A ridge, called the spine, runs across the back of the scapula and can easily be felt through the skin (Figure 38.11).
7.38.135	The spine of the scapula is a good example of a bony protrusion that facilitates a broad area of attachment for muscles to bone.
7.38.136	The Upper Limb
7.38.137	The upper limb contains 30 bones in three regions: the arm (shoulder to elbow), the forearm (ulna and radius), and the wrist and hand (Figure 38.12).
7.38.138	The upper limb consists of the humerus of the upper arm, the radius and ulna of the forearm, eight bones of the carpus, five bones of the metacarpus, and 14 bones of the phalanges.
7.38.139	An articulation is any place at which two bones are joined.
7.38.140	The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb and the only bone of the arm.
7.38.141	It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow.
7.38.142	The forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones: the ulna and the radius.
7.38.143	The radius is located along the lateral (thumb) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow.
7.38.144	The ulna is located on the medial aspect (pinky-finger side) of the forearm.
7.38.145	It is longer than the radius.
7.38.146	The ulna articulates with the humerus at the elbow.
7.38.147	The radius and ulna also articulate with the carpal bones and with each other, which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation of the carpus with respect to the long axis of the limb.
7.38.148	The hand includes the eight bones of the carpus (wrist), the five bones of the metacarpus (palm), and the 14 bones of the phalanges (digits).
7.38.149	Each digit consists of three phalanges, except for the thumb, when present, which has only two.
7.38.150	The Pelvic Girdle
7.38.151	The pelvic girdle attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton.
7.38.152	Because it is responsible for bearing the weight of the body and for locomotion, the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong ligaments.
7.38.153	It also has deep sockets with robust ligaments to securely attach the femur to the body.
7.38.154	The pelvic girdle is further strengthened by two large hip bones.
7.38.155	In adults, the hip bones, or coxal bones, are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones: the ilium, ischium, and pubis.
7.38.156	The pelvis joins together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior of the body.
7.38.157	The female pelvis is slightly different from the male pelvis.
7.38.158	Over generations of evolution, females with a wider pubic angle and larger diameter pelvic canal reproduced more successfully.
7.38.159	Therefore, their offspring also had pelvic anatomy that enabled successful childbirth (Figure 38.13).
7.38.160	o adapt to reproductive fitness, the (a) female pelvis is lighter, wider, shallower, and has a broader angle between the pubic bones than (b) the male pelvis.
7.38.161	The Lower Limb
7.38.162	The lower limb consists of the thigh, the leg, and the foot.
7.38.163	The bones of the lower limb are the femur (thigh bone), patella (kneecap), tibia and fibula (bones of the leg), tarsals (bones of the ankle), and metatarsals and phalanges (bones of the foot) (Figure 38.14).
7.38.164	The bones of the lower limbs are thicker and stronger than the bones of the upper limbs because of the need to support the entire weight of the body and the resulting forces from locomotion.
7.38.165	In addition to evolutionary fitness, the bones of an individual will respond to forces exerted upon them.
7.38.166	he lower limb consists of the thigh (femur), kneecap (patella), leg (tibia and fibula), ankle (tarsals), and foot (metatarsals and phalanges) bones.
7.38.167	The femur, or thighbone, is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the body.
7.38.168	The femur and pelvis form the hip joint at the proximal end.
7.38.169	At the distal end, the femur, tibia, and patella form the knee joint.
7.38.170	The patella, or kneecap, is a triangular bone that lies anterior to the knee joint.
7.38.171	The patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors (quadriceps).
7.38.172	It improves knee extension by reducing friction.
7.38.173	The tibia, or shinbone, is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee.
7.38.174	The tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end, with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end.
7.38.175	It is the second largest bone in the human body and is responsible for transmitting the weight of the body from the femur to the foot.
7.38.176	The fibula, or calf bone, parallels and articulates with the tibia.
7.38.177	It does not articulate with the femur and does not bear weight.
7.38.178	The fibula acts as a site for muscle attachment and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.
7.38.179	The tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle.
7.38.180	The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot.
7.38.181	The metatarsals are the five bones of the foot.
7.38.182	The phalanges are the 14 bones of the toes.
7.38.183	Each toe consists of three phalanges, except for the big toe that has only two (Figure 38.15).
7.38.184	Variations exist in other species; for example, the horse’s metacarpals and metatarsals are oriented vertically and do not make contact with the substrate.
7.38.185	Bone, or osseous tissue, is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton.
7.38.186	It contains specialized cells and a matrix of mineral salts and collagen fibers.
7.38.187	The mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite, a mineral formed from calcium phosphate.
7.38.188	Calcification is the process of deposition of mineral salts on the collagen fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue.
7.38.189	The process of calcification only occurs in the presence of collagen fibers.
7.38.190	The bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape: long bones, short bones, flat bones, sutural bones, sesamoid bones, and irregular bones (Figure 38.16).
7.38.191	Shown are different types of bones: flat, irregular, long, short, and sesamoid.
7.38.192	Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends.
7.38.193	The diaphysis, or central shaft, contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity.
7.38.194	The rounded ends, the epiphyses, are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow, which produces blood cells (Figure 38.17).
7.38.195	Most of the limb bones are long bones—for example, the femur, tibia, ulna, and radius.
7.38.196	Exceptions to this include the patella and the bones of the wrist and ankle.
7.38.197	The long bone is covered by articular cartilage at either end and contains bone marrow (shown in yellow in this illustration) in the marrow cavity.
7.38.198	Short bones, or cuboidal bones, are bones that are the same width and length, giving them a cube-like shape.
7.38.199	For example, the bones of the wrist (carpals) and ankle (tarsals) are short bones (Figure 38.16).
7.38.200	Flat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required.
7.38.201	Examples of flat bones are the sternum (breast bone), ribs, scapulae (shoulder blades), and the roof of the skull (Figure 38.16).
7.38.202	Irregular bones are bones with complex shapes.
7.38.203	These bones may have short, flat, notched, or ridged surfaces.
7.38.204	Examples of irregular bones are the vertebrae, hip bones, and several skull bones.
7.38.205	Sesamoid bones are small, flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed.
7.38.206	The patellae are sesamoid bones (Figure 38.18).
7.38.207	Sesamoid bones develop inside tendons and may be found near joints at the knees, hands, and feet.
7.38.208	The patella of the knee is an example of a sesamoid bone.
7.38.209	Sutural bones are small, flat, irregularly shaped bones.
7.38.210	They may be found between the flat bones of the skull.
7.38.211	They vary in number, shape, size, and position.
7.38.212	Bone Tissue Bones are considered organs because they contain various types of tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone tissue.
7.38.213	Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral matrix of bones.
7.38.214	There are two types of bone tissue: compact and spongy.
7.38.215	Compact Bone Tissue Compact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone marrow.
7.38.216	It provides protection and strength to bones.
7.38.217	Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems.
7.38.218	Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport blood.
7.38.219	They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone.
7.38.220	Each osteon consists of lamellae, which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal.
7.38.221	The Haversian canal (osteonic canal) contains the bone’s blood vessels and nerve fibers (Figure 38.19).
7.38.222	Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing.
7.38.223	Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at which stresses are applied in only a few directions.
7.38.224	Spongy Bone Tissue
7.38.225	Whereas compact bone tissue forms
7.38.226	the outer layer of all bones, spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones.
7.38.227	Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue.
7.38.228	Instead, it consists of trabeculae, which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates.
7.38.229	Red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae.
7.38.230	Blood vessels within this tissue deliver nutrients to osteocytes and remove waste.
7.38.231	The red bone marrow of the femur and the interior of other large bones, such as the ileum, forms blood cells.
7.38.232	Spongy bone reduces the density of bone and allows the ends of long bones to compress as the result of stresses applied to the bone.
7.38.233	Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not heavily stressed or where stresses arrive from many directions.
7.38.234	The epiphyses of bones, such as the neck of the femur, are subject to stress from many directions.
7.38.235	Imagine laying a heavy framed picture flat on the floor.
7.38.236	You could hold up one side of the picture with a toothpick if the toothpick was perpendicular to the floor and the picture.
7.38.237	Now drill a hole and stick the toothpick into the wall to hang up the picture.
7.38.238	In this case, the function of the toothpick is to transmit the downward pressure of the picture to the wall.
7.38.239	The force on the picture is straight down to the floor, but the force on the toothpick is both the picture wire pulling down and the bottom of the hole in the wall pushing up.
7.38.240	The toothpick will break off right at the wall.
7.38.241	The neck of the femur is horizontal like the toothpick in the wall.
7.38.242	The weight of the body pushes it down near the joint, but the vertical diaphysis of the femur pushes it up at the other end.
7.38.243	The neck of the femur must be strong enough to transfer the downward force of the body weight horizontally to the vertical shaft of the femur (Figure 38.20).
7.38.244	Cell Types in Bones Bone consists of four types of cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and osteoprogenitor cells.
7.38.245	Osteoblasts are bone cells that are responsible for bone formation.
7.38.246	Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular matrix of bone tissue, and collagen fibers.
7.38.247	Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes.
7.38.248	Osteoclasts are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei.
7.38.249	They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix.
7.38.250	These minerals, released from bones into the blood, help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids.
7.38.251	Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling, if the applied stresses have changed.
7.38.252	Osteocytes are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue; these cells cannot divide.
7.38.253	Osteocytes maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix.
7.38.254	Osteoprogenitor cells are squamous stem cells that divide to produce daughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts.
7.38.255	Osteoprogenitor cells are important in the repair of fractures.
7.38.256	Development of Bone Ossification, or osteogenesis, is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts.
7.38.257	Ossification is distinct from the process of calcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues.
7.38.258	Ossification begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo.
7.38.259	Before this time, the embryonic skeleton consists entirely of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage.
7.38.260	The development of bone from fibrous membranes is called intramembranous ossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification.
7.38.261	Bone growth continues until approximately age 25.
7.38.262	Bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions primarily in bone remodeling and repair.
7.38.263	Intramembranous Ossification Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes.
7.38.264	It is involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles.
7.38.265	Ossification begins as mesenchymal cells form a template of the future bone.
7.38.266	They then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center.
7.38.267	Osteoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix and deposit calcium, which hardens the matrix.
7.38.268	The non-mineralized portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form around blood vessels, forming spongy bone.
7.38.269	Connective tissue in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus.
7.38.270	The spongy bone is remodeled into a thin layer of compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone.
7.38.271	Endochondral Ossification Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage.
7.38.272	All of the bones of the body, except for the flat bones of the skull, mandible, and clavicles, are formed through endochondral ossification.
7.38.273	In long bones, chondrocytes form a template of the hyaline cartilage diaphysis.
7.38.274	Responding to complex developmental signals, the matrix begins to calcify.
7.38.275	This calcification prevents diffusion of nutrients into the matrix, resulting in chondrocytes dying and the opening up of cavities in the diaphysis cartilage.
7.38.276	Blood vessels invade the cavities, and osteoblasts and osteoclasts modify the calcified cartilage matrix into spongy bone.
7.38.277	Osteoclasts then break down some of the spongy bone to create a marrow, or medullary, cavity in the center of the diaphysis.
7.38.278	Dense, irregular connective tissue forms a sheath (periosteum) around the bones.
7.38.279	The periosteum assists in attaching the bone to surrounding tissues, tendons, and ligaments.
7.38.280	The bone continues to grow and elongate as the cartilage cells at the epiphyses divide.
7.38.281	In the last stage of prenatal bone development, the centers of the epiphyses begin to calcify.
7.38.282	Secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone.
7.38.283	Until adolescence, hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate (growth plate), which is the region between the diaphysis and epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones (Figure 38.21).
7.38.284	Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage.
7.38.285	The periosteum is the connective tissue on the outside of bone that acts as the interface between bone, blood vessels, tendons, and ligaments.
7.38.286	Growth of Bone Long bones continue to lengthen, potentially until adolescence, through the addition of bone tissue at the epiphyseal plate.
7.38.287	They also increase in width through appositional growth.
7.38.288	Lengthening of Long Bones Chondrocytes on the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate divide; one cell remains undifferentiated near the epiphysis, and one cell moves toward the diaphysis.
7.38.289	The cells, which are pushed from the epiphysis, mature and are destroyed by calcification.
7.38.290	This process replaces cartilage with bone on the diaphyseal side of the plate, resulting in a lengthening of the bone.
7.38.291	Long bones stop growing at around the age of 18 in females and the age of 21 in males in a process called epiphyseal plate closure.
7.38.292	During this process, cartilage cells stop dividing and all of the cartilage is replaced by bone.
7.38.293	The epiphyseal plate fades, leaving a structure called the epiphyseal line or epiphyseal remnant, and the epiphysis and diaphysis fuse.
7.38.294	Thickening of Long Bones
7.38.295	Appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones.
7.38.296	Osteoblasts at the bone surface secrete bone matrix, and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down bone.
7.38.297	The osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes.
7.38.298	A balance between these two processes allows the bone to thicken without becoming too heavy.
7.38.299	Bone Remodeling and Repair Bone renewal continues after birth into adulthood.
7.38.300	Bone remodeling is the replacement of old bone tissue by new bone tissue.
7.38.301	It involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts.
7.38.302	Normal bone growth requires vitamins D, C, and A, plus minerals such as calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium.
7.38.303	Hormones such as parathyroid hormone, growth hormone, and calcitonin are also required for proper bone growth and maintenance.
7.38.304	Bone turnover rates are quite high, with five to seven percent of bone mass being recycled every week.
7.38.305	Differences in turnover rate exist in different areas of the skeleton and in different areas of a bone.
7.38.306	For example, the bone in the head of the femur may be fully replaced every six months, whereas the bone along the shaft is altered much more slowly.
7.38.307	Bone remodeling allows bones to adapt to stresses by becoming thicker and stronger when subjected to stress.
7.38.308	Bones that are not subject to normal stress, for example when a limb is in a cast, will begin to lose mass.
7.38.309	A fractured or broken bone undergoes repair through four stages: 1.
7.38.310	Blood vessels in the broken bone tear and hemorrhage, resulting in the formation of clotted blood, or a hematoma, at the site of the break.
7.38.311	The severed blood vessels at the broken ends of the bone are sealed by the clotting process, and bone cells that are deprived of nutrients begin to die.
7.38.312	2.
7.38.313	Within days of the fracture, capillaries grow into the hematoma, and phagocytic cells begin to clear away the dead cells.
7.38.314	Though fragments of the blood clot may remain, fibroblasts and osteoblasts enter the area and begin to reform bone.
7.38.315	Fibroblasts produce collagen fibers that connect the broken bone ends, and osteoblasts start to form spongy bone.
7.38.316	The repair tissue between the broken bone ends is called the fibrocartilaginous callus, as it is composed of both hyaline and fibrocartilage (Figure 38.22).
7.38.317	Some bone spicules may also appear at this point.
7.38.318	3.
7.38.319	The fibrocartilaginous callus is converted into a bony callus of spongy bone.
7.38.320	It takes about two months for the broken bone ends to be firmly joined together after the fracture.
7.38.321	This is similar to the endochondral formation of bone, as cartilage becomes ossified; osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone matrix are present.
7.38.322	4.
7.38.323	The bony callus is then remodelled by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, with excess material on the exterior of the bone and within the medullary cavity being removed.
7.38.324	Compact bone is added to create bone tissue that is similar to the original, unbroken bone.
7.38.325	This remodeling can take many months, and the bone may remain uneven for years.
7.38.326	After this bone is set, a callus will knit the two ends together.
7.38.327	(credit: Bill Rhodes)
7.38.328	The point at which two or more bones meet is called a joint, or articulation.
7.38.329	Joints are responsible for movement, such as the movement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull.
7.38.330	Classification of Joints on the Basis of Structure
7.38.331	There are two ways to classify joints: on the basis of their structure or on the basis of their function.
7.38.332	The structural classification divides joints into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing the joint and the presence or absence of a cavity in the joint.
7.38.333	Fibrous Joints
7.38.334	The bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue.
7.38.335	There is no cavity, or space, present between the bones and so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements.
7.38.336	There are three types of fibrous joints: sutures, syndesmoses, and gomphoses.
7.38.337	Sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place (Figure 38.23).
7.38.338	Sutures are fibrous joints found only in the skull.
7.38.339	Syndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue, allowing for more movement than in a suture.
7.38.340	An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle.
7.38.341	The amount of movement in these types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers.
7.38.342	Gomphoses occur between teeth and their sockets; the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg (Figure 38.24).
7.38.343	The tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal ligament.
7.38.344	Gomphoses are fibrous joints between the teeth and their sockets.
7.38.345	(credit: modification of work by Gray's Anatomy)
7.38.346	Cartilaginous Joints Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage.
7.38.347	There are two types of cartilaginous joints: synchondroses and symphyses.
7.38.348	In a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage.
7.38.349	Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children.
7.38.350	In symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage.
7.38.351	Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae.
7.38.352	Either type of cartilaginous joint allows for very little movement.
7.38.353	Synovial Joints Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones (Figure 38.25).
7.38.354	This space is referred to as the synovial (or joint) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid.
7.38.355	Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement.
7.38.356	The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage, and the entire joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue that allows movement of the joint while resisting dislocation.
7.38.357	Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together.
7.38.358	Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint.
7.38.359	Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints.
7.38.360	Classification of Joints on the Basis of Function
7.38.361	The functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses.
7.38.362	A synarthrosis is a joint that is immovable.
7.38.363	This includes sutures, gomphoses, and synchondroses.
7.38.364	Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement, including syndesmoses and symphyses.
7.38.365	Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint, as in synovial joints.
7.38.366	Movement at Synovial Joints
7.38.367	The wide range of movement allowed by synovial joints produces different types of movements.
7.38.368	The movement of synovial joints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement.
7.38.369	Gliding Movement Gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other.
7.38.370	Gliding movements produce very little rotation or angular movement of the bones.
7.38.371	The joints of the carpal and tarsal bones are examples of joints that produce gliding movements.
7.38.372	Angular Movement Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes.
7.38.373	There are several different types of angular movements, including flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction.
7.38.374	Flexion, or bending, occurs when the angle between the bones decreases.
7.38.375	Moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion.
7.38.376	Extension is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between the bones of a joint increases.
7.38.377	Straightening a limb after flexion is an example of extension.
7.38.378	Extension past the regular anatomical position is referred to as hyperextension.
7.38.379	This includes moving the neck back to look upward, or bending the wrist so that the hand moves away from the forearm.
7.38.380	Abduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body.
7.38.381	Examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side.
7.38.382	Adduction is the movement of a bone toward the midline of the body.
7.38.383	Movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction.
7.38.384	Circumduction is the movement of a limb in a circular motion, as in moving the arm in a circular motion.
7.38.385	Rotational Movement Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis.
7.38.386	Rotation can be toward the midline of the body, which is referred to as medial rotation, or away from the midline of the body, which is referred to as lateral rotation.
7.38.387	Movement of the head from side to side is an example of rotation.
7.38.388	Special Movements
7.38.389	Some movements that cannot be classified as gliding, angular, or rotational are called special movements.
7.38.390	Inversion involves the soles of the feet moving inward, toward the midline of the body.
7.38.391	Eversion is the opposite of inversion, movement of the sole of the foot outward, away from the midline of the body.
7.38.392	Protraction is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane.
7.38.393	Retraction occurs as a joint moves back into position after protraction.
7.38.394	Protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards.
7.38.395	Elevation is the movement of a bone upward, such as when the shoulders are shrugged, lifting the scapulae.
7.38.396	Depression is the opposite of elevation—movement downward of a bone, such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position.
7.38.397	Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee.
7.38.398	Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted, such as when standing on the toes.
7.38.399	Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward.
7.38.400	Pronation is the opposite movement, in which the palm faces backward.
7.38.401	Opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand, making it possible to grasp and hold objects.
7.38.402	Types of Synovial Joints Synovial joints are further classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint.
7.38.403	The shape of the joint affects the type of movement permitted by the joint (Figure 38.26).
7.38.404	These joints can be described as planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, or ball-and-socket joints.
7.38.405	Different types of joints allow different types of movement.
7.38.406	Planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket are all types of synovial joints.
7.38.407	Planar Joints Planar joints have bones with articulating surfaces that are flat or slightly curved faces.
7.38.408	These joints allow for gliding movements, and so the joints are sometimes referred to as gliding joints.
7.38.409	The range of motion is limited in these joints and does not involve rotation.
7.38.410	Planar joints are found in the carpal bones in the hand and the tarsal bones of the foot, as well as between vertebrae (Figure 38.27).
7.38.411	The joints of the carpal bones in the wrist are examples of planar joints.
7.38.412	(credit: modification of work by Brian C. Goss) Hinge Joints
7.38.413	In hinge joints, the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone.
7.38.414	In this way, one bone moves while the other remains stationary, like the hinge of a door.
7.38.415	The elbow is an example of a hinge joint.
7.38.416	The knee is sometimes classified as a modified hinge joint (Figure 38.28).
7.38.417	The elbow joint, where the radius articulates with the humerus, is an example of a hinge joint.
7.38.418	(credit: modification of work by Brian C. Goss)
7.38.419	Pivot Joints Pivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone.
7.38.420	This structure allows rotational movement, as the rounded bone moves around its own axis.
7.38.421	An example of a pivot joint is the joint of the first and second vertebrae of the neck that allows the head to move back and forth (Figure 38.29).
7.38.422	The joint of the wrist that allows the palm of the hand to be turned up and down is also a pivot joint.
7.38.423	The joint in the neck that allows the head to move back and forth is an example of a pivot joint.
7.38.424	Condyloid Joints Condyloid joints consist of an oval-shaped end of one bone fitting into a similarly oval-shaped hollow of another bone (Figure 38.30).
7.38.425	This is also sometimes called an ellipsoidal joint.
7.38.426	This type of joint allows angular movement along two axes, as seen in the joints of the wrist and fingers, which can move both side to side and up and down.
7.38.427	The metacarpophalangeal joints in the finger are examples of condyloid joints.
7.38.428	(credit: modification of work by Gray's Anatomy)
7.38.429	Saddle Joints Saddle joints are so named because the ends of each bone resemble a saddle, with concave and convex portions that fit together.
7.38.430	Saddle joints allow angular movements similar to condyloid joints but with a greater range of motion.
7.38.431	An example of a saddle joint is the thumb joint, which can move back and forth and up and down, but more freely than the wrist or fingers (Figure 38.31).
7.38.432	The carpometacarpal joints in the thumb are examples of saddle joints.
7.38.433	(credit: modification of work by Brian C. Goss)
7.38.434	Ball-and-Socket Joints Ball-and-socket joints possess a rounded, ball-like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone.
7.38.435	This organization allows the greatest range of motion, as all movement types are possible in all directions.
7.38.436	Examples of ball-and- socket joints are the shoulder and hip joints (Figure 38.32).
7.38.437	The shoulder joint is an example of a ball-and-socket joint.
7.38.438	Muscle cells are specialized for contraction.
7.38.439	Muscles allow for motions such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily processes such as respiration and digestion.
7.38.440	The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle (Figure 38.33).
7.38.441	The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle, visualized here using light microscopy.
7.38.442	Smooth muscle cells are short, tapered at each end, and have only one plump nucleus in each.
7.38.443	Cardiac muscle cells are branched and striated, but short.
7.38.444	The cytoplasm may branch, and they have one nucleus in the center of the cell.
7.38.445	(credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.38.446	Skeletal muscle tissue forms skeletal muscles, which attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement that can be consciously controlled.
7.38.447	Because it can be controlled by thought, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle.
7.38.448	Skeletal muscles are long and cylindrical in appearance; when viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has a striped or striated appearance.
7.38.449	The striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins (actin and myosin).
7.38.450	Actin is a globular contractile protein that interacts with myosin for muscle contraction.
7.38.451	Skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei present in a single cell.
7.38.452	Smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels.
7.38.453	Smooth muscle has no striations, is not under voluntary control, has only one nucleus per cell, is tapered at both ends, and is called involuntary muscle.
7.38.454	Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart, and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain blood pressure.
7.38.455	Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be consciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle.
7.38.456	It has one nucleus per cell, is branched, and is distinguished by the presence of intercalated disks.
7.38.457	Skeletal Muscle Fiber Structure
7.38.458	Each skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell.
7.38.459	These cells are incredibly large, with diameters of up to 100 μm and lengths of up to 30 cm.
7.38.460	The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma.
7.38.461	The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction, which triggers muscle contraction.
7.38.462	Within each muscle fiber are myofibrils—long cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber.
7.38.463	Myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber, and because they are only approximately 1.2 μm in diameter, hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber.
7.38.464	They attach to the sarcolemma at their ends, so that as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell contracts (Figure 38.34).
7.38.465	A skeletal muscle cell is surrounded by a plasma membrane called the sarcolemma with a cytoplasm called the sarcoplasm.
7.38.466	A muscle fiber is composed of many fibrils, packaged into orderly units.
7.38.467	The striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of repeating bands of the proteins actin and myosin that are present along the length of myofibrils.
7.38.468	Dark A bands and light I bands repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of myofibrils in the cell causes the entire cell to appear striated or banded.
7.38.469	Each I band has a dense line running vertically through the middle called a Z disc or Z line.
7.38.470	The Z discs mark the border of units called sarcomeres, which are the functional units of skeletal muscle.
7.38.471	One sarcomere is the space between two consecutive Z discs and contains one entire A band and two halves of an I band, one on either side of the A band.
7.38.472	A myofibril is composed of many sarcomeres running along its length, and as the sarcomeres individually contract, the myofibrils and muscle cells shorten (Figure 38.35).
7.38.473	A sarcomere is the region from one Z line to the next Z line.
7.38.474	Many sarcomeres are present in a myofibril, resulting in the striation pattern characteristic of skeletal muscle.
7.38.475	Myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments.
7.38.476	There are two main types of filaments: thick filaments and thin filaments; each has different compositions and locations.
7.38.477	Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril.
7.38.478	Thin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha-actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and partway into the A band.
7.38.479	The region at which thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance, as there is little space between the filaments.
7.38.480	Thin filaments do not extend all the way into the A bands, leaving a central region of the A band that only contains thick filaments.
7.38.481	This central region of the A band looks slightly lighter than the rest of the A band and is called the H zone.
7.38.482	The middle of the H zone has a vertical line called the M line, at which accessory proteins hold together thick filaments.
7.38.483	Both the Z disc and the M line hold myofilaments in place to maintain the structural arrangement and layering of the myofibril.
7.38.484	Myofibrils are connected to each other by intermediate, or desmin, filaments that attach to the Z disc.
7.38.485	Thick and thin filaments are themselves composed of proteins.
7.38.486	Thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin.
7.38.487	The tail of a myosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the central region of a thick filament near the M line, whereas the heads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin filaments overlap.
7.38.488	The primary component of thin filaments is the actin protein.
7.38.489	Two other components of the thin filament are tropomyosin and troponin.
7.38.490	Actin has binding sites for myosin attachment.
7.38.491	Strands of tropomyosin block the binding sites and prevent actin–myosin interactions when the muscles are at rest.
7.38.492	Troponin consists of three globular subunits.
7.38.493	One subunit binds to tropomyosin, one subunit binds to actin, and one subunit binds Ca2+ ions.
7.38.494	Sliding Filament Model of Contraction For a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten.
7.38.495	However, thick and thin filaments—the components of sarcomeres—do not shorten.
7.38.496	Instead, they slide by one another, causing the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain the same length.
7.38.497	The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to fit the differences observed in the named bands on the sarcomere at different degrees of muscle contraction and relaxation.
7.38.498	The mechanism of contraction is the binding of myosin to actin, forming cross-bridges that generate filament movement (Figure 38.36).
7.38.499	When (a) a sarcomere (b) contracts, the Z lines move closer together and the I band gets smaller.
7.38.500	The A band stays the same width and, at full contraction, the thin filaments overlap.
7.38.501	When a sarcomere shortens, some regions shorten whereas others stay the same length.
7.38.502	A sarcomere is defined as the distance between two consecutive Z discs or Z lines; when a muscle contracts, the distance between the Z discs is reduced.
7.38.503	The H zone—the central region of the A zone—contains only thick filaments and is shortened during contraction.
7.38.504	The I band contains only thin filaments and also shortens.
7.38.505	The A band does not shorten
7.38.506	—it remains the same length
7.38.507	—
7.38.508	but A bands of different sarcomeres move closer together during contraction, eventually disappearing.
7.38.509	Thin filaments are pulled by the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere until the Z discs approach the thick filaments.
7.38.510	The zone of overlap, in which thin filaments and thick filaments occupy the same area, increases as the thin filaments move inward.
7.38.511	ATP and Muscle Contraction
7.38.512	The motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards.
7.38.513	This action requires energy, which is provided by ATP.
7.38.514	Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein.
7.38.515	Myosin has another binding site for ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and energy.
7.38.516	ATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other.
7.38.517	After this happens, the newly bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, Pi.
7.38.518	The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called ATPase.
7.38.519	The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a “cocked” position.
7.38.520	The myosin head is then in a position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but ADP and Pi are still attached.
7.38.521	If actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed, but still attached.
7.38.522	If the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the actin and myosin molecules.
7.38.523	Pi is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a conformational change.
7.38.524	The myosin head moves toward the M line, pulling the actin along with it.
7.38.525	As the actin is pulled, the filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the M line.
7.38.526	This movement is called the power stroke, as it is the step at which force is produced.
7.38.527	As the actin is pulled toward the M line, the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts.
7.38.528	When the myosin head is “cocked,” it contains energy and is in a high-energy configuration.
7.38.529	This energy is expended as the myosin head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position.
7.38.530	After the power stroke, ADP is released; however, the cross-bridge formed is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound together.
7.38.531	ATP can then attach to myosin, which allows the cross-bridge cycle to start again and further muscle contraction can occur (Figure 38.37).
7.38.532	Regulatory Proteins
7.38.533	When a muscle is in a resting state, actin and myosin are separated.
7.38.534	To keep actin from binding to the active site on myosin, regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites.
7.38.535	Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules, preventing cross-bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input.
7.38.536	Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule; it also binds calcium ions.
7.38.537	To enable a muscle contraction, tropomyosin must change conformation, uncovering the myosin-binding site on an actin molecule and allowing cross-bridge formation.
7.38.538	This can only happen in the presence of calcium, which is kept at extremely low concentrations in the sarcoplasm.
7.38.539	If present, calcium ions bind to troponin, causing conformational changes in troponin that allow tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding sites on actin.
7.38.540	Once the tropomyosin is removed, a cross- bridge can form between actin and myosin, triggering contraction.
7.38.541	Cross-bridge cycling continues until Ca2+ ions and ATP are no longer available and tropomyosin again covers the binding sites on actin.
7.38.542	Excitation–Contraction Coupling Excitation–contraction coupling is the link (transduction) between the action potential generated in the sarcolemma and the start of a muscle contraction.
7.38.543	The trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural signal.
7.38.544	Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the muscle.
7.38.545	The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called the motor end plate.
7.38.546	The end of the neuron’s axon is called the synaptic terminal, and it does not actually contact the motor end plate.
7.38.547	A small space called the synaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate.
7.38.548	Electrical signals travel along the neuron’s axon, which branches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.
7.38.549	The ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical gradient across their cell membranes.
7.38.550	This charge gradient is carried by ions, which are differentially distributed across the membrane.
7.38.551	Each ion exerts an electrical influence and a concentration influence.
7.38.552	Just as milk will eventually mix with coffee without the need to stir, ions also distribute themselves evenly, if they are permitted to do so.
7.38.553	In this case, they are not permitted to return to an evenly mixed state.
7.38.554	The sodium–potassium ATPase uses cellular energy to move K+ ions inside the cell and Na+ ions outside.
7.38.555	This alone accumulates a small electrical charge, but a big concentration gradient.
7.38.556	There is lots of K+ in the cell and lots of Na+ outside the cell.
7.38.557	Potassium is able to leave the cell through K+ channels that are open 90% of the time, and it does.
7.38.558	However, Na+ channels are rarely open, so Na+ remains outside the cell.
7.38.559	When K+ leaves the cell, obeying its concentration gradient, that effectively leaves a negative charge behind.
7.38.560	So at rest, there is a large concentration gradient for Na+ to enter the cell, and there is an accumulation of negative charges left behind in the cell.
7.38.561	This is the resting membrane potential.
7.38.562	Potential in this context means a separation of electrical charge that is capable of doing work.
7.38.563	It is measured in volts, just like a battery.
7.38.564	However, the transmembrane potential is considerably smaller (0.07 V); therefore, the small value is expressed as millivolts (mV) or 70 mV. Because the inside of a cell is negative compared with the outside, a minus sign signifies the excess of negative charges inside the cell, −70 mV.
7.38.565	If an event changes the permeability of the membrane to Na+ ions, they will enter the cell.
7.38.566	That will change the voltage.
7.38.567	This is an electrical event, called an action potential, that can be used as a cellular signal.
7.38.568	Communication occurs between nerves and muscles through neurotransmitters.
7.38.569	Neuron action potentials cause the release of neurotransmitters from the synaptic terminal into the synaptic cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the motor end plate.
7.38.570	The motor end plate possesses junctional folds—folds in the sarcolemma that create a large surface area for the neurotransmitter to bind to receptors.
7.38.571	The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to allow the passage of Na+ into the cell when they receive neurotransmitter signal.
7.38.572	Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released by motor neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate.
7.38.573	Neurotransmitter release occurs when an action potential travels down the motor neuron’s axon, resulting in altered permeability of the synaptic terminal membrane and an influx of calcium.
7.38.574	The Ca2+ ions allow synaptic vesicles to move to and bind with the presynaptic membrane (on the neuron), and release neurotransmitter from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft.
7.38.575	Once released by the synaptic terminal, ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the motor end plate, where it binds with ACh receptors.
7.38.576	As a neurotransmitter binds, these ion channels open, and Na+ ions cross the membrane into the muscle cell.
7.38.577	This reduces the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell, which is called depolarization.
7.38.578	As ACh binds at the motor end plate, this depolarization is called an end-plate potential.
7.38.579	The depolarization then spreads along the sarcolemma, creating an action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial depolarization site sense the change in voltage and open.
7.38.580	The action potential moves across the entire cell, creating a wave of depolarization.
7.38.581	ACh is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) into acetyl and choline.
7.38.582	AChE resides in the synaptic cleft, breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors, which would cause unwanted extended muscle contraction (Figure 38.38).
7.38.583	After depolarization, the membrane returns to its resting state.
7.38.584	This is called repolarization, during which voltage- gated sodium channels close.
7.38.585	Potassium channels continue at 90% conductance.
7.38.586	Because the plasma membrane sodium–potassium ATPase always transports ions, the resting state (negatively charged inside relative to the outside) is restored.
7.38.587	The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the refractory period.
7.38.588	During the refractory period, the membrane cannot generate another action potential. .
7.38.589	The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to return to their resting configurations.
7.38.590	The sodium potassium ATPase continually moves Na+ back out of the cell and K+ back into the cell, and the K+ leaks out leaving negative charge behind.
7.38.591	Very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it can again be depolarized.
7.38.592	Control of Muscle Tension Neural control initiates the formation of actin–myosin cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in muscle contraction.
7.38.593	These contractions extend from the muscle fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal movement.
7.38.594	The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the amount of force created by this tension can vary.
7.38.595	This enables the same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects.
7.38.596	In individual muscle fibers, the amount of tension produced depends on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency of neural stimulation.
7.38.597	The number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin determine the amount of tension that a muscle fiber can produce.
7.38.598	Cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin filaments overlap, allowing myosin to bind to actin.
7.38.599	If more cross-bridges are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension will be produced.
7.38.600	The ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal tension occurs when thick and thin filaments overlap to the greatest degree.
7.38.601	If a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal resting length, thick and thin filaments do not overlap to the greatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form.
7.38.602	This results in fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less tension is produced.
7.38.603	As a sarcomere is shortened, the zone of overlap is reduced as the thin filaments reach the H zone, which is composed of myosin tails.
7.38.604	Because it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin will not bind to myosin in this zone, reducing the tension produced by this myofiber.
7.38.605	If the sarcomere is shortened even more, thin filaments begin to overlap with each other—reducing cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less tension.
7.38.606	Conversely, if the sarcomere is stretched to the point at which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges are formed and no tension is produced.
7.38.607	This amount of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins, internal sensory nerves, and connective tissue oppose extreme stretching.
7.38.608	The primary variable determining force production is the number of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action potential from the neuron that controls that fiber.
7.38.609	When using the biceps to pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain only signals a few neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond.
7.38.610	In vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully if stimulated.
7.38.611	When picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in the biceps and every myofiber participates.
7.38.612	This is close to the maximum force the muscle can produce.
7.38.613	As mentioned above, increasing the frequency of action potentials (the number of signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the tropomyosin is flooded with calcium.
7.39.0	 Lungs, which appear as nearly transparent tissue surrounding the heart in this X-ray of a dog (left), are the central organs of the respiratory system.
7.39.1	The left lung is smaller than the right lung to accommodate space for the heart.
7.39.2	A dog’s nose (right) has a slit on the side of each nostril.
7.39.3	When tracking a scent, the slits open, blocking the front of the nostrils.
7.39.4	This allows the dog to exhale though the now-open area on the side of the nostrils without losing the scent that is being followed.

7.39.6	Introduction Breathing is an involuntary event.
7.39.7	How often a breath is taken and how much air is inhaled or exhaled are tightly regulated by the respiratory center in the brain.
7.39.8	Humans, when they aren’t exerting themselves, breathe approximately 15 times per minute on average.
7.39.9	Canines, like the dog in Figure 39.1, have a respiratory rate of about 15–30 breaths per minute.
7.39.10	With every inhalation, air fills the lungs, and with every exhalation, air rushes back out.
7.39.11	That air is doing more than just inflating and deflating the lungs in the chest cavity.
7.39.12	The air contains oxygen that crosses the lung tissue, enters the bloodstream, and travels to organs and tissues.
7.39.13	Oxygen (O2) enters the cells where it is used for metabolic reactions that produce ATP, a high-energy compound.
7.39.14	At the same time, these reactions release carbon dioxide (CO2) as a by-product.
7.39.15	CO2 is toxic and must be eliminated.
7.39.16	Carbon dioxide exits the cells, enters the bloodstream, travels back to the lungs, and is expired out of the body during exhalation.
7.39.17	The primary function of the respiratory system is to deliver oxygen to the cells of the body’s tissues and remove carbon dioxide, a cell waste product.
7.39.18	The main structures of the human respiratory system are the nasal cavity, the trachea, and lungs.
7.39.19	All aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions.
7.39.20	Along the evolutionary tree, different organisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere.
7.39.21	The environment in which the animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires.
7.39.22	The complexity of the respiratory system is correlated with the size of the organism.
7.39.23	As animal size increases, diffusion distances increase and the ratio of surface area to volume drops.
7.39.24	In unicellular organisms, diffusion across the cell membrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell (Figure 39.2).
7.39.25	Diffusion is a slow, passive transport process.
7.39.26	In order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell, the rate of oxygen uptake must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane.
7.39.27	In other words, if the cell were very large or thick, diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell.
7.39.28	Therefore, dependence on diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only for small organisms or those with highly-flattened bodies, such as many flatworms (Platyhelminthes).
7.39.29	Larger organisms had to evolve specialized respiratory tissues, such as gills, lungs, and respiratory passages accompanied by complex circulatory systems, to transport oxygen throughout their entire body.
7.39.30	he cell of the unicellular algae Ventricaria ventricosa is one of the largest known, reaching one to five centimeters in diameter.
7.39.31	Like all single-celled organisms, V. ventricosa exchanges gases across the cell membrane.
7.39.32	Direct Diffusion For small multicellular organisms, diffusion across the outer membrane is sufficient to meet their oxygen needs.
7.39.33	Gas exchange by direct diffusion across surface membranes is efficient for organisms less than 1 mm in diameter.
7.39.34	In simple organisms, such as cnidarians and flatworms, every cell in the body is close to the external environment.
7.39.35	Their cells are kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion.
7.39.36	Flatworms are small, literally flat worms, which ‘breathe’ through diffusion across the outer membrane (Figure 39.3).
7.39.37	The flat shape of these organisms increases the surface area for diffusion, ensuring that each cell within the body is close to the outer membrane surface and has access to oxygen.
7.39.38	If the flatworm had a cylindrical body, then the cells in the center would not be able to get oxygen.
7.39.39	This flatworm’s process of respiration works by diffusion across the outer membrane.

7.39.41	Skin and Gills Earthworms and amphibians use their skin (integument) as a respiratory organ.
7.39.42	A dense network of capillaries lies just below the skin and facilitates gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory system.
7.39.43	The respiratory surface must be kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell membranes.
7.39.44	Organisms that live in water need to obtain oxygen from the water.
7.39.45	Oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower concentration than in the atmosphere.
7.39.46	The atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen.
7.39.47	In water, the oxygen concentration is much smaller than that.
7.39.48	Fish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water (Figure 39.4).
7.39.49	Gills are thin tissue filaments that are highly branched and folded.
7.39.50	When water passes over the gills, the dissolved oxygen in water rapidly diffuses across the gills into the bloodstream.
7.39.51	The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated blood to the other parts of the body.
7.39.52	In animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill surfaces into the coelomic fluid.
7.39.53	Gills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans.
7.39.54	This common carp, like many other aquatic organisms, has gills that allow it to obtain oxygen from water.
7.39.55	(credit: "Guitardude012"/Wikimedia Commons)
7.39.56	The folded surfaces of the gills provide a large surface area to ensure that the fish gets sufficient oxygen.
7.39.57	Diffusion is a process in which material travels from regions of high concentration to low concentration until equilibrium is reached.
7.39.58	In this case, blood with a low concentration of oxygen molecules circulates through the gills.
7.39.59	The concentration of oxygen molecules in water is higher than the concentration of oxygen molecules in gills.
7.39.60	As a result, oxygen molecules diffuse from water (high concentration) to blood (low concentration), as shown in Figure 39.5.
7.39.61	Similarly, carbon dioxide molecules in the blood diffuse from the blood (high concentration) to water (low concentration).
7.39.62	As water flows over the gills, oxygen is transferred to blood via the veins.

7.39.64	Tracheal Systems Insect respiration is independent of its circulatory system; therefore, the blood does not play a direct role in oxygen transport.
7.39.65	Insects have a highly specialized type of respiratory system called the tracheal system, which consists of a network of small tubes that carries oxygen to the entire body.
7.39.66	The tracheal system is the most direct and efficient respiratory system in active animals.
7.39.67	The tubes in the tracheal system are made of a polymeric material called chitin.
7.39.68	Insect bodies have openings, called spiracles, along the thorax and abdomen.
7.39.69	These openings connect to the tubular network, allowing oxygen to pass into the body (Figure 39.6) and regulating the diffusion of CO2 and water vapor.
7.39.70	Air enters and leaves the tracheal system through the spiracles.
7.39.71	Some insects can ventilate the tracheal system with body movements.
7.39.72	Insects perform respiration via a tracheal system.
7.39.73	Mammalian Systems
7.39.74	In mammals, pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation (breathing).
7.39.75	During inhalation, air enters the body through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose (Figure 39.7).
7.39.76	As air passes through the nasal cavity, the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified.
7.39.77	The respiratory tract is coated with mucus to seal the tissues from direct contact with air.
7.39.78	Mucus is high in water.
7.39.79	As air crosses these surfaces of the mucous membranes, it picks up water.
7.39.80	These processes help equilibrate the air to the body conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause.
7.39.81	Particulate matter that is floating in the air is removed in the nasal passages via mucus and cilia.
7.39.82	The processes of warming, humidifying, and removing particles are important protective mechanisms that prevent damage to the trachea and lungs.
7.39.83	Thus, inhalation serves several purposes in addition to bringing oxygen into the respiratory system.
7.39.84	From the nasal cavity, air passes through the pharynx (throat) and the larynx (voice box), as it makes its way to the trachea (Figure 39.7).
7.39.85	The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body.
7.39.86	The human trachea is a cylinder about 10 to 12 cm long and 2 cm in diameter that sits in front of the esophagus and extends from the larynx into the chest cavity where it divides into the two primary bronchi at the midthorax.
7.39.87	It is made of incomplete rings of hyaline cartilage and smooth muscle (Figure 39.8).
7.39.88	The trachea is lined with mucus-producing goblet cells and ciliated epithelia.
7.39.89	The cilia propel foreign particles trapped in the mucus toward the pharynx.
7.39.90	The cartilage provides strength and support to the trachea to keep the passage open.
7.39.91	The smooth muscle can contract, decreasing the trachea’s diameter, which causes expired air to rush upwards from the lungs at a great force.
7.39.92	The forced exhalation helps expel mucus when we cough.
7.39.93	Smooth muscle can contract or relax, depending on stimuli from the external environment or the body’s nervous system.
7.39.94	The trachea and bronchi are made of incomplete rings of cartilage.

7.39.96	Lungs: Bronchi and Alveoli
7.39.97	The end of the trachea bifurcates (divides) to the right and left lungs.
7.39.98	The lungs are not identical.
7.39.99	The right lung is larger and contains three lobes, whereas the smaller left lung contains two lobes (Figure 39.9).
7.39.100	The muscular diaphragm, which facilitates breathing, is inferior to (below) the lungs and marks the end of the thoracic cavity.
7.39.101	Figure 39.9
7.39.102	The trachea bifurcates into the right and left bronchi in the lungs.
7.39.103	The right lung is made of three lobes and is larger.
7.39.104	To accommodate the heart, the left lung is smaller and has only two lobes.
7.39.105	In the lungs, air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages, or bronchi.
7.39.106	Air enters the lungs through the two primary (main) bronchi (singular: bronchus).
7.39.107	Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi, then into tertiary bronchi, which in turn divide, creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung.
7.39.108	Like the trachea, the bronchi are made of cartilage and smooth muscle.
7.39.109	At the bronchioles, the cartilage is replaced with elastic fibers.
7.39.110	Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction (parasympathetic) or relaxation (sympathetic) in the bronchi and bronchioles, depending on the nervous system’s cues.
7.39.111	In humans, bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles.
7.39.112	They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape.
7.39.113	As the passageways decrease in diameter, the relative amount of smooth muscle increases.
7.39.114	The terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles.
7.39.115	The respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts.
7.39.116	Numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar ducts.
7.39.117	The alveolar sacs resemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles (Figure 39.10).
7.39.118	In the acinar region, the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole.
7.39.119	At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs, each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter.
7.39.120	Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli.
7.39.121	Alveoli are made of thin-walled parenchymal cells, typically one-cell thick, that look like tiny bubbles within the sacs.
7.39.122	Alveoli are in direct contact with capillaries (one-cell thick) of the circulatory system.
7.39.123	Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli into the blood and be distributed to the cells of the body.
7.39.124	In addition, the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a waste product will diffuse from the blood into alveoli to be exhaled.
7.39.125	The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes the structural and functional relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems.
7.39.126	Because there are so many alveoli (~300 million per lung) within each alveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct, the lungs have a sponge-like consistency.
7.39.127	This organization produces a very large surface area that is available for gas exchange.
7.39.128	The surface area of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75 m2.
7.39.129	This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the alveolar parenchymal cells, allows gases to easily diffuse across the cells.
7.39.130	Figure 39.10 Terminal bronchioles are connected by respiratory bronchioles to alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs.
7.39.131	Each alveolar sac contains 20 to 30 spherical alveoli and has the appearance of a bunch of grapes.
7.39.132	Air flows into the atrium of the alveolar sac, then circulates into alveoli where gas exchange occurs with the capillaries.
7.39.133	Mucous glands secrete mucous into the airways, keeping them moist and flexible.

7.39.135	Protective Mechanisms
7.39.136	The air that organisms breathe contains particulate matter such as dust, dirt, viral particles, and bacteria that can damage the lungs or trigger allergic immune responses.
7.39.137	The respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid problems or tissue damage.
7.39.138	In the nasal cavity, hairs and mucus trap small particles, viruses, bacteria, dust, and dirt to prevent their entry.
7.39.139	If particulates do make it beyond the nose, or enter through the mouth, the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs also contain several protective devices.
7.39.140	The lungs produce mucus—a sticky substance made of mucin, a complex glycoprotein, as well as salts and water—that traps particulates.
7.39.141	The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia, small hair-like projections that line the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles (Figure 39.11).
7.39.142	These cilia beat in unison and move mucus and particles out of the bronchi and bronchioles back up to the throat where it is swallowed and eliminated via the esophagus.
7.39.143	In humans, for example, tar and other substances in cigarette smoke destroy or paralyze the cilia, making the removal of particles more difficult.
7.39.144	In addition, smoking causes the lungs to produce more mucus, which the damaged cilia are not able to move.
7.39.145	This causes a persistent cough, as the lungs try to rid themselves of particulate matter, and makes smokers more susceptible to respiratory ailments.
7.39.146	Figure 39.11
7.39.147	The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia that help move mucus and other particles out of the lungs.

7.39.149	The structure of the lung maximizes its surface area to increase gas diffusion.
7.39.150	Because of the enormous number of alveoli (approximately 300 million in each human lung), the surface area of the lung is very large (75 m2).
7.39.151	Having such a large surface area increases the amount of gas that can diffuse into and out of the lungs.
7.39.152	Basic Principles of Gas Exchange Gas exchange during respiration occurs primarily through diffusion.
7.39.153	Diffusion is a process in which transport is driven by a concentration gradient.
7.39.154	Gas molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration.
7.39.155	Blood that is low in oxygen concentration and high in carbon dioxide concentration undergoes gas exchange with air in the lungs.
7.39.156	The air in the lungs has a higher concentration of oxygen than that of oxygen-depleted blood and a lower concentration of carbon dioxide.
7.39.157	This concentration gradient allows for gas exchange during respiration.
7.39.158	Partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases.
7.39.159	The total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture.
7.39.160	The rate of diffusion of a gas is proportional to its partial pressure within the total gas mixture.
7.39.161	This concept is discussed further in detail below.
7.39.162	Lung Volumes and Capacities Different animals have different lung capacities based on their activities.
7.39.163	Cheetahs have evolved a much higher lung capacity than humans; it helps provide oxygen to all the muscles in the body and allows them to run very fast.
7.39.164	Elephants also have a high lung capacity.
7.39.165	In this case, it is not because they run fast but because they have a large body and must be able to take up oxygen in accordance with their body size.
7.39.166	Human lung size is determined by genetics, gender, and height.
7.39.167	At maximal capacity, an average lung can hold almost six liters of air, but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity.
7.39.168	Air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities (Figure 39.12 and Table 39.1).
7.39.169	Volume measures the amount of air for one function (such as inhalation or exhalation).
7.39.170	Capacity is any two or more volumes (for example, how much can be inhaled from the end of a maximal exhalation).
7.39.171	Figure 39.12 Human lung volumes and capacities are shown.
7.39.172	The total lung capacity of the adult male is six liters.
7.39.173	Tidal volume is the volume of air inhaled in a single, normal breath.
7.39.174	Inspiratory capacity is the amount of air taken in during a deep breath, and residual volume is the amount of air left in the lungs after forceful respiration.
7.39.175	The volume in the lung can be divided into four units: tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory reserve volume, and residual volume.
7.39.176	Tidal volume (TV) measures the amount of air that is inspired and expired during a normal breath.
7.39.177	On average, this volume is around one-half liter, which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle.
7.39.178	The expiratory reserve volume (ERV) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation.
7.39.179	It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal.
7.39.180	Conversely, the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation.
7.39.181	The residual volume (RV) is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled.
7.39.182	The lungs are never completely empty: There is always some air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation.
7.39.183	If this residual volume did not exist and the lungs emptied completely, the lung tissues would stick together and the energy necessary to re-inflate the lung could be too great to overcome.
7.39.184	Therefore, there is always some air remaining in the lungs.
7.39.185	Residual volume is also important for preventing large fluctuations in respiratory gases (O2 and CO2).
7.39.186	The residual volume is the only lung volume that cannot be measured directly because it is impossible to completely empty the lung of air.
7.39.187	This volume can only be calculated rather than measured.
7.39.188	Capacities are measurements of two or more volumes.
7.39.189	The vital capacity (VC) measures the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle.
7.39.190	It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve volume.
7.39.191	The inspiratory capacity (IC) is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal expiration.
7.39.192	It is, therefore, the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume.
7.39.193	The functional residual capacity (FRC) includes the expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume.
7.39.194	The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation.
7.39.195	Lastly, the total lung capacity (TLC) is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold.
7.39.196	It is the sum of the residual volume, expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve volume.
7.39.197	Lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry.
7.39.198	An important measurement taken during spirometry is the forced expiratory volume (FEV), which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period, usually one second (FEV1).
7.39.199	In addition, the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled, is measured.
7.39.200	The ratio of these values ( FEV1/FVC ratio) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma, emphysema, and fibrosis.
7.39.201	If the FEV1/FVC ratio is high, the lungs are not compliant (meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly), and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis.
7.39.202	Patients exhale most of the lung volume very quickly.
7.39.203	Conversely, when the FEV1/FVC ratio is low, there is resistance in the lung that is characteristic of asthma.
7.39.204	In this instance, it is hard for the patient to get the air out of his or her lungs, and it takes a long time to reach the maximal exhalation volume.
7.39.205	In either case, breathing is difficult and complications arise.
7.39.206	Gas Pressure and Respiration
7.39.207	The respiratory process can be better understood by examining the properties of gases.
7.39.208	Gases move freely, but gas particles are constantly hitting the walls of their vessel, thereby producing gas pressure.
7.39.209	Air is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (N2; 78.6 percent), oxygen (O2; 20.9 percent), water vapor (H2O; 0.5 percent), and carbon dioxide (CO2; 0.04 percent).
7.39.210	Each gas component of that mixture exerts a pressure.
7.39.211	The pressure for an individual gas in the mixture is the partial pressure of that gas.
7.39.212	Approximately 21 percent of atmospheric gas is oxygen.
7.39.213	Carbon dioxide, however, is found in relatively small amounts, 0.04 percent.
7.39.214	The partial pressure for oxygen is much greater than that of carbon dioxide.
7.39.215	The partial pressure of any gas can be calculated by:
7.39.216	Patm, the atmospheric pressure, is the sum of all of the partial pressures of the atmospheric gases added together.
7.39.217	The pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 760 mm Hg.
7.39.218	Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is: At high altitudes, Patm decreases but concentration does not change; the partial pressure decrease is due to the reduction in Patm.
7.39.219	When the air mixture reaches the lung, it has been humidified.
7.39.220	The pressure of the water vapor in the lung does not change the pressure of the air, but it must be included in the partial pressure equation.
7.39.221	For this calculation, the water pressure (47 mm Hg) is subtracted from the atmospheric pressure: These pressures determine the gas exchange, or the flow of gas, in the system.
7.39.222	Oxygen and carbon dioxide will flow according to their pressure gradient from high to low.
7.39.223	Therefore, understanding the partial pressure of each gas will aid in understanding how gases move in the respiratory system.
7.39.224	Gas Exchange across the Alveoli
7.39.225	In the body, oxygen is used by cells of the body’s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product.
7.39.226	The ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient (RQ).
7.39.227	RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0.
7.39.228	If just glucose were used to fuel the body, the RQ would equal one.
7.39.229	One mole of carbon dioxide would be produced for every mole of oxygen consumed.
7.39.230	Glucose, however, is not the only fuel for the body.
7.39.231	Protein and fat are also used as fuels for the body.
7.39.232	Because of this, less carbon dioxide is produced than oxygen is consumed and the RQ is, on average, about 0.7 for fat and about 0.8 for protein.
7.39.233	The RQ is used to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar spaces within the lung, the alveolar PO2 Above, the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs was calculated to be 150 mm Hg.
7.39.234	However, lungs never fully deflate with an exhalation; therefore, the inspired air mixes with this residual air and lowers the partial pressure of oxygen within the alveoli.
7.39.235	This means that there is a lower concentration of oxygen in the lungs than is found in the air outside the body.
7.39.236	Knowing the RQ, the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli can be calculated:
7.39.237	With an RQ of 0.8 and a PCO2 in the alveoli of 40 mm Hg, the alveolar PO2 is equal to:
7.39.238	Notice that this pressure is less than the external air.
7.39.239	Therefore, the oxygen will flow from the inspired air in the lung ( PO2 = 150 mm Hg) into the bloodstream ( PO2 = 100 mm Hg)
7.39.240	(Figure 39.13).
7.39.241	In the lungs, oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli.
7.39.242	Oxygen (about 98 percent) binds reversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells (RBCs).
7.39.243	RBCs carry oxygen to the tissues where oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues.
7.39.244	More specifically, alveolar PO2 is higher in the alveoli ( PALVO2 = 100 mm Hg) than blood PO2 (40 mm Hg) in the capillaries.
7.39.245	Because this pressure gradient exists, oxygen diffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the alveoli and entering the blood of the capillaries where O2 binds to hemoglobin.
7.39.246	At the same time, alveolar PCO2 is lower
7.39.247	PALVO2 = 40 mm Hg than blood PCO2 =
7.39.248	(45 mm Hg).
7.39.249	CO2 diffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the capillaries and entering the alveoli.
7.39.250	Oxygen and carbon dioxide move independently of each other; they diffuse down their own pressure gradients.
7.39.251	As blood leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins, the venous PO2 = 100 mm Hg, whereas the venous PCO2 = 40 mm Hg.
7.39.252	As blood enters the systemic capillaries, the blood will lose oxygen and gain carbon dioxide because of the pressure difference of the tissues and blood.
7.39.253	In systemic capillaries, PO2 = 100 mm Hg, but in the tissue cells, PO2 = 40 mm Hg.
7.39.254	This pressure gradient drives the diffusion of oxygen out of the capillaries and into the tissue cells.
7.39.255	At the same time, blood PCO2 = 40 mm Hg and systemic tissue PCO2
7.39.256	= 45 mm Hg.
7.39.257	The pressure gradient drives CO2 out of tissue cells and into the capillaries.
7.39.258	The blood returning to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries has a venous PO2 = 40 mm Hg and a PCO2 = 45 mm Hg.
7.39.259	The blood enters the lung capillaries where the process of exchanging gases between the capillaries and alveoli begins again.
7.39.260	In short, the change in partial pressure from the alveoli to the capillaries drives the oxygen into the tissues and the carbon dioxide into the blood from the tissues.
7.39.261	The blood is then transported to the lungs where differences in pressure in the alveoli result in the movement of carbon dioxide out of the blood into the lungs, and oxygen into the blood.
7.39.262	Mammalian lungs are located in the thoracic cavity where they are surrounded and protected by the rib cage, intercostal muscles, and bound by the chest wall.
7.39.263	The bottom of the lungs is contained by the diaphragm, a skeletal muscle that facilitates breathing.
7.39.264	Breathing requires the coordination of the lungs, the chest wall, and most importantly, the diaphragm.
7.39.265	Types of Breathing Amphibians have evolved multiple ways of breathing.
7.39.266	Young amphibians, like tadpoles, use gills to breathe, and they don’t leave the water.
7.39.267	Some amphibians retain gills for life.
7.39.268	As the tadpole grows, the gills disappear and lungs grow.
7.39.269	These lungs are primitive and not as evolved as mammalian lungs.
7.39.270	Adult amphibians are lacking or have a reduced diaphragm, so breathing via lungs is forced.
7.39.271	The other means of breathing for amphibians is diffusion across the skin.
7.39.272	To aid this diffusion, amphibian skin must remain moist.
7.39.273	Birds face a unique challenge with respect to breathing: They fly.
7.39.274	Flying consumes a great amount of energy; therefore, birds require a lot of oxygen to aid their metabolic processes.
7.39.275	Birds have evolved a respiratory system that supplies them with the oxygen needed to enable flying.
7.39.276	Similar to mammals, birds have lungs, which are organs specialized for gas exchange.
7.39.277	Oxygenated air, taken in during inhalation, diffuses across the surface of the lungs into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs and expelled during exhalation.
7.39.278	The details of breathing between birds and mammals differ substantially.
7.39.279	In addition to lungs, birds have air sacs inside their body.
7.39.280	Air flows in one direction from the posterior air sacs to the lungs and out of the anterior air sacs.
7.39.281	The flow of air is in the opposite direction from blood flow, and gas exchange takes place much more efficiently.
7.39.282	This type of breathing enables birds to obtain the requisite oxygen, even at higher altitudes where the oxygen concentration is low.
7.39.283	This directionality of airflow requires two cycles of air intake and exhalation to completely get the air out of the lungs.
7.39.284	All mammals have lungs that are the main organs for breathing.
7.39.285	Lung capacity has evolved to support the animal’s activities.
7.39.286	During inhalation, the lungs expand with air, and oxygen diffuses across the lung’s surface and enters the bloodstream.
7.39.287	During exhalation, the lungs expel air and lung volume decreases.
7.39.288	In the next few sections, the process of human breathing will be explained.
7.39.289	The Mechanics of Human Breathing Boyle’s Law is the gas law that states that in a closed space, pressure and volume are inversely related.
7.39.290	As volume decreases, pressure increases and vice versa (Figure 39.15).
7.39.291	The relationship between gas pressure and volume helps to explain the mechanics of breathing.
7.39.292	This graph shows data from Boyle’s original 1662 experiment, which shows that pressure and volume are inversely related.
7.39.293	No units are given as Boyle used arbitrary units in his experiments.
7.39.294	There is always a slightly negative pressure within the thoracic cavity, which aids in keeping the airways of the lungs open.
7.39.295	During inhalation, volume increases as a result of contraction of the diaphragm, and pressure decreases (according to Boyle’s Law).
7.39.296	This decrease of pressure in the thoracic cavity relative to the environment makes the cavity less than the atmosphere (Figure 39.16a).
7.39.297	Because of this drop in pressure, air rushes into the respiratory passages.
7.39.298	To increase the volume of the lungs, the chest wall expands.
7.39.299	This results from the contraction of the intercostal muscles, the muscles that are connected to the rib cage.
7.39.300	Lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostals muscles contract, thus expanding the thoracic cavity.
7.39.301	This increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity lowers pressure compared to the atmosphere, so air rushes into the lungs, thus increasing its volume.
7.39.302	The resulting increase in volume is largely attributed to an increase in alveolar space, because the bronchioles and bronchi are stiff structures that do not change in size.
7.39.303	The lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm are all involved in respiration, both (a) inhalation and (b) expiration.
7.39.304	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.39.305	The chest wall expands out and away from the lungs.
7.39.306	The lungs are elastic; therefore, when air fills the lungs, the elastic recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs.
7.39.307	These outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath.
7.39.308	Upon exhalation, the lungs recoil to force the air out of the lungs, and the intercostal muscles relax, returning the chest wall back to its original position (Figure 39.16b).
7.39.309	The diaphragm also relaxes and moves higher into the thoracic cavity.
7.39.310	This increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to the environment, and air rushes out of the lungs.
7.39.311	The movement of air out of the lungs is a passive event.
7.39.312	No muscles are contracting to expel the air.
7.39.313	Each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac.
7.39.314	The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral pleura.
7.39.315	A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax (Figure 39.17).
7.39.316	The space between these layers, the intrapleural space, contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax.
7.39.317	Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung.
7.39.318	A tissue layer called pleura surrounds the lung and interior of the thoracic cavity.

7.39.320	The Work of Breathing
7.39.321	The number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate.
7.39.322	On average, under non-exertion conditions, the human respiratory rate is 12–15 breaths/minute.
7.39.323	The respiratory rate contributes to the alveolar ventilation, or how much air moves into and out of the alveoli.
7.39.324	Alveolar ventilation prevents carbon dioxide buildup in the alveoli.
7.39.325	There are two ways to keep the alveolar ventilation constant: increase the respiratory rate while decreasing the tidal volume of air per breath (shallow breathing), or decrease the respiratory rate while increasing the tidal volume per breath.
7.39.326	In either case, the ventilation remains the same, but the work done and type of work needed are quite different.
7.39.327	Both tidal volume and respiratory rate are closely regulated when oxygen demand increases.
7.39.328	There are two types of work conducted during respiration, flow-resistive and elastic work.
7.39.329	Flow-resistive refers to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung, whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles, chest wall, and diaphragm.
7.39.330	Increasing the respiration rate increases the flow-resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles.
7.39.331	Decreasing the respiratory rate reverses the type of work required.
7.39.332	Surfactant The air-tissue/water interface of the alveoli has a high surface tension.
7.39.333	This surface tension is similar to the surface tension of water at the liquid-air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together.
7.39.334	Surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the alveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli.
7.39.335	By lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid, it reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse.
7.39.336	Surfactant works like a detergent to reduce the surface tension and allows for easier inflation of the airways.
7.39.337	When a balloon is first inflated, it takes a large amount of effort to stretch the plastic and start to inflate the balloon.
7.39.338	If a little bit of detergent was applied to the interior of the balloon, then the amount of effort or work needed to begin to inflate the balloon would decrease, and it would become much easier to start blowing up the balloon.
7.39.339	This same principle applies to the airways.
7.39.340	A small amount of surfactant to the airway tissues reduces the effort or work needed to inflate those airways.
7.39.341	Babies born prematurely sometimes do not produce enough surfactant.
7.39.342	As a result, they suffer from respiratory distress syndrome, because it requires more effort to inflate their lungs.
7.39.343	Surfactant is also important for preventing collapse of small alveoli relative to large alveoli.
7.39.344	Lung Resistance and Compliance Pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs.
7.39.345	Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are compliance (how elastic the lung is) and resistance (how much obstruction exists in the airways).
7.39.346	A change in either can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.
7.39.347	Examples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis.
7.39.348	In both diseases, the airways are less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic.
7.39.349	There is a decrease in compliance because the lung tissue cannot bend and move.
7.39.350	In these types of restrictive diseases, the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation, which traps air in the lungs.
7.39.351	Forced or functional vital capacity (FVC), which is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after taking the deepest breath possible, is much lower than in normal patients, and the time it takes to exhale most of the air is greatly prolonged (Figure 39.18).
7.39.352	A patient suffering from these diseases cannot exhale the normal amount of air.
7.39.353	Obstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema, asthma, and pulmonary edema.
7.39.354	In emphysema, which mostly arises from smoking tobacco, the walls of the alveoli are destroyed, decreasing the surface area for gas exchange.
7.39.355	The overall compliance of the lungs is increased, because as the alveolar walls are damaged, lung elastic recoil decreases due to a loss of elastic fibers, and more air is trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation.
7.39.356	Asthma is a disease in which inflammation is triggered by environmental factors.
7.39.357	Inflammation obstructs the airways.
7.39.358	The obstruction may be due to edema (fluid accumulation), smooth muscle spasms in the walls of the bronchioles, increased mucus secretion, damage to the epithelia of the airways, or a combination of these events.
7.39.359	Those with asthma or edema experience increased occlusion from increased inflammation of the airways.
7.39.360	This tends to block the airways, preventing the proper movement of gases (Figure 39.18).
7.39.361	Those with obstructive diseases have large volumes of air trapped after exhalation and breathe at a very high lung volume to compensate for the lack of airway recruitment.
7.39.362	The ratio of FEV1 (the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second after taking a deep breath) to FVC (the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled) can be used to diagnose whether a person has restrictive or obstructive lung disease.
7.39.363	In restrictive lung disease, FVC is reduced but airways are not obstructed, so the person is able to expel air reasonably fast.
7.39.364	In obstructive lung disease, airway obstruction results in slow exhalation as well as reduced FVC.
7.39.365	Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio is lower in persons with obstructive lung disease (less than 69 percent) than in persons with restrictive disease (88 to 90 percent).
7.39.366	Dead Space: V/Q
7.39.367	Mismatch Pulmonary circulation pressure is very low compared to that of the systemic circulation.
7.39.368	It is also independent of cardiac output.
7.39.369	This is because of a phenomenon called recruitment, which is the process of opening airways that normally remain closed when cardiac output increases.
7.39.370	As cardiac output increases, the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused (filled with blood) increases.
7.39.371	These capillaries and arteries are not always in use but are ready if needed.
7.39.372	At times, however, there is a mismatch between the amount of air (ventilation, V) and the amount of blood (perfusion, Q) in the lungs.
7.39.373	This is referred to as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.
7.39.374	There are two types of V/Q mismatch.
7.39.375	Both produce dead space, regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue.
7.39.376	Dead spaces can severely impact breathing, because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion.
7.39.377	As a result, the amount of oxygen in the blood decreases, whereas the carbon dioxide level increases.
7.39.378	Dead space is created when no ventilation and/or perfusion takes place.
7.39.379	Anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt, arises from an anatomical failure, while physiological dead space or physiological shunt, arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries.
7.39.380	An example of an anatomical shunt is the effect of gravity on the lungs.
7.39.381	The lung is particularly susceptible to changes in the magnitude and direction of gravitational forces.
7.39.382	When someone is standing or sitting upright, the pleural pressure gradient leads to increased ventilation further down in the lung.
7.39.383	As a result, the intrapleural pressure is more negative at the base of the lung than at the top, and more air fills the bottom of the lung than the top.
7.39.384	Likewise, it takes less energy to pump blood to the bottom of the lung than to the top when in a prone position.
7.39.385	Perfusion of the lung is not uniform while standing or sitting.
7.39.386	This is a result of hydrostatic forces combined with the effect of airway pressure.
7.39.387	An anatomical shunt develops because the ventilation of the airways does not match the perfusion of the arteries surrounding those airways.
7.39.388	As a result, the rate of gas exchange is reduced.
7.39.389	Note that this does not occur when lying down, because in this position, gravity does not preferentially pull the bottom of the lung down.
7.39.390	A physiological shunt can develop if there is infection or edema in the lung that obstructs an area.
7.39.391	This will decrease ventilation but not affect perfusion; therefore, the V/Q ratio changes and gas exchange is affected.
7.39.392	The lung can compensate for these mismatches in ventilation and perfusion.
7.39.393	If ventilation is greater than perfusion, the arterioles dilate and the bronchioles constrict.
7.39.394	This increases perfusion and reduces ventilation.
7.39.395	Likewise, if ventilation is less than perfusion, the arterioles constrict and the bronchioles dilate to correct the imbalance.
7.39.396	Once the oxygen diffuses across the alveoli, it enters the bloodstream and is transported to the tissues where it is unloaded, and carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be expelled from the body.
7.39.397	Although gas exchange is a continuous process, the oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by different mechanisms.
7.39.398	Transport of Oxygen in the Blood
7.39.399	Although oxygen dissolves in blood, only a small amount of oxygen is transported this way.
7.39.400	Only 1.5 percent of oxygen in the blood is dissolved directly into the blood itself.
7.39.401	Most oxygen—98.5 percent—is bound to a protein called hemoglobin and carried to the tissues.
7.39.402	Hemoglobin Hemoglobin, or Hb, is a protein molecule found in red blood cells (erythrocytes) made of four subunits: two alpha subunits and two beta subunits (Figure 39.19).
7.39.403	Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule, allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules.
7.39.404	Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red.
7.39.405	As a result, oxygenated arterial blood where the Hb is carrying four oxygen molecules is bright red, while venous blood that is deoxygenated is darker red.
7.39.406	The protein inside (a) red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells and carbon dioxide to the lungs is (b) hemoglobin.
7.39.407	Hemoglobin is made up of four symmetrical subunits and four heme groups.
7.39.408	Iron associated with the heme binds oxygen.
7.39.409	It is the iron in hemoglobin that gives blood its red color.
7.39.410	It is easier to bind a second and third oxygen molecule to Hb than the first molecule.
7.39.411	This is because the hemoglobin molecule changes its shape, or conformation, as oxygen binds.
7.39.412	The fourth oxygen is then more difficult to bind.
7.39.413	The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (x-axis) versus the relative Hb-oxygen saturation (y-axis).
7.39.414	The resulting graph—
7.39.415	an oxygen dissociation curve—is sigmoidal, or S-shaped (Figure 39.20).
7.39.416	As the partial pressure of oxygen increases, the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen.
7.39.417	Factors That Affect Oxygen Binding
7.39.418	The oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood.
7.39.419	In addition to PO2 , other environmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying capacity and delivery.
7.39.420	Carbon dioxide levels, blood pH, and body temperature affect oxygen-carrying capacity (Figure 39.20).
7.39.421	When carbon dioxide is in the blood, it reacts with water to form bicarbonate (HCO−3 ) and hydrogen ions (H+).
7.39.422	As the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases, more H+ is produced and the pH decreases.
7.39.423	This increase in carbon dioxide and subsequent decrease in pH reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen.
7.39.424	The oxygen dissociates from the Hb molecule, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right.
7.39.425	Therefore, more oxygen is needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level as when the pH was higher.
7.39.426	A similar shift in the curve also results from an increase in body temperature.
7.39.427	Increased temperature, such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle, causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced.
7.39.428	Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen- carrying capacity.
7.39.429	In sickle cell anemia, the shape of the red blood cell is crescent-shaped, elongated, and stiffened, reducing its ability to deliver oxygen (Figure 39.21).
7.39.430	In this form, red blood cells cannot pass through the capillaries.
7.39.431	This is painful when it occurs.
7.39.432	Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb.
7.39.433	Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells, but these cells have lower-than-normal levels of hemoglobin.
7.39.434	Therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity is diminished.
7.39.435	Individuals with sickle cell anemia have crescent-shaped red blood cells.

7.39.437	Transport of Carbon Dioxide in the Blood Carbon dioxide molecules are transported in the blood from body tissues to the lungs by one of three methods: dissolution directly into the blood, binding to hemoglobin, or carried as a bicarbonate ion.
7.39.438	Several properties of carbon dioxide in the blood affect its transport.
7.39.439	First, carbon dioxide is more soluble in blood than oxygen.
7.39.440	About 5 to 7 percent of all carbon dioxide is dissolved in the plasma.
7.39.441	Second, carbon dioxide can bind to plasma proteins or can enter red blood cells and bind to hemoglobin.
7.39.442	This form transports about 10 percent of the carbon dioxide.
7.39.443	When carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin, a molecule called carbaminohemoglobin is formed.
7.39.444	Binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is reversible.
7.39.445	Therefore, when it reaches the lungs, the carbon dioxide can freely dissociate from the hemoglobin and be expelled from the body.
7.39.446	Third, the majority of carbon dioxide molecules (85 percent) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system.
7.39.447	In this system, carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells.
7.39.448	Carbonic anhydrase (CA) within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid (H2CO3).
7.39.449	Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate moleculethat immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions (HCO3 ) and hydrogen (H ) ions.
7.39.450	Since carbon dioxide is quickly converted into bicarbonate ions, this reaction allows for the continued uptake of carbon dioxide into the blood down its concentration gradient.
7.39.451	It also results in the production of H+ ions.
7.39.452	If too much H+ is produced, it can alter blood pH.
7.39.453	However, hemoglobin binds to the free H+ ions and thus limits shifts in pH.
7.39.454	The newly synthesized bicarbonate ion is transported out of the red blood cell into the liquid component of the blood in exchange for a chloride ion (Cl-); this is called the chloride shift.
7.39.455	When the blood reaches the lungs, the bicarbonate ion is transported back into the red blood cell in exchange for the chloride ion.
7.39.456	The H+ ion dissociates from the hemoglobin and binds to the bicarbonate ion.
7.39.457	This produces the carbonic acid intermediate, which is converted back into carbon dioxide through the enzymatic action of CA.
7.39.458	The carbon dioxide produced is expelled through the lungs during exhalation.
7.39.459	The benefit of the bicarbonate buffer system is that carbon dioxide is “soaked up” into the blood with little change to the pH of the system.
7.39.460	This is important because it takes only a small change in the overall pH of the body for severe injury or death to result.
7.39.461	The presence of this bicarbonate buffer system also allows for people to travel and live at high altitudes:
7.39.462	When the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide change at high altitudes, the bicarbonate buffer system adjusts to regulate carbon dioxide while maintaining the correct pH in the body.
7.39.463	Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
7.39.464	While carbon dioxide can readily associate and dissociate from hemoglobin, other molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO) cannot.
7.39.465	Carbon monoxide has a greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen.
7.39.466	Therefore, when carbon monoxide is present, it binds to hemoglobin preferentially over oxygen.
7.39.467	As a result, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin, so very little oxygen is transported through the body (Figure 39.22).
7.39.468	Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas and is therefore difficult to detect.
7.39.469	It is produced by gas-powered vehicles and tools.
7.39.470	Carbon monoxide can cause headaches, confusion, and nausea; long-term exposure can cause brain damage or death.
7.39.471	Administering 100 percent (pure) oxygen is the usual treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning.
7.39.472	Administration of pure oxygen speeds up the separation of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin.          
7.40.0	Introduction
7.40.1	Most animals are complex multicellular organisms that require a mechanism for transporting nutrients throughout their bodies and removing waste products.
7.40.2	The circulatory system has evolved over time from simple diffusion through cells in the early evolution of animals to a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the human body.
7.40.3	This extensive network supplies the cells, tissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste, which are byproducts of respiration.
7.40.4	At the core of the human circulatory system is the heart.
7.40.5	The size of a clenched fist, the human heart is protected beneath the rib cage.
7.40.6	Made of specialized and unique cardiac muscle, it pumps blood throughout the body and to the heart itself.
7.40.7	Heart contractions are driven by intrinsic electrical impulses that the brain and endocrine hormones help to regulate.
7.40.8	Understanding the heart’s basic anatomy and function is important to understanding the body’s circulatory and respiratory systems.
7.40.9	Gas exchange is one essential function of the circulatory system.
7.40.10	A circulatory system is not needed in organisms with no specialized respiratory organs because oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse directly between their body tissues and the external environment.
7.40.11	However, in organisms that possess lungs and gills, oxygen must be transported from these specialized respiratory organs to the body tissues via a circulatory system.
7.40.12	Therefore, circulatory systems have had to evolve to accommodate the great diversity of body sizes and body types present among animals.
7.40.13	In all animals, except a few simple types, the circulatory system is used to transport nutrients and gases through the body.
7.40.14	Simple diffusion allows some water, nutrient, waste, and gas exchange into primitive animals that are only a few cell layers thick; however, bulk flow is the only method by which the entire body of larger more complex organisms is accessed.
7.40.15	Circulatory System Architecture
7.40.16	The circulatory system is effectively a network of cylindrical vessels: the arteries, veins, and capillaries that emanate from a pump, the heart.
7.40.17	In all vertebrate organisms, as well as some invertebrates, this is a closed-loop system, in which the blood is not free in a cavity.
7.40.18	In a closed circulatory system, blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route, then returns to the heart again, as illustrated in Figure 40.2a.
7.40.19	As opposed to a closed system, arthropods—including insects, crustaceans, and most mollusks—have an open circulatory system, as illustrated in Figure 40.2b.
7.40.20	In an open circulatory system, the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid.
7.40.21	As the heart beats and the animal moves, the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia.
7.40.22	This movement allows for gas and nutrient exchange.
7.40.23	An open circulatory system does not use as much energy as a closed system to operate or to maintain; however, there is a trade-off with the amount of blood that can be moved to metabolically active organs and tissues that require high levels of oxygen.
7.40.24	In fact, one reason that insects with wing spans of up to two feet wide (70 cm) are not around today is probably because they were outcompeted by the arrival of birds 150 million years ago.
7.40.25	Birds, having a closed circulatory system, are thought to have moved more agilely, allowing them to get food faster and possibly to prey on the insects.
7.40.26	In (a) closed circulatory systems, the heart pumps blood through vessels that are separate from the interstitial fluid of the body.
7.40.27	Most vertebrates and some invertebrates, like this annelid earthworm, have a closed circulatory system.
7.40.28	In (b) open circulatory systems, a fluid called hemolymph is pumped through a blood vessel that empties into the body cavity.
7.40.29	Hemolymph returns to the blood vessel through openings called ostia.
7.40.30	Arthropods like this bee and most mollusks have open circulatory systems.
7.40.31	Circulatory System Variation in Animals
7.40.32	The circulatory system varies from simple systems in invertebrates to more complex systems in vertebrates.
7.40.33	The simplest animals, such as the sponges (Porifera) and rotifers (Rotifera), do not need a circulatory system because diffusion allows adequate exchange of water, nutrients, and waste, as well as dissolved gases, as shown in Figure 40.3a.
7.40.34	Organisms that are more complex
7.40.35	but still only have two layers of cells in their body plan, such as jellies (Cnidaria) and comb jellies (Ctenophora) also use diffusion through their epidermis and internally through the gastrovascular compartment.
7.40.36	Both their internal and external tissues are bathed in an aqueous environment and exchange fluids by diffusion on both sides, as illustrated in Figure 40.3b.
7.40.37	Exchange of fluids is assisted by the pulsing of the jellyfish body.
7.40.38	Simple animals consisting of a single cell layer such as the (a) sponge or only a few cell layers such as the (b) jellyfish do not have a circulatory system.
7.40.39	Instead, gases, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged by diffusion.
7.40.40	For more complex organisms, diffusion is not efficient for cycling gases, nutrients, and waste effectively through the body; therefore, more complex circulatory systems evolved.
7.40.41	Most arthropods and many mollusks have open circulatory systems.
7.40.42	In an open system, an elongated beating heart pushes the hemolymph through the body and muscle contractions help to move fluids.
7.40.43	The larger more complex crustaceans, including lobsters, have developed arterial-like vessels to push blood through their bodies, and the most active mollusks, such as squids, have evolved a closed circulatory system and are able to move rapidly to catch prey.
7.40.44	Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptation during evolution and associated differences in anatomy.
7.40.45	Figure 40.4 illustrates the basic circulatory systems of some vertebrates: fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.
7.40.46	Fish have the simplest circulatory systems of the vertebrates: blood flows unidirectionally from the two- chambered heart through the gills and then the rest of the body.
7.40.47	(b) Amphibians have two circulatory routes: one for oxygenation of the blood through the lungs and skin, and the other to take oxygen to the rest of the body.
7.40.48	The blood is pumped from a three-chambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle.
7.40.49	(c) Reptiles also have two circulatory routes; however, blood is only oxygenated through the lungs.
7.40.50	The heart is three chambered, but the ventricles are partially separated so some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood occurs except in crocodilians and birds.
7.40.51	(d) Mammals and birds have the most efficient heart with four chambers that completely separate the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood; it pumps only oxygenated blood through the body and deoxygenated blood to the lungs.
7.40.52	As illustrated in Figure 40.4a Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two-chambered heart that has only a single atrium and a single ventricle.
7.40.53	The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re-oxygenated; this is called gill circulation.
7.40.54	The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium; this is called systemic circulation.
7.40.55	This unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish’s systemic circuit.
7.40.56	The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body, reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish.
7.40.57	In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation).
7.40.58	In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation.
7.40.59	As shown in Figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish.
7.40.60	The two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation.
7.40.61	The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body.
7.40.62	The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit.
7.40.63	For this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation.
7.40.64	Most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in Figure 40.4c.
7.40.65	The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.
7.40.66	Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart.
7.40.67	Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot.
7.40.68	One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body.
7.40.69	Two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs.
7.40.70	Together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth.
7.40.71	In mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in Figure 40.4d.
7.40.72	The oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds.
7.40.73	The four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart.
7.40.74	The independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is referred to as convergent evolution.
7.40.75	Hemoglobin is responsible for distributing oxygen, and to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide, throughout the circulatory systems of humans, vertebrates, and many invertebrates.
7.40.76	The blood is more than the proteins, though.
7.40.77	Blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma (the liquid portion, which contains water, proteins, salts, lipids, and glucose) and the cells (red and white cells) and cell fragments called platelets.
7.40.78	Blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water, proteins, electrolytes, lipids, and glucose.
7.40.79	The cells are responsible for carrying the gases (red cells) and immune the response (white).
7.40.80	The platelets are responsible for blood clotting.
7.40.81	Interstitial fluid that surrounds cells is separate from the blood, but in hemolymph, they are combined.
7.40.82	In humans, cellular components make up approximately 45 percent of the blood and the liquid plasma 55 percent.
7.40.83	Blood is 20 percent of a person’s extracellular fluid and eight percent of weight.
7.40.84	The Role of Blood in the Body Blood, like the human blood illustrated in Figure 40.5 is important for regulation of the body’s systems and homeostasis.
7.40.85	Blood helps maintain homeostasis by stabilizing pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, and by eliminating excess heat.
7.40.86	Blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones, and by removing waste.
7.40.87	Blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease-fighting agents or white blood cells to sites of infection.
7.40.88	The cells and cellular components of human blood are shown.
7.40.89	Red blood cells deliver oxygen to the cells and remove carbon dioxide.
7.40.90	White blood cells—including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils—are involved in the immune response.
7.40.91	Platelets form clots that prevent blood loss after injury.
7.40.92	Red Blood Cells Red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythro- = “red”; -cyte =
7.40.93	“cell”), are specialized cells that circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells; they are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow.
7.40.94	In mammals, red blood cells are small biconcave cells that at maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 7–8 μm in size.
7.40.95	In birds and non- avian reptiles, a nucleus is still maintained in red blood cells.
7.40.96	The red coloring of blood comes from the iron-containing protein hemoglobin, illustrated in Figure 40.6a.
7.40.97	The principal job of this protein is to carry oxygen, but it also transports carbon dioxide as well.
7.40.98	Hemoglobin is packed into red blood cells at a rate of about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin per cell.
7.40.99	Each hemoglobin molecule binds four oxygen molecules so that each red blood cell carries one billion molecules of oxygen.
7.40.100	There are approximately 25 trillion red blood cells in the five liters of blood in the human body, which could carry up to 25 sextillion (25 × 1021) molecules of oxygen in the body at any time.
7.40.101	In mammals, the lack of organelles in erythrocytes leaves more room for the hemoglobin molecules, and the lack of mitochondria also prevents use of the oxygen for metabolic respiration.
7.40.102	Only mammals have anucleated red blood cells, and some mammals (camels, for instance) even have nucleated red blood cells.
7.40.103	The advantage of nucleated red blood cells is that these cells can undergo mitosis.
7.40.104	Anucleated red blood cells metabolize anaerobically (without oxygen), making use of a primitive metabolic pathway to produce ATP and increase the efficiency of oxygen transport.
7.40.105	Not all organisms use hemoglobin as the method of oxygen transport.
7.40.106	Invertebrates that utilize hemolymph rather than blood use different pigments to bind to the oxygen.
7.40.107	These pigments use copper or iron to the oxygen.
7.40.108	Invertebrates have a variety of other respiratory pigments.
7.40.109	Hemocyanin, a blue-green, copper-containing protein, illustrated in Figure 40.6b is found in mollusks, crustaceans, and some of the arthropods.
7.40.110	Chlorocruorin, a green-colored, iron-containing pigment is found in four families of polychaete tubeworms.
7.40.111	Hemerythrin, a red, iron-containing protein is found in some polychaete worms and annelids and is illustrated in Figure 40.6c.
7.40.112	Despite the name, hemerythrin does not contain a heme group and its oxygen-carrying capacity is poor compared to hemoglobin.
7.40.113	In most vertebrates, (a) hemoglobin delivers oxygen to the body and removes some carbon dioxide.
7.40.114	Hemoglobin is composed of four protein subunits, two alpha chains and two beta chains, and a heme group that has iron associated with it.
7.40.115	The iron reversibly associates with oxygen, and in so doing is oxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+.
7.40.116	In most mollusks and some arthropods, (b) hemocyanin delivers oxygen.
7.40.117	Unlike hemoglobin, hemolymph is not carried in blood cells, but floats free in the hemolymph.
7.40.118	Copper instead of iron binds the oxygen, giving the hemolymph a blue- green color.
7.40.119	In annelids, such as the earthworm, and some other invertebrates,
7.40.120	(c) hemerythrin carries oxygen.
7.40.121	Like hemoglobin, hemerythrin is carried in blood cells and has iron associated with it, but despite its name, hemerythrin does not contain heme.
7.40.122	The small size and large surface area of red blood cells allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the plasma membrane.
7.40.123	In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is taken in by the blood.
7.40.124	In the tissues, oxygen is released from the blood and carbon dioxide is bound for transport back to the lungs.
7.40.125	Studies have found that hemoglobin also binds nitrous oxide (NO).
7.40.126	NO is a vasodilator that relaxes the blood vessels and capillaries and may help with gas exchange and the passage of red blood cells through narrow vessels.
7.40.127	Nitroglycerin, a heart medication for angina and heart attacks, is converted to NO to help relax the blood vessels and increase oxygen flow through the body.
7.40.128	A characteristic of red blood cells is their glycolipid and glycoprotein coating; these are lipids and proteins that have carbohydrate molecules attached.
7.40.129	In humans, the surface glycoproteins and glycolipids on red blood cells vary between individuals, producing the different blood types, such as A, B, and O. Red blood cells have an average life span of 120 days, at which time they are broken down and recycled in the liver and spleen by phagocytic macrophages, a type of white blood cell.
7.40.130	White Blood Cells White blood cells, also called leukocytes (leuko = white), make up approximately one percent by volume of the cells in blood.
7.40.131	The role of white blood cells is very different than that of red blood cells: they are primarily involved in the immune response to identify and target pathogens, such as invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms.
7.40.132	White blood cells are formed continually; some only live for hours or days, but some live for years.
7.40.133	The morphology of white blood cells differs significantly from red blood cells.
7.40.134	They have nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin.
7.40.135	The different types of white blood cells are identified by their microscopic appearance after histologic staining, and each has a different specialized function.
7.40.136	The two main groups, both illustrated in Figure 40.7 are the granulocytes, which include the neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, and the agranulocytes, which include the monocytes and lymphocytes.
7.40.137	Granulocytes—including neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils—are characterized by a lobed nucleus and granular inclusions in the cytoplasm.
7.40.138	Granulocytes are typically first-responders during injury or infection.
7.40.139	(b) Agranulocytes include lymphocytes and monocytes.
7.40.140	Lymphocytes, including B and T cells, are responsible for adaptive immune response.
7.40.141	Monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, which in turn respond to infection or injury.
7.40.142	Granulocytes contain granules in their cytoplasm; the agranulocytes are so named because of the lack of granules in their cytoplasm.
7.40.143	Some leukocytes become macrophages that either stay at the same site or move through the blood stream and gather at sites of infection or inflammation where they are attracted by chemical signals from foreign particles and damaged cells.
7.40.144	Lymphocytes are the primary cells of the immune system and include B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells.
7.40.145	B cells destroy bacteria and inactivate their toxins.
7.40.146	They also produce antibodies.
7.40.147	T cells attack viruses, fungi, some bacteria, transplanted cells, and cancer cells.
7.40.148	T cells attack viruses by releasing toxins that kill the viruses.
7.40.149	Natural killer cells attack a variety of infectious microbes and certain tumor cells.
7.40.150	One reason that HIV poses significant management challenges is because the virus directly targets T cells by gaining entry through a receptor.
7.40.151	Once inside the cell, HIV then multiplies using the T cell’s own genetic machinery.
7.40.152	After the HIV virus replicates, it is transmitted directly from the infected T cell to macrophages.
7.40.153	The presence of HIV can remain unrecognized for an extensive period of time before full disease symptoms develop.
7.40.154	Platelets and Coagulation Factors Blood must clot to heal wounds and prevent excess blood loss.
7.40.155	Small cell fragments called platelets (thrombocytes) are attracted to the wound site where they adhere by extending many projections and releasing their contents.
7.40.156	These contents activate other platelets and also interact with other coagulation factors, which convert fibrinogen, a water-soluble protein present in blood serum into fibrin (a non-water soluble protein), causing the blood to clot.
7.40.157	Many of the clotting factors require vitamin K to work, and vitamin K deficiency can lead to problems with blood clotting.
7.40.158	Many platelets converge and stick together at the wound site forming a platelet plug (also called a fibrin clot), as illustrated in Figure 40.8b.
7.40.159	The plug or clot lasts for a number of days and stops the loss of blood.
7.40.160	Platelets are formed from the disintegration of larger cells called megakaryocytes, like that shown in Figure 40.8a.
7.40.161	For each megakaryocyte, 2000–3000 platelets are formed with 150,000 to 400,000 platelets present in each cubic millimeter of blood.
7.40.162	Each platelet is disc shaped and 2–4 μm in diameter.
7.40.163	They contain many small vesicles but do not contain a nucleus.
7.40.164	Platelets are formed from large cells called megakaryocytes.
7.40.165	The megakaryocyte breaks up into thousands of fragments that become platelets.
7.40.166	(b) Platelets are required for clotting of the blood.
7.40.167	The platelets collect at a wound site in conjunction with other clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, to form a fibrin clot that prevents blood loss and allows the wound to heal.
7.40.168	Plasma and Serum
7.40.169	The liquid component of blood is called plasma, and it is separated by spinning or centrifuging the blood at high rotations (3000 rpm or higher).
7.40.170	The blood cells and platelets are separated by centrifugal forces to the bottom of a specimen tube.
7.40.171	The upper liquid layer, the plasma, consists of 90 percent water along with various substances required for maintaining the body’s pH, osmotic load, and for protecting the body.
7.40.172	The plasma also contains the coagulation factors and antibodies.
7.40.173	The plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum.
7.40.174	Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves.
7.40.175	Other components in the serum include proteins that assist with maintaining pH and osmotic balance while giving viscosity to the blood.
7.40.176	The serum also contains antibodies, specialized proteins that are important for defense against viruses and bacteria.
7.40.177	Lipids, including cholesterol, are also transported in the serum, along with various other substances including nutrients, hormones, metabolic waste, plus external substances, such as, drugs, viruses, and bacteria.
7.40.178	Human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma and is synthesized in the liver.
7.40.179	Albumin, which constitutes about half of the blood serum protein, transports hormones and fatty acids, buffers pH, and maintains osmotic pressures.
7.40.180	Immunoglobin is a protein antibody produced in the mucosal lining and plays an important role in antibody mediated immunity.
7.40.181	The heart is a complex muscle that pumps blood through the three divisions of the circulatory system: the coronary (vessels that serve the heart), pulmonary (heart and lungs), and systemic (systems of the body), as shown in Figure 40.10.
7.40.182	Coronary circulation intrinsic to the heart takes blood directly from the main artery (aorta) coming from the heart.
7.40.183	For pulmonary and systemic circulation, the heart has to pump blood to the lungs or the rest of the body, respectively.
7.40.184	In vertebrates, the lungs are relatively close to the heart in the thoracic cavity.
7.40.185	The shorter distance to pump means that the muscle wall on the right side of the heart is not as thick as the left side which must have enough pressure to pump blood all the way to your big toe.
7.40.186	Structure of the Heart
7.40.187	The heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic circuits.
7.40.188	Since the right side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to the whole body in the systemic circuit, as shown in Figure 40.11.
7.40.189	In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles.
7.40.190	There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side.
7.40.191	The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood.
7.40.192	The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs.
7.40.193	In addition, the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself.
7.40.194	This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the backflow of blood.
7.40.195	The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve.
7.40.196	After it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, by-passing the semilunar valve (or pulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation.
7.40.197	After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries, the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle.
7.40.198	The left atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins.
7.40.199	This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through aorta, the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body.
7.40.200	Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle.
7.40.201	This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals.
7.40.202	The heart is composed of three layers; the epicardium, the myocardium, and the endocardium, illustrated in Figure 40.11.
7.40.203	The inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium.
7.40.204	The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall.
7.40.205	The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium, of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures.
7.40.206	The heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood.
7.40.207	The coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown.
7.40.208	They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re-oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit.
7.40.209	The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood.
7.40.210	Atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques.
7.40.211	Because of the size (narrow) of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself, atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries.
7.40.212	The slowdown of blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain, known as angina, and complete blockage of the arteries will cause myocardial infarction: the death of cardiac muscle tissue, commonly known as a heart attack.
7.40.213	The Cardiac Cycle
7.40.214	The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle.
7.40.215	The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax.
7.40.216	The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day.
7.40.217	In each cardiac cycle, the heart contracts ( systole), pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase ( diastole), where the heart fills with blood, as illustrated in Figure 40.12.
7.40.218	The atria contract at the same time, forcing blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles.
7.40.219	Closing of the atrioventricular valves produces a monosyllabic “lup” sound.
7.40.220	Following a brief delay, the ventricles contract at the same time forcing blood through the semilunar valves into the aorta and the artery transporting blood to the lungs (via the pulmonary artery).
7.40.221	Closing of the semilunar valves produces a monosyllabic “dup” sound.
7.40.222	During (a) cardiac diastole, the heart muscle is relaxed and blood flows into the heart.
7.40.223	During (b) atrial systole, the atria contract, pushing blood into the ventricles.
7.40.224	During (c) atrial diastole, the ventricles contract, forcing blood out of the heart.
7.40.225	The pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, that make up the heart muscle.
7.40.226	Cardiomyocytes, shown in Figure 40.13, are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle; they are connected by intercalated disks exclusive to cardiac muscle.
7.40.227	They are self-stimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat if given the correct balance of nutrients and electrolytes.
7.40.228	Cardiomyocytes are striated muscle cells found in cardiac tissue.
7.40.229	(credit: modification of work by Dr. S. Girod, Anton Becker; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
7.40.230	The autonomous beating of cardiac muscle cells is regulated by the heart’s internal pacemaker that uses electrical signals to time the beating of the heart.
7.40.231	The electrical signals and mechanical actions, illustrated in Figure 40.14, are intimately intertwined.
7.40.232	The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located near the wall of the right atrium.
7.40.233	Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison.
7.40.234	The pulse reaches a second node, called the atrioventricular (AV) node, between the right atrium and right ventricle where it pauses for approximately 0.1 second before spreading to the walls of the ventricles.
7.40.235	From the AV node, the electrical impulse enters the bundle of His, then to the left and right bundle branches extending through the interventricular septum.
7.40.236	Finally, the Purkinje fibers conduct the impulse from the apex of the heart up the ventricular myocardium, and then the ventricles contract.
7.40.237	This pause allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood.
7.40.238	The electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes.
7.40.239	This information can be observed as an electrocardiogram (ECG)—a recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle.
7.40.240	The beating of the heart is regulated by an electrical impulse that causes the characteristic reading of an ECG.
7.40.241	The signal is initiated at the sinoatrial valve.
7.40.242	The signal then (a) spreads to the atria, causing them to contract.
7.40.243	The signal is (b) delayed at the atrioventricular node before it is passed on to the (c) heart apex.
7.40.244	The delay allows the atria to relax before the (d) ventricles contract.
7.40.245	The final part of the ECG cycle prepares the heart for the next beat.
7.40.246	Arteries, Veins, and Capillaries
7.40.247	The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels (Figure 40.15).
7.40.248	Arteries take blood away from the heart.
7.40.249	The main artery is the aorta that branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs.
7.40.250	These major arteries include the carotid artery that takes blood to the brain, the brachial arteries that take blood to the arms, and the thoracic artery that takes blood to the thorax and then into the hepatic, renal, and gastric arteries for the liver, kidney, and stomach, respectively.
7.40.251	The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs.
7.40.252	The major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and then smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body.
7.40.253	The major human arteries and veins are shown.
7.40.254	(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
7.40.255	Arterioles diverge into capillary beds.
7.40.256	Capillary beds contain a large number (10 to 100) of capillaries that branch among the cells and tissues of the body.
7.40.257	Capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level.
7.40.258	Fluid also crosses into the interstitial space from the capillaries.
7.40.259	The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart.
7.40.260	Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart.
7.40.261	The major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply.
7.40.262	Fluid is also brought back to the heart via the lymphatic system.
7.40.263	The structure of the different types of blood vessels reflects their function or layers.
7.40.264	There are three distinct layers, or tunics, that form the walls of blood vessels (Figure 40.16).
7.40.265	The first tunic is a smooth, inner lining of endothelial cells that are in contact with the red blood cells.
7.40.266	The endothelial tunic is continuous with the endocardium of the heart.
7.40.267	In capillaries, this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells, as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis.
7.40.268	The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by vasoconstriction, narrowing of the blood vessels, and vasodilation, widening of the blood vessels; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure.
7.40.269	Veins and arteries both have two further tunics that surround the endothelium: the middle tunic is composed of smooth muscle and the outermost layer is connective tissue (collagen and elastic fibers).
7.40.270	The elastic connective tissue stretches and supports the blood vessels, and the smooth muscle layer helps regulate blood flow by altering vascular resistance through vasoconstriction and vasodilation.
7.40.271	The arteries have thicker smooth muscle and connective tissue than the veins to accommodate the higher pressure and speed of freshly pumped blood.
7.40.272	The veins are thinner walled as the pressure and rate of flow are much lower.
7.40.273	In addition, veins are structurally different than arteries in that veins have valves to prevent the backflow of blood.
7.40.274	Because veins have to work against gravity to get blood back to the heart, contraction of skeletal muscle assists with the flow of blood back to the heart.
7.40.275	Arteries and veins consist of three layers: an outer tunica externa, a middle tunica media, and an inner tunica intima.
7.40.276	Capillaries consist of a single layer of epithelial cells, the tunica intima.
7.40.277	(credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH)
7.40.278	Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of a blood vessel that helps to push blood through the body.
7.40.279	Systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while the heart is beating.
7.40.280	The optimal systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg.
7.40.281	Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the vessels between heartbeats.
7.40.282	The optimal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg.
7.40.283	Many factors can affect blood pressure, such as hormones, stress, exercise, eating, sitting, and standing.
7.40.284	Blood flow through the body is regulated by the size of blood vessels, by the action of smooth muscle, by one-way valves, and by the fluid pressure of the blood itself.
7.40.285	How Blood Flows Through the Body Blood is pushed through the body by the action of the pumping heart.
7.40.286	With each rhythmic pump, blood is pushed under high pressure and velocity away from the heart, initially along the main artery, the aorta.
7.40.287	In the aorta, the blood travels at 30 cm/sec.
7.40.288	As blood moves into the arteries, arterioles, and ultimately to the capillary beds, the rate of movement slows dramatically to about 0.026 cm/sec, one-thousand times slower than the rate of movement in the aorta.
7.40.289	While the diameter of each individual arteriole and capillary is far narrower than the diameter of the aorta, and according to the law of continuity, fluid should travel faster through a narrower diameter tube, the rate is actually slower due to the overall diameter of all the combined capillaries being far greater than the diameter of the individual aorta.
7.40.290	The slow rate of travel through the capillary beds, which reach almost every cell in the body, assists with gas and nutrient exchange and also promotes the diffusion of fluid into the interstitial space.
7.40.291	After the blood has passed through the capillary beds to the venules, veins, and finally to the main venae cavae, the rate of flow increases again but is still much slower than the initial rate in the aorta.
7.40.292	Blood primarily moves in the veins by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves.
7.40.293	Because most veins must move blood against the pull of gravity, blood is prevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves.
7.40.294	Because skeletal muscle contraction aids in venous blood flow, it is important to get up and move frequently after long periods of sitting so that blood will not pool in the extremities.
7.40.295	Blood flow through the capillary beds is regulated depending on the body’s needs and is directed by nerve and hormone signals.
7.40.296	For example, after a large meal, most of the blood is diverted to the stomach by vasodilation of vessels of the digestive system and vasoconstriction of other vessels.
7.40.297	During exercise, blood is diverted to the skeletal muscles through vasodilation while blood to the digestive system would be lessened through vasoconstriction.
7.40.298	The blood entering some capillary beds is controlled by small muscles, called precapillary sphincters, illustrated in Figure 40.17.
7.40.299	If the sphincters are open, the blood will flow into the associated branches of the capillary blood.
7.40.300	If all of the sphincters are closed, then the blood will flow directly from the arteriole to the venule through the thoroughfare channel (see Figure 40.17).
7.40.301	These muscles allow the body to precisely control when capillary beds receive blood flow.
7.40.302	At any given moment only about 5-10% of our capillary beds actually have blood flowing through them.
7.40.303	Proteins and other large solutes cannot leave the capillaries.
7.40.304	The loss of the watery plasma creates a hyperosmotic solution within the capillaries, especially near the venules.
7.40.305	This causes about 85% of the plasma that leaves the capillaries to eventually diffuses back into the capillaries near the venules.
7.40.306	The remaining 15% of blood plasma drains out from the interstitial fluid into nearby lymphatic vessels (Figure 40.18).
7.40.307	The fluid in the lymph is similar in composition to the interstitial fluid.
7.40.308	The lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava.
7.40.309	Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells.
7.40.310	The white blood cells remove infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses, to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream.
7.40.311	After it is cleaned, the lymph returns to the heart by the action of smooth muscle pumping, skeletal muscle action, and one-way valves joining the returning blood near the junction of the venae cavae entering the right atrium of the heart.
7.40.312	Fluid from the capillaries moves into the interstitial space and lymph capillaries by diffusion down a pressure gradient and also by osmosis.
7.40.313	Out of 7,200 liters of fluid pumped by the average heart in a day, over 1,500 liters is filtered.
7.40.314	(credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH)
7.40.315	Blood Pressure
7.40.316	The pressure of the blood flow in the body is produced by the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid (blood) against the walls of the blood vessels.
7.40.317	Fluid will move from areas of high to low hydrostatic pressures.
7.40.318	In the arteries, the hydrostatic pressure near the heart is very high and blood flows to the arterioles where the rate of flow is slowed by the narrow openings of the arterioles.
7.40.319	During systole, when new blood is entering the arteries, the artery walls stretch to accommodate the increase of pressure of the extra blood; during diastole, the walls return to normal because of their elastic properties.
7.40.320	The blood pressure of the systole phase and the diastole phase, graphed in Figure 40.19, gives the two pressure readings for blood pressure.
7.40.321	For example, 120/80 indicates a reading of 120 mm Hg during the systole and 80 mm Hg during diastole.
7.40.322	Throughout the cardiac cycle, the blood continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate.
7.40.323	This resistance to blood flow is called peripheral resistance.
7.40.324	Figure 40.19
7.40.325	Blood pressure is related to the blood velocity in the arteries and arterioles.
7.40.326	In the capillaries and veins, the blood pressure continues to decease but velocity increases.
7.40.327	Blood Pressure Regulation Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute.
7.40.328	It is calculated by multiplying the number of heart contractions that occur per minute (heart rate) times the stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per contraction of the left ventricle).
7.40.329	Therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising.
7.40.330	However, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater strength.
7.40.331	Stroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the heart between contractions.
7.40.332	During heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased heart rate and ensuring adequate oxygenated blood gets to the muscles.
7.40.333	Stress triggers a decrease in the diameter of the blood vessels, consequently increasing blood pressure.
7.40.334	These changes can also be caused by nerve signals or hormones, and even standing up or lying down can have a great effect on blood pressure.  
7.41.0	Just as humans recycle what we can and dump the remains into landfills, our bodies use and recycle what they can and excrete the remaining waste products.
7.41.1	Our bodies’ complex systems have developed ways to treat waste and maintain a balanced internal environment.

7.41.3	Introduction
7.41.4	The daily intake recommendation for human water consumption is eight to ten glasses of water.
7.41.5	In order to achieve a healthy balance, the human body should excrete the eight to ten glasses of water every day.
7.41.6	This occurs via the processes of urination, defecation, sweating and, to a small extent, respiration.
7.41.7	The organs and tissues of the human body are soaked in fluids that are maintained at constant temperature, pH, and solute concentration, all crucial elements of homeostasis.
7.41.8	The solutes in body fluids are mainly mineral salts and sugars, and osmotic regulation is the process by which the mineral salts and water are kept in balance.
7.41.9	Osmotic homeostasis is maintained despite the influence of external factors like temperature, diet, and weather conditions.
7.41.10	Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane.
7.41.11	Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance) across membranes within the body’s fluids, which are composed of water, plus electrolytes and non-electrolytes.
7.41.12	An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water.
7.41.13	A non-electrolyte, in contrast, doesn’t dissociate into ions during water dissolution.
7.41.14	Both electrolytes and non-electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance.
7.41.15	The body’s fluids include blood plasma, the cytosol within cells, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body.
7.41.16	The membranes of the body (such as the pleural, serous, and cell membranes) are semi-permeable membranes.
7.41.17	Semi-permeable membranes are permeable (or permissive) to certain types of solutes and water.
7.41.18	Solutions on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by movement of solutes and/or water across the membrane.
7.41.19	As seen in Figure 41.2, a cell placed in water tends to swell due to gain of water from the hypotonic or “low salt” environment.
7.41.20	A cell placed in a solution with higher salt concentration, on the other hand, tends to make the membrane shrivel up due to loss of water into the hypertonic or “high salt” environment.
7.41.21	Isotonic cells have an equal concentration of solutes inside and outside the cell; this equalizes the osmotic pressure on either side of the cell membrane which is a semi-permeable membrane.
7.41.22	Cells placed in a hypertonic environment tend to shrink due to loss of water.
7.41.23	In a hypotonic environment, cells tend to swell due to intake of water.
7.41.24	The blood maintains an isotonic environment so that cells neither shrink nor swell.

7.41.26	The body does not exist in isolation.
7.41.27	There is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system.
7.41.28	While osmoregulation is achieved across membranes within the body, excess electrolytes and wastes are transported to the kidneys and excreted, helping to maintain osmotic balance.
7.41.29	Need for
7.41.30	Osmoregulation Biological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of food and water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces.
7.41.31	Without a mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure, or when a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can have dire consequences.
7.41.32	Mammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific concentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular fluid.
7.41.33	Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid compartments can also change temporarily.
7.41.34	Because blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a direct bearing on blood pressure.
7.41.35	Transport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes Electrolytes, such as sodium chloride, ionize in water, meaning that they dissociate into their component ions.
7.41.36	In water, sodium chloride (NaCl), dissociates into the sodium ion (Na+) and the chloride ion (Cl–).
7.41.37	The most important ions, whose concentrations are very closely regulated in body fluids, are the cations sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), and the anions chloride (Cl-), carbonate (CO3-2), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and phosphate(PO3-).
7.41.38	Electrolytes are lost from the body during urination and perspiration.
7.41.39	For this reason, athletes are encouraged to replace electrolytes and fluids during periods of increased activity and perspiration.
7.41.40	Osmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution.
7.41.41	It is directly proportional to the number of solute atoms or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules.
7.41.42	Because electrolytes dissociate into their component ions, they, in essence, add more solute particles into the solution and have a greater effect on osmotic pressure, per mass than compounds that do not dissociate in water, such as glucose.
7.41.43	Water can pass through membranes by passive diffusion.
7.41.44	If electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across membranes, it would be impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment therefore they require special mechanisms to cross the semi-permeable membranes in the body.
7.41.45	This movement can be accomplished by facilitated diffusion and active transport.
7.41.46	Facilitated diffusion requires protein-based channels for moving the solute.
7.41.47	Active transport requires energy in the form of ATP conversion, carrier proteins, or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration gradient.
7.41.48	Concept of Osmolality and Milliequivalent
7.41.49	In order to calculate osmotic pressure, it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured.
7.41.50	The unit for measuring solutes is the mole.
7.41.51	One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute.
7.41.52	For example, the molecular weight of sodium chloride is 58.44.
7.41.53	Thus, one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams.
7.41.54	The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.
7.41.55	The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.
7.41.56	If the solvent is water, one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water.
7.41.57	While molarity and molality are used to express the concentration of solutions, electrolyte concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L):
7.41.58	the mEq/L is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by the number of electrical charges on the ion.
7.41.59	The unit of milliequivalent takes into consideration the ions present in the solution (since electrolytes form ions in aqueous solutions) and the charge on the ions.
7.41.60	Thus, for ions that have a charge of one, one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole.
7.41.61	For ions that have a charge of two (like calcium), one milliequivalent is equal to 0.5 millimoles.
7.41.62	Another unit for the expression of electrolyte concentration is the milliosmole (mOsm), which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per kilogram of solvent.
7.41.63	Body fluids are usually maintained within the range of 280 to 300 mOsm.
7.41.64	Osmoregulators and Osmoconformers Persons lost at sea without any fresh water to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt to drinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids.
7.41.65	Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only a relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline.
7.41.66	About 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either freshwater or seawater.
7.41.67	They are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment.
7.41.68	It is possible, however, for a few fishes like salmon to spend part of their life in fresh water and part in sea water.
7.41.69	Organisms like the salmon and molly that can tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms.
7.41.70	This is possible because some fish have evolved osmoregulatory mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments.
7.41.71	When they live in fresh water, their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic, as illustrated in Figure 41.3a.
7.41.72	In such hypotonic environments, these fish do not drink much water.
7.41.73	Instead, they pass a lot of very dilute urine, and they achieve electrolyte balance by active transport of salts through the gills.
7.41.74	When they move to a hypertonic marine environment, these fish start drinking sea water; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine, as illustrated in Figure 41.3b.
7.41.75	Most marine invertebrates, on the other hand, may be isotonic with sea water ( osmoconformers).
7.41.76	Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration.
7.41.77	Cartilaginous fishes’ salt composition of the blood is similar to bony fishes; however, the blood of sharks contains the organic compounds urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO).
7.41.78	This does not mean that their electrolyte composition is similar to that of sea water.
7.41.79	They achieve isotonicity with the sea by storing large concentrations of urea.
7.41.80	These animals that secrete urea are called ureotelic animals.
7.41.81	TMAO stabilizes proteins in the presence of high urea levels, preventing the disruption of peptide bonds that would occur in other animals exposed to similar levels of urea.
7.41.82	Sharks are cartilaginous fish with a rectal gland to secrete salt and assist in osmoregulation.
7.41.83	Fish are osmoregulators, but must use different mechanisms to survive in (a) freshwater or (b) saltwater environments.

7.41.85	Although the kidneys are the major osmoregulatory organ, the skin and lungs also play a role in the process.
7.41.86	Water and electrolytes are lost through sweat glands in the skin, which helps moisturize and cool the skin surface, while the lungs expel a small amount of water in the form of mucous secretions and via evaporation of water vapor.
7.41.87	Kidneys:
7.41.88	The Main Osmoregulatory Organ
7.41.89	The kidneys, illustrated in Figure 41.4, are a pair of bean-shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity.
7.41.90	The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands.
7.41.91	Kidneys filter blood and purify it.
7.41.92	All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use up almost 25 percent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function.
7.41.93	Oxygen allows the kidney cells to efficiently manufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through aerobic respiration.
7.41.94	The filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called urine.
7.41.95	Kidneys filter the blood, producing urine that is stored in the bladder prior to elimination through the urethra.
7.41.96	(credit: modification of work by NCI)
7.41.97	Kidney Structure
7.41.98	Externally, the kidneys are surrounded by three layers, illustrated in Figure 41.5.
7.41.99	The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia.
7.41.100	The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule, which helps anchor the kidneys in place.
7.41.101	The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule.
7.41.102	Internally, the kidney has three regions—an outer cortex, a medulla in the middle, and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney.
7.41.103	The hilum is the concave part of the bean-shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney; it is also the point of exit for the ureters.
7.41.104	The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons—the functional unit of the kidney.
7.41.105	The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses, called the renal pyramids.
7.41.106	In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass.
7.41.107	The tips of the pyramids, called renal papillae, point toward the renal pelvis.
7.41.108	There are, on average, eight renal pyramids in each kidney.
7.41.109	The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney.
7.41.110	The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney.
7.41.111	On the inside of the kidney, the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces, which further branch into the minor calyces.
7.41.112	The ureters are urine-bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder.
7.41.113	Because the kidney filters blood, its network of blood vessels is an important component of its structure and function.
7.41.114	The arteries, veins, and nerves that supply the kidney enter and exit at the renal hilum.
7.41.115	Renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries (which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through) and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava.
7.41.116	The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys.
7.41.117	Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns, which supply the renal lobes.
7.41.118	The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries.
7.41.119	The arcuate “bow shaped” arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids.
7.41.120	Cortical radiate arteries, as the name suggests, radiate out from the arcuate arteries.
7.41.121	The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent arterioles, and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons.
7.41.122	Veins trace the path of the arteries and have similar names, except there are no segmental veins.
7.41.123	As mentioned previously, the functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, illustrated in Figure 41.6.
7.41.124	Each kidney is made up of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex, giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally.
7.41.125	There are two types of nephrons— cortical nephrons (85 percent), which are deep in the renal cortex, and juxtamedullary nephrons (15 percent), which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla.
7.41.126	A nephron consists of three parts—a renal corpuscle, a renal tubule, and the associated capillary network, which originates from the cortical radiate arteries.
7.41.127	Renal Corpuscle
7.41.128	The renal corpuscle, located in the renal cortex, is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the capsule, a cup-shaped chamber that surrounds it, called the glomerular or Bowman's capsule.
7.41.129	Renal Tubule
7.41.130	The renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts based on function.
7.41.131	The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) due to its proximity to the glomerulus; it stays in the renal cortex.
7.41.132	The second part is called the loop of Henle, or nephritic loop, because it forms a loop (with descending and ascending limbs) that goes through the renal medulla.
7.41.133	The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex.
7.41.134	The DCT, which is the last part of the nephron, connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids.
7.41.135	The collecting ducts amass contents from multiple nephrons and fuse together as they enter the papillae of the renal medulla.
7.41.136	Capillary Network within the Nephron
7.41.137	The capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered.
7.41.138	The branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole.
7.41.139	The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole.
7.41.140	Within the glomerulus, the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed.
7.41.141	Once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus, it forms the peritubular capillary network, which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule.
7.41.142	In cortical nephrons, the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT.
7.41.143	In juxtamedullary nephrons, the peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta.
7.41.144	Kidney Function and Physiology Kidneys filter blood in a three-step process.
7.41.145	First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus.
7.41.146	Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular filtration.
7.41.147	Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules.
7.41.148	Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption.
7.41.149	In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network.
7.41.150	Water is also reabsorbed during this step.
7.41.151	Then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption.
7.41.152	The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae.
7.41.153	From here, the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis.
7.41.154	This entire process is illustrated in Figure 41.7.
7.41.155	Each part of the nephron performs a different function in filtering waste and maintaining homeostatic balance.
7.41.156	(1)
7.41.157	The glomerulus forces small solutes out of the blood by pressure.
7.41.158	(2)
7.41.159	The proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid, and actively transports toxins and drugs from the interstitial fluid into the filtrate.
7.41.160	The proximal convoluted tubule also adjusts blood pH by selectively secreting ammonia (NH3) into the filtrate, where it reacts with H+ to form NH4+.
7.41.161	The more acidic the filtrate, the more ammonia is secreted.
7.41.162	(3)
7.41.163	The descending loop of Henle is lined with cells containing aquaporins that allow water to pass from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid.
7.41.164	(4)
7.41.165	In the thin part of the ascending loop of Henle, Na+ and Cl- ions diffuse into the interstitial fluid.
7.41.166	In the thick part, these same ions are actively transported into the interstitial fluid.
7.41.167	Because salt but not water is lost, the filtrate becomes more dilute as it travels up the limb.
7.41.168	(5)
7.41.169	In the distal convoluted tubule, K+ and H+ ions are selectively secreted into the filtrate, while Na+, Cl-, and
7.41.170	HCO3- ions are reabsorbed to maintain pH and electrolyte balance in the blood.
7.41.171	(6)
7.41.172	The collecting duct reabsorbs solutes and water from the filtrate, forming dilute urine.
7.41.173	(credit: modification of work by NIDDK)
7.41.174	Glomerular Filtration Glomerular filtration filters out most of the solutes due to high blood pressure and specialized membranes in the afferent arteriole.
7.41.175	The blood pressure in the glomerulus is maintained independent of factors that affect systemic blood pressure.
7.41.176	The “leaky” connections between the endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary network allow solutes to pass through easily.
7.41.177	All solutes in the glomerular capillaries, except for macromolecules like proteins, pass through by passive diffusion.
7.41.178	There is no energy requirement at this stage of the filtration process.
7.41.179	Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of glomerular filtrate formed per minute by the kidneys.
7.41.180	GFR is regulated by multiple mechanisms and is an important indicator of kidney function.
7.41.181	Tubular Reabsorption and Secretion Tubular reabsorption occurs in the PCT part of the renal tubule.
7.41.182	Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either by passive or active transport.
7.41.183	Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by hormones.
7.41.184	Sodium (Na+) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to the peritubular capillaries.
7.41.185	Because Na+ is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure.
7.41.186	Water is also independently reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water channels, in the PCT.
7.41.187	This occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries.
7.41.188	However, every solute has a transport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed.
7.41.189	In the loop of Henle, the permeability of the membrane changes.
7.41.190	The descending limb is permeable to water, not solutes; the opposite is true for the ascending limb.
7.41.191	Additionally, the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally high in salt concentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate the filtrate.
7.41.192	The osmotic gradient increases as it moves deeper into the medulla.
7.41.193	Because two sides of the loop of Henle perform opposing functions, as illustrated in Figure 41.8, it acts as a countercurrent multiplier.
7.41.194	The vasa recta around it acts as the countercurrent exchanger.
7.41.195	By the time the filtrate reaches the DCT, most of the urine and solutes have been reabsorbed.
7.41.196	If the body requires additional water, all of it can be reabsorbed at this point.
7.41.197	Further reabsorption is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed in a later section.
7.41.198	Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion.
7.41.199	Undesirable products like metabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion.
7.41.200	Most of the tubular secretion happens in the DCT, but some occurs in the early part of the collecting duct.
7.41.201	Kidneys also maintain an acid-base balance by secreting excess H+ ions.
7.41.202	Although parts of the renal tubules are named proximal and distal, in a cross-section of the kidney, the tubules are placed close together and in contact with each other and the glomerulus.
7.41.203	This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types.
7.41.204	For example, the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called macula densa, which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells.
7.41.205	Together, the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex (JGC).
7.41.206	The JGC is an endocrine structure that secretes the enzyme renin and the hormone erythropoietin.
7.41.207	When hormones trigger the macula densa cells in the DCT due to variations in blood volume, blood pressure, or electrolyte balance, these cells can immediately communicate the problem to the capillaries in the afferent and efferent arterioles, which can constrict or relax to change the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys.
7.41.208	Microorganisms and invertebrate animals use more primitive and simple mechanisms to get rid of their metabolic wastes than the mammalian system of kidney and urinary function.
7.41.209	Three excretory systems evolved in organisms before complex kidneys: vacuoles, flame cells, and Malpighian tubules.
7.41.210	Contractile Vacuoles in Microorganisms
7.41.211	The most fundamental feature of life is the presence of a cell.
7.41.212	In other words, a cell is the simplest functional unit of a life.
7.41.213	Bacteria are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that have some of the least complex life processes in place; however, prokaryotes such as bacteria do not contain membrane-bound vacuoles.
7.41.214	The cells of microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, and fungi are bound by cell membranes and use them to interact with the environment.
7.41.215	Some cells, including some leucocytes in humans, are able to engulf food by endocytosis—the formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane within the cells.
7.41.216	The same vesicles are able to interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment.
7.41.217	In some unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as the amoeba, shown in Figure 41.9, cellular wastes and excess water are excreted by exocytosis, when the contractile vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and expel wastes into the environment.
7.41.218	Contractile vacuoles (CV) should not be confused with vacuoles, which store food or water.
7.41.219	Some unicellular organisms, such as the amoeba, ingest food by endocytosis.
7.41.220	The food vesicle fuses with a lysosome, which digests the food.
7.41.221	Waste is excreted by exocytosis.
7.41.222	Flame Cells of Planaria and Nephridia of Worms
7.41.223	As multi-cellular systems evolved to have organ systems that divided the metabolic needs of the body, individual organs evolved to perform the excretory function.
7.41.224	Planaria are flatworms that live in fresh water.
7.41.225	Their excretory system consists of two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system.
7.41.226	The cells in the tubules are called flame cells (or protonephridia) because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope, as illustrated in Figure 41.10a.
7.41.227	The cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface; cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid, allowing for filtration.
7.41.228	Any valuable metabolites are recovered by reabsorption.
7.41.229	Flame cells are found in flatworms, including parasitic tapeworms and free-living planaria.
7.41.230	They also maintain the organism’s osmotic balance.
7.41.231	In the excretory system of the (a) planaria, cilia of flame cells propel waste through a tubule formed by a tube cell.
7.41.232	Tubules are connected into branched structures that lead to pores located all along the sides of the body.
7.41.233	The filtrate is secreted through these pores.
7.41.234	In (b) annelids such as earthworms, nephridia filter fluid from the coelom, or body cavity.
7.41.235	Beating cilia at the opening of the nephridium draw water from the coelom into a tubule.
7.41.236	As the filtrate passes down the tubules, nutrients and other solutes are reabsorbed by capillaries.
7.41.237	Filtered fluid containing nitrogenous and other wastes is stored in a bladder and then secreted through a pore in the side of the body.
7.41.238	Earthworms (annelids) have slightly more evolved excretory structures called nephridia, illustrated in Figure 41.10b.
7.41.239	A pair of nephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm.
7.41.240	They are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule with cilia.
7.41.241	Excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore.
7.41.242	They are more evolved than the flame cells in that they have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion.
7.41.243	Malpighian Tubules of Insects Malpighian tubules are found lining the gut of some species of arthropods, such as the bee illustrated in Figure 41.11.
7.41.244	They are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect.
7.41.245	Malpighian tubules are convoluted, which increases their surface area, and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance.
7.41.246	Malpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum.
7.41.247	Body fluids are not filtered as in the case of nephridia; urine is produced by tubular secretion mechanisms by the cells lining the Malpighian tubules that are bathed in hemolymph (a mixture of blood and interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as most mollusks).
7.41.248	Metabolic wastes like uric acid freely diffuse into the tubules.
7.41.249	There are exchange pumps lining the tubules, which actively transport H+ ions into the cell and K+ or Na+ ions out; water passively follows to form urine.
7.41.250	The secretion of ions alters the osmotic pressure which draws water, electrolytes, and nitrogenous waste (uric acid) into the tubules.
7.41.251	Water and electrolytes are reabsorbed when these organisms are faced with low-water environments, and uric acid is excreted as a thick paste or powder.
7.41.252	Not dissolving wastes in water helps these organisms to conserve water; this is especially important for life in dry environments.
7.41.253	Malpighian tubules of insects and other terrestrial arthropods remove nitrogenous wastes and other solutes from the hemolymph.
7.41.254	Na+
7.41.255	and/or K+ ions are actively transported into the lumen of the tubules.
7.41.256	Water then enters the tubules via osmosis, forming urine.
7.41.257	The urine passes through the intestine, and into the rectum.
7.41.258	There, nutrients diffuse back into the hemolymph.
7.41.259	Na+
7.41.260	and/or K+ ions are pumped into the hemolymph, and water follows.
7.41.261	The concentrated waste is then excreted.
7.41.262	Of the four major macromolecules in biological systems, both proteins and nucleic acids contain nitrogen.
7.41.263	During the catabolism, or breakdown, of nitrogen-containing macromolecules, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are extracted and stored in the form of carbohydrates and fats.
7.41.264	Excess nitrogen is excreted from the body.
7.41.265	Nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia, which raises the pH of body fluids.
7.41.266	The formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities of water to dilute it out of a biological system.
7.41.267	Animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water.
7.41.268	Animals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic.
7.41.269	Terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete nitrogenous wastes.
7.41.270	The animals must detoxify ammonia by converting it into a relatively nontoxic form such as urea or uric acid.
7.41.271	Mammals, including humans, produce urea, whereas reptiles and many terrestrial invertebrates produce uric acid.
7.41.272	Animals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material are called ureotelic animals.
7.41.273	Nitrogenous Waste in Terrestrial Animals:
7.41.274	The Urea Cycle
7.41.275	The urea cycle is the primary mechanism by which mammals convert ammonia to urea.
7.41.276	Urea is made in the liver and excreted in urine.
7.41.277	The overall chemical reaction by which ammonia is converted to urea is 2 NH3 (ammonia)
7.41.278	+ CO2 + 3 ATP + H2O
7.41.279	→ H2N-CO-NH2 (urea) +
7.41.280	2 ADP +
7.41.281	4 Pi + AMP.
7.41.282	The urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps, catalyzed by five different enzymes, to convert ammonia to urea, as shown in Figure 41.12.
7.41.283	The amino acid L-ornithine gets converted into different intermediates before being regenerated at the end of the urea cycle.
7.41.284	Hence, the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle.
7.41.285	The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes a key step in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body.
7.41.286	The first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol.
7.41.287	Urea concentration in the blood, called blood urea nitrogen or BUN, is used as an indicator of kidney function.
7.41.288	Nitrogenous Waste in Birds and Reptiles:
7.41.289	Uric Acid Birds, reptiles, and most terrestrial arthropods convert toxic ammonia to uric acid or the closely related compound guanine (guano) instead of urea.
7.41.290	Mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids.
7.41.291	Uric acid is a compound similar to purines found in nucleic acids.
7.41.292	It is water insoluble and tends to form a white paste or powder; it is excreted by birds, insects, and reptiles.
7.41.293	Conversion of ammonia to uric acid requires more energy and is much more complex than conversion of ammonia to urea Figure 41.13.
7.41.294	Nitrogenous waste is excreted in different forms by different species.
7.41.295	These include (a) ammonia, (b) urea, and (c) uric acid.

7.41.297	While the kidneys operate to maintain osmotic balance and blood pressure in the body, they also act in concert with hormones.
7.41.298	Hormones are small molecules that act as messengers within the body.
7.41.299	Hormones are typically secreted from one cell and travel in the bloodstream to affect a target cell in another portion of the body.
7.41.300	Different regions of the nephron bear specialized cells that have receptors to respond to chemical messengers and hormones.
7.41.301	Table 41.1 summarizes the hormones that control the osmoregulatory functions.
7.41.302	Epinephrine and Norepinephrine Epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla and nervous system respectively.
7.41.303	They are the flight/ fight hormones that are released when the body is under extreme stress.
7.41.304	During stress, much of the body’s energy is used to combat imminent danger.
7.41.305	Kidney function is halted temporarily by epinephrine and norepinephrine.
7.41.306	These hormones function by acting directly on the smooth muscles of blood vessels to constrict them.
7.41.307	Once the afferent arterioles are constricted, blood flow into the nephrons stops.
7.41.308	These hormones go one step further and trigger the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system.
7.41.309	Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone
7.41.310	The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, illustrated in Figure 41.15 proceeds through several steps to produce angiotensin II, which acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume.
7.41.311	Renin (secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular complex) is produced by the granular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles.
7.41.312	Thus, the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly.
7.41.313	Renin acts on angiotensinogen, which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting
7.41.314	enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin
7.41.315	I to angiotensin II.
7.41.316	Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels.
7.41.317	It also triggers the release of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium.
7.41.318	Angiotensin II also triggers the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) from the hypothalamus, leading to water retention in the kidneys.
7.41.319	It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate.
7.41.320	Medically, blood pressure can be controlled by drugs that inhibit ACE (called ACE inhibitors).
7.41.321	The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increases blood pressure and volume.
7.41.322	The hormone ANP has antagonistic effects.
7.41.323	(credit: modification of work by Mikael Häggström)
7.41.324	Mineralocorticoids Mineralocorticoids are hormones synthesized by the adrenal cortex that affect osmotic balance.
7.41.325	Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid that regulates sodium levels in the blood.
7.41.326	Almost all of the sodium in the blood is reclaimed by the renal tubules under the influence of aldosterone.
7.41.327	Because sodium is always reabsorbed by active transport and water follows sodium to maintain osmotic balance, aldosterone manages not only sodium levels but also the water levels in body fluids.
7.41.328	In contrast, the aldosterone also stimulates potassium secretion concurrently with sodium reabsorption.
7.41.329	In contrast, absence of aldosterone means that no sodium gets reabsorbed in the renal tubules and all of it gets excreted in the urine.
7.41.330	In addition, the daily dietary potassium load is not secreted and the retention of K+ can cause a dangerous increase in plasma K+ concentration.
7.41.331	Patients who have Addison's disease have a failing adrenal cortex and cannot produce aldosterone.
7.41.332	They lose sodium in their urine constantly, and if the supply is not replenished, the consequences can be fatal.
7.41.333	Antidiurectic Hormone
7.41.334	As previously discussed, antidiuretic hormone or ADH (also called vasopressin), as the name suggests, helps the body conserve water when body fluid volume, especially that of blood, is low.
7.41.335	It is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and released from the posterior pituitary.
7.41.336	It acts by inserting aquaporins in the collecting ducts and promotes reabsorption of water.
7.41.337	ADH also acts as a vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure during hemorrhaging.
7.41.338	Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Hormone
7.41.339	The atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator.
7.41.340	It is released by cells in the atrium of the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea.
7.41.341	ANP affects salt release, and because water passively follows salt to maintain osmotic balance, it also has a diuretic effect.
7.41.342	ANP also prevents sodium reabsorption by the renal tubules, decreasing water reabsorption (thus acting as a diuretic) and lowering blood pressure.
7.41.343	Its actions suppress the actions of aldosterone, ADH, and renin.
7.42.0	In this compound light micrograph purple-stained neutrophil (upper left) and eosinophil (lower right) are white blood cells that float among red blood cells in this blood smear.
7.42.1	Neutrophils provide an early, rapid, and nonspecific defense against invading pathogens.
7.42.2	Eosinophils play a variety of roles in the immune response.
7.42.3	Red blood cells are about 7–8 μm in diameter, and a neutrophil is about 10–12μm.
7.42.4	The environment consists of numerous pathogens, which are agents, usually microorganisms, that cause diseases in their hosts.
7.42.5	A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen.
7.42.6	Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi and other infectious organisms.
7.42.7	We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air.
7.42.8	Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these disease agents.
7.42.9	Components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens.
7.42.10	When pathogens are found, immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection.
7.42.11	The immune factors identify the nature of the pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently, and then halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage.
7.42.12	The immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient response upon re-exposure.
7.42.13	This memory can last several decades.
7.42.14	Features of the immune system, such as pathogen identification, specific response, amplification, retreat, and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens.
7.42.15	The immune response can be classified as either innate or active.
7.42.16	The innate immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specific ones.
7.42.17	Conversely, the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific defenses.
7.42.18	Innate Immune Response
7.42.19	By the end of this section, you will be able to:
7.42.20	Describe physical and chemical immune barriers Explain immediate and induced innate immune responses Discuss natural killer cells Describe major histocompatibility class
7.42.21	I molecules
7.42.22	Summarize how the proteins in a complement system function to destroy extracellular pathogens
7.42.23	The immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses.
7.42.24	Innate immunity occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response.
7.42.25	Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated signaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication.
7.42.26	The innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly a billion years ago, as an essential response to infection.
7.42.27	Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any pathogenic threat triggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection independently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response.
7.42.28	For example, tears and mucus secretions contain microbicidal factors.
7.42.29	Physical and Chemical Barriers
7.42.30	Before any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to potentially infectious pathogens.
7.42.31	Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out) and by the skin’s acidity.
7.42.32	In addition, beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens, preventing infection.
7.42.33	Regions of the body that are not protected by skin (such as the eyes and mucus membranes) have alternative methods of defense, such as tears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away pathogens, and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus with the pathogens out of the body.
7.42.34	Throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low pH of the stomach (which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes, and the process of urination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract).
7.42.35	Despite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia.
7.42.36	Some pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms that allow them to overcome physical and chemical barriers.
7.42.37	When pathogens do enter the body, the innate immune system responds with inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of immune factors and proteins.
7.42.38	Pathogen Recognition
7.42.39	An infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen.
7.42.40	All viruses infect cells and replicate within those cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly, depending on the species.
7.42.41	The innate immune system must respond accordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/ or by identifying host cells that have already been infected.
7.42.42	When a pathogen enters the body, cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the pathogen’s surface.
7.42.43	PAMPs are carbohydrate, polypeptide, and nucleic acid “
7.42.44	signatures” that are expressed by viruses, bacteria, and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells.
7.42.45	The immune system has specific cells, described in Figure 42.2 and shown in Figure 42.3, with receptors that recognize these PAMPs.
7.42.46	A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens.
7.42.47	Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
7.42.48	PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment.
7.42.49	A monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue.
7.42.50	Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction.
7.42.51	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a type of PRR that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules).
7.42.52	TLRs are present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates, and appear to be one of the most ancient components of the immune system.
7.42.53	TLRs have also been identified in the mammalian nervous system.
7.42.54	The characteristics and location of cells involved in the innate immune system are described.
7.42.55	Cells of the blood include (1) monocytes, (2) lymphocytes, (3) neutrophils, (4) red blood cells, and (5) platelets.
7.42.56	Note the very similar morphologies of the leukocytes (1, 2, 3).
7.42.57	Cytokine Release Affect The binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines, which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to be destroyed along with any infected cells.
7.42.58	A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and function), proliferation (production), and gene expression to affect immune responses.
7.42.59	At least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them, the cell type that responds to them, and the changes they produce.
7.42.60	One type cytokine, interferon, is illustrated in Figure 42.4.
7.42.61	One subclass of cytokines is the interleukin (IL), so named because they mediate interactions between leukocytes (white blood cells).
7.42.62	Interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses.
7.42.63	In addition to being released from cells after PAMP recognition, cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and induce those cells to release cytokines, which results in a cytokine burst.
7.42.64	A second class of early-acting cytokines is interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells.
7.42.65	One of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication.
7.42.66	They also have other important functions, such as tumor surveillance.
7.42.67	Interferons work by signaling neighboring uninfected cells to destroy RNA and reduce protein synthesis, signaling neighboring infected cells to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), and activating immune cells.
7.42.68	In response to interferons, uninfected cells alter their gene expression, which increases the cells’ resistance to infection.
7.42.69	One effect of interferon-induced gene expression is a sharply reduced cellular protein synthesis.
7.42.70	Virally infected cells produce more viruses by synthesizing large quantities of viral proteins.
7.42.71	Thus, by reducing protein synthesis, a cell becomes resistant to viral infection.
7.42.72	Interferons are cytokines that are released by a cell infected with a virus.
7.42.73	Response of neighboring cells to interferon helps stem the infection.
7.42.74	Phagocytosis and Inflammation
7.42.75	The first cytokines to be produced are pro-inflammatory; that is, they encourage inflammation, the localized redness, swelling, heat, and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection.
7.42.76	The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen.
7.42.77	Both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis.
7.42.78	A neutrophil is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens.
7.42.79	Neutrophils, shown in Figure 42.3, are the most abundant leukocytes of the immune system.
7.42.80	Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes, and they contain organelles, called lysosomes, that digest engulfed pathogens.
7.42.81	An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes (parasitic worms).
7.42.82	Neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi.
7.42.83	A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens.
7.42.84	A basophil is a leukocyte that, like a neutrophil, releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in Figure 42.5.
7.42.85	Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses.
7.42.86	Eosinophils and basophils produce additional inflammatory mediators to recruit more leukocytes.
7.42.87	A hypersensitive immune response to harmless antigens, such as in pollen, often involves the release of histamine by basophils and mast cells.
7.42.88	In response to a cut, mast cells secrete histamines that cause nearby capillaries to dilate.
7.42.89	Neutrophils and monocytes leave the capillaries.
7.42.90	Monocytes mature into macrophages.
7.42.91	Neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages release chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response.
7.42.92	Neutrophils and macrophages also consume invading bacteria by phagocytosis.
7.42.93	Cytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling sick, which include lethargy, muscle pain, and nausea.
7.42.94	These effects may have evolved because the symptoms encourage the individual to rest and prevent them from spreading the infection to others.
7.42.95	Cytokines also increase the core body temperature, causing a fever, which causes the liver to withhold iron from the blood.
7.42.96	Without iron, certain pathogens, such as some bacteria, are unable to replicate; this is called nutritional immunity.
7.42.97	Natural Killer Cells Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large, darkly staining nuclei; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm, as shown in Figure 42.6.
7.42.98	Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer (NK) cells, lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells (abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue).
7.42.99	T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes.
7.42.100	T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland, and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow.
7.42.101	NK cells identify intracellular infections, especially from viruses, by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class (MHC)
7.42.102	I molecules on the surface of infected cells.
7.42.103	MHC
7.42.104	I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells, thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non-nucleated.
7.42.105	The function of MHC I molecules is to display fragments of proteins from the infectious agents within the cell to T-cells; healthy cells will be ignored, while “non-self” or foreign proteins will be attacked by the immune system.
7.42.106	MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens (“non-self proteins”) and on lymphocytes.
7.42.107	MHC II molecules interact with helper T-cells to trigger the appropriate immune response, which may include the inflammatory response.
7.42.108	Lymphocytes, such as NK cells, are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb Wright stain and therefore appear dark colored under a microscope.
7.42.109	An infected cell (or a tumor cell) is usually incapable of synthesizing and displaying MHC
7.42.110	I molecules appropriately.
7.42.111	The metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with MHC I processing and/ or trafficking to the cell surface.
7.42.112	The reduced MHC I on host cells varies from virus to virus and results from active inhibitors being produced by the viruses.
7.42.113	This process can deplete host MHC
7.42.114	I molecules on the cell surface, which NK cells detect as “unhealthy” or “abnormal” while searching for cellular MHC
7.42.115	I molecules.
7.42.116	Similarly, the dramatically altered gene expression of tumor cells leads to expression of extremely deformed or absent MHC
7.42.117	I molecules that also signal “
7.42.118	unhealthy” or “abnormal.
7.42.119	” NK cells are always active; an interaction with normal, intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing sequence, and the NK cell moves on.
7.42.120	After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell, its cytoplasm secretes granules comprised of perforin, a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell.
7.42.121	Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse.
7.42.122	A granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis.
7.42.123	Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind.
7.42.124	NK cells are constantly patrolling the body and are an effective mechanism for controlling potential infections and preventing cancer progression.
7.42.125	Complement
7.42.126	An array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins, called a complement system, functions to destroy extracellular pathogens.
7.42.127	Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms.
7.42.128	The complement system is so named because it is complementary to the antibody response of the adaptive immune system.
7.42.129	Complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies.
7.42.130	Binding of complement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence, with each successive protein being activated by cleavage and/or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein(s).
7.42.131	After the first few complement proteins bind, a cascade of sequential binding events follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement proteins.
7.42.132	Complement proteins perform several functions.
7.42.133	The proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and B cells, and enhance engulfment; this process is called opsonization.
7.42.134	Certain complement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes.
7.42.135	These structures destroy pathogens by causing their contents to leak, as illustrated in Figure 42.7.
7.42.136	The classic pathway for the complement cascade involves the attachment of several initial complement proteins to an antibody-bound pathogen followed by rapid activation and binding of many more complement proteins and the creation of destructive pores in the microbial cell envelope and cell wall.
7.42.137	The alternate pathway does not involve antibody activation.
7.42.138	Rather, C3 convertase spontaneously breaks down C3.
7.42.139	Endogenous regulatory proteins prevent the complement complex from binding to host cells.
7.42.140	Pathogens lacking these regulatory proteins are lysed.
7.42.141	Adaptive Immune Response
7.42.142	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain adaptive immunity Compare and contrast adaptive and innate immunity Describe cell-mediated immune response and humoral immune response Describe immune tolerance
7.42.143	The adaptive, or acquired, immune response takes days or even weeks to become established—much longer than the innate response; however, adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory.
7.42.144	Adaptive immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination.
7.42.145	This part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection.
7.42.146	In fact, without information from the innate immune system, the adaptive response could not be mobilized.
7.42.147	There are two types of adaptive responses: the cellmediated immune response, which is carried out by T cells, and the humoral immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies.
7.42.148	Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen.
7.42.149	Their attack can kill pathogens directly or secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens and disrupt the infection.
7.42.150	Adaptive immunity also involves a memory to provide the host with long-term protection from reinfection with the same type of pathogen; on re-exposure, this memory will facilitate an efficient and quick response.
7.42.151	Antigen-presenting Cells Unlike NK cells of the innate immune system, B cells (B lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that gives rise to antibodies, whereas T cells (T lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the immune response.
7.42.152	T cells are a key component in the cell-mediated response—the specific immune response that utilizes T cells to neutralize cells that have been infected with viruses and certain bacteria.
7.42.153	There are three types of T cells: cytotoxic, helper, and suppressor T cells.
7.42.154	Cytotoxic T cells destroy virus-infected cells in the cell-mediated immune response, and helper T cells play a part in activating both the antibody and the cell-mediated immune responses.
7.42.155	Suppressor T cells deactivate T cells and B cells when needed, and thus prevent the immune response from becoming too intense.
7.42.156	An antigen is a foreign or “non-self” macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system.
7.42.157	Not all antigens will provoke a response.
7.42.158	For instance, individuals produce innumerable “self” antigens and are constantly exposed to harmless foreign antigens, such as food proteins, pollen, or dust components.
7.42.159	The suppression of immune responses to harmless macromolecules is highly regulated and typically prevents processes that could be damaging to the host, known as tolerance.
7.42.160	The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens, and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens.
7.42.161	An antigen-presenting cell (APC) is an immune cell that detects, engulfs, and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection.
7.42.162	When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen.
7.42.163	Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells.
7.42.164	Dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material; they are present in the skin (Langerhans cells) and the lining of the nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines.
7.42.165	Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response, thus functioning as an antigen-presenting cell.
7.42.166	Macrophages also function as APCs.
7.42.167	Before activation and differentiation, B cells can also function as APCs.
7.42.168	After phagocytosis by APCs, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome forming phagolysosome.
7.42.169	Within the phagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class I or MHC class II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation, as illustrated in Figure 42.8.
7.42.170	Note that T lymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC II molecule.
7.42.171	APCs express MHC on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal a “non-self” invader.
7.42.172	Once the fragment of antigen is embedded in the MHC II molecule, the immune cell can respond.
7.42.173	Helper T- cells are one of the main lymphocytes that respond to antigen-presenting cells.
7.42.174	Recall that all other nucleated cells of the body expressed MHC I molecules, which signal “healthy” or “normal.
7.42.175	”
7.42.176	An APC, such as a macrophage, engulfs and digests a foreign bacterium.
7.42.177	An antigen from the bacterium is presented on the cell surface in conjunction with an MHC II molecule Lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response interact with antigen-embedded MHC II molecules to mature into functional immune cells.
7.42.178	T and B Lymphocytes Lymphocytes in human circulating blood are approximately 80 to 90 percent T cells, shown in Figure 42.9, and 10 to 20 percent B cells.
7.42.179	Recall that the T cells are involved in the cell-mediated immune response, whereas B cells are part of the humoral immune response.
7.42.180	T cells encompass a heterogeneous population of cells with extremely diverse functions.
7.42.181	Some T cells respond to APCs of the innate immune system, and indirectly induce immune responses by releasing cytokines.
7.42.182	Other T cells stimulate B cells to prepare their own response.
7.42.183	Another population of T cells detects APC signals and directly kills the infected cells.
7.42.184	Other T cells are involved in suppressing inappropriate immune reactions to harmless or “self” antigens.
7.42.185	This scanning electron micrograph shows a T lymphocyte, which is responsible for the cell-mediated immune response.
7.42.186	T cells are able to recognize antigens.
7.42.187	T and B cells exhibit a common theme of recognition/binding of specific antigens via a complementary receptor, followed by activation and self-amplification/maturation to specifically bind to the particular antigen of the infecting pathogen.
7.42.188	T and B lymphocytes are also similar in that each cell only expresses one type of antigen receptor.
7.42.189	Any individual may possess a population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen.
7.42.190	T and B cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens, called epitopes, presented by APCs, illustrated in Figure 42.10.
7.42.191	Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire antigen; for this reason, epitopes are known as “antigenic determinants.
7.42.192	”
7.42.193	In the absence of information from APCs, T and B cells remain inactive, or naïve, and are unable to prepare an immune response.
7.42.194	The requirement for information from the APCs of innate immunity to trigger B cell or T cell activation illustrates the essential nature of the innate immune response to the functioning of the entire immune system.
7.42.195	An antigen is a macromolecule that reacts with components of the immune system.
7.42.196	A given antigen may contain several motifs that are recognized by immune cells.
7.42.197	Each motif is an epitope.
7.42.198	In this figure, the entire structure is an antigen, and the orange, salmon and green components projecting from it represent potential epitopes.
7.42.199	Naïve T cells can express one of two different molecules, CD4 or CD8, on their surface, as shown in Figure 42.11, and are accordingly classified as CD4+ or CD8+ cells.
7.42.200	These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with and respond to an APC.
7.42.201	Naïve CD4+ cells bind APCs via their antigen-embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T (TH) lymphocytes, cells that go on to stimulate B cells (or cytotoxic T cells) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat.
7.42.202	In contrast, CD8+ cells engage antigen-embedded MHC
7.42.203	I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response.
7.42.204	The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune protection, but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors (TCRs).
7.42.205	The CD4 or CD8 surface molecules differentiate whether the TCR will engage an MHC II or an MHC I molecule.
7.42.206	Because they assist in binding specificity, the CD4 and CD8 molecules are described as coreceptors.
7.42.207	Consider the innumerable possible antigens that an individual will be exposed to during a lifetime.
7.42.208	The mammalian adaptive immune system is adept in responding appropriately to each antigen.
7.42.209	Mammals have an enormous diversity of T cell populations, resulting from the diversity of TCRs.
7.42.210	Each TCR consists of two polypeptide chains that span the T cell membrane, as illustrated in Figure 42.12; the chains are linked by a disulfide bridge.
7.42.211	Each polypeptide chain is comprised of a constant domain and a variable domain: a domain, in this sense, is a specific region of a protein that may be regulatory or structural.
7.42.212	The intracellular domain is involved in intracellular signaling.
7.42.213	A single T cell will express thousands of identical copies of one specific TCR variant on its cell surface.
7.42.214	The specificity of the adaptive immune system occurs because it synthesizes millions of different T cell populations, each expressing a TCR that differs in its variable domain.
7.42.215	This TCR diversity is achieved by the mutation and recombination of genes that encode these receptors in stem cell precursors of T cells.
7.42.216	The binding between an antigen-displaying MHC molecule and a complementary TCR “match” indicates that the adaptive immune system needs to activate and produce that specific T cell because its structure is appropriate to recognize and destroy the invading pathogen.
7.42.217	A T cell receptor spans the membrane and projects variable binding regions into the extracellular space to bind processed antigens via MHC molecules on APCs.
7.42.218	Helper T Lymphocytes
7.42.219	The TH lymphocytes function indirectly to identify potential pathogens for other cells of the immune system.
7.42.220	These cells are important for extracellular infections, such as those caused by certain bacteria, helminths, and protozoa.
7.42.221	TH lymphocytes recognize specific antigens displayed in the MHC II complexes of APCs.
7.42.222	There are two major populations of TH cells: TH1 and TH2.
7.42.223	TH1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells.
7.42.224	TH1 cells activate the action of cyotoxic T cells, as well as macrophages.
7.42.225	TH2 cells stimulate naïve B cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody secretion.
7.42.226	Whether a TH1 or a TH2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate immune system, which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen.
7.42.227	The TH1-mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation.
7.42.228	Recall the frontline defenses of macrophages involved in the innate immune response.
7.42.229	Some intracellular bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have evolved to multiply in macrophages after they have been engulfed.
7.42.230	These pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to destroy and digest the pathogen.
7.42.231	When M. tuberculosis infection occurs, macrophages can stimulate naïve T cells to become TH1 cells.
7.42.232	These stimulated T cells secrete specific cytokines that send feedback to the macrophage to stimulate its digestive capabilities and allow it to destroy the colonizing M. tuberculosis.
7.42.233	In the same manner, TH1-activated macrophages also become better suited to ingest and kill tumor cells.
7.42.234	In summary; TH1 responses are directed toward intracellular invaders while TH2 responses are aimed at those that are extracellular.
7.42.235	B Lymphocytes When stimulated by the TH2 pathway, naïve B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells.
7.42.236	A plasma cell is an immune cell that secrets antibodies; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens.
7.42.237	Similar to T cells, naïve B cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors (BCRs), which are membrane-bound forms of Ig (immunoglobulin, or an antibody).
7.42.238	The B cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light chains connected by disulfide linkages.
7.42.239	Each chain has a constant and a variable region; the latter is involved in antigen binding.
7.42.240	Two other membrane proteins, Ig alpha and Ig beta, are involved in signaling.
7.42.241	The receptors of any particular B cell, as shown in Figure 42.13 are all the same, but the hundreds of millions of different B cells in an individual have distinct recognition domains that contribute to extensive diversity in the types of molecular structures to which they can bind.
7.42.242	In this state, B cells function as APCs.
7.42.243	They bind and engulf foreign antigens via their BCRs and then display processed antigens in the context of MHC II molecules to TH2 cells.
7.42.244	When a TH2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen, it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly, which makes thousands of identical (clonal) copies of it, and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs.
7.42.245	The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection.
7.42.246	This phenomenon drastically, but briefly, changes the proportions of BCR variants expressed by the immune system, and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen.
7.42.247	B cell receptors are embedded in the membranes of B cells and bind a variety of antigens through their variable regions.
7.42.248	The signal transduction region transfers the signal into the cell.
7.42.249	T and B cells differ in one fundamental way: whereas T cells bind antigens that have been digested and embedded in MHC molecules by APCs, B cells function as APCs that bind intact antigens that have not been processed.
7.42.250	Although T and B cells both react with molecules that are termed “antigens,” these lymphocytes actually respond to very different types of molecules.
7.42.251	B cells must be able to bind intact antigens because they secrete antibodies that must recognize the pathogen directly, rather than digested remnants of the pathogen.
7.42.252	Bacterial carbohydrate and lipid molecules can activate B cells independently from the T cells.
7.42.253	Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes CTLs, a subclass of T cells, function to clear infections directly.
7.42.254	The cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system consists of CTLs that attack and destroy infected cells.
7.42.255	CTLs are particularly important in protecting against viral infections; this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating antibodies.
7.42.256	When APCs phagocytize pathogens and present MHC I-embedded antigens to naïve CD8+ T cells that express complementary TCRs, the CD8+ T cells become activated to proliferate according to clonal selection.
7.42.257	These resulting CTLs then identify non-APCs displaying the same MHC I-embedded antigens (for example, viral proteins)—for example, the CTLs identify infected host cells.
7.42.258	Intracellularly, infected cells typically die after the infecting pathogen replicates to a sufficient concentration and lyses the cell, as many viruses do.
7.42.259	CTLs attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen can replicate and escape, thereby halting the progression of intracellular infections.
7.42.260	CTLs also support NK lymphocytes to destroy early cancers.
7.42.261	Cytokines secreted by the TH1 response that stimulates macrophages also stimulate CTLs and enhance their ability to identify and destroy infected cells and tumors.
7.42.262	CTLs sense MHC I-embedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their TCRs.
7.42.263	Binding of TCRs with antigens activates CTLs to release perforin and granzyme, degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis of the infected cell.
7.42.264	Recall that this is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by NK cells.
7.42.265	In this process, the CTL does not become infected and is not harmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes.
7.42.266	In fact, the functions of NK cells and CTLs are complementary and maximize the removal of infected cells, as illustrated in Figure 42.14.
7.42.267	If the NK cell cannot identify the “missing self” pattern of down-regulated MHC I molecules, then the CTL can identify it by the complex of MHC I with foreign antigens, which signals “altered self.
7.42.268	”
7.42.269	Similarly, if the CTL cannot detect antigen-embedded MHC I because the receptors are depleted from the cell surface, NK cells will destroy the cell instead.
7.42.270	CTLs also emit cytokines, such as interferons, that alter surface protein expression in other infected cells, such that the infected cells can be easily identified and destroyed.
7.42.271	Moreover, these interferons can also prevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles.
7.42.272	Plasma cells and CTLs are collectively called effector cells: they represent differentiated versions of their naïve counterparts, and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells.
7.42.273	Mucosal Surfaces and Immune Tolerance
7.42.274	The innate and adaptive immune responses discussed thus far comprise the systemic immune system (affecting the whole body), which is distinct from the mucosal immune system.
7.42.275	Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, which functions independently of the systemic immune system, and which has its own innate and adaptive components.
7.42.276	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), illustrated in Figure 42.15, is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body.
7.42.277	This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment.
7.42.278	The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell types.
7.42.279	Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells called M cells and delivered to APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue.
7.42.280	M cells function in the transport described, and are located in the Peyer’s patch, a lymphoid nodule.
7.42.281	APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells, with B cells and macrophages having minor roles.
7.42.282	Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the MALT and at various mucosal induction sites, such as the tonsils, adenoids, appendix, or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the intestine.
7.42.283	Activated T cells then migrate through the lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of infection.
7.42.284	The topology and function of intestinal MALT is shown.
7.42.285	Pathogens are taken up by M cells in the intestinal epithelium and excreted into a pocket formed by the inner surface of the cell.
7.42.286	The pocket contains antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, which engulf the antigens, then present them with MHC II molecules on the cell surface.
7.42.287	The dendritic cells migrate to an underlying tissue called a Peyer’s patch.
7.42.288	Antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and B cells aggregate within the Peyer’s patch, forming organized lymphoid follicles.
7.42.289	There, some T cells and B cells are activated.
7.42.290	Other antigen-loaded dendritic cells migrate through the lymphatic system where they activate B cells, T cells, and plasma cells in the lymph nodes.
7.42.291	The activated cells then return to MALT tissue effector sites.
7.42.292	IgA and other antibodies are secreted into the intestinal lumen.
7.42.293	MALT is a crucial component of a functional immune system because mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal passages, are the first tissues onto which inhaled or ingested pathogens are deposited.
7.42.294	The mucosal tissue includes the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus, and the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts.
7.42.295	The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful, unnecessary responses to harmless substances, and more importantly so that it does not attack “self.
7.42.296	”
7.42.297	The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance.
7.42.298	Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances (such as food proteins) that APCs of the oral cavity, pharynx, and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter.
7.42.299	Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver, lymph nodes, small intestine, and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory T (Treg) cells, specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors.
7.42.300	The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead.
7.42.301	In addition to promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens, other subsets of Treg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response, which is an inappropriate immune response to host cells or self-antigens.
7.42.302	Another Treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis.
7.42.303	Immunological Memory
7.42.304	The adaptive immune system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic response upon reinvasion of the same pathogen.
7.42.305	Memory is handled by the adaptive immune system with little reliance on cues from the innate response.
7.42.306	During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been encountered before, called a primary response, plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells increase, then plateau over time.
7.42.307	As B and T cells mature into effector cells, a subset of the naïve populations differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen specificities, as illustrated in Figure 42.16.
7.42.308	A memory cell is an antigen-specific B or T
7.42.309	lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary immune response, but that can immediately become effector cells upon re-exposure to the same pathogen.
7.42.310	During the primary immune response, memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses.
7.42.311	As the infection is cleared and pathogenic stimuli subside, the effectors are no longer needed, and they undergo apoptosis.
7.42.312	In contrast, the memory cells persist in the circulation.
7.42.313	If the pathogen is never encountered again during the individual’s lifetime, B and T memory cells will circulate for a few years or even several decades and will gradually die off, having never functioned as effector cells.
7.42.314	However, if the host is re-exposed to the same pathogen type, circulating memory cells will immediately differentiate into plasma cells and CTLs without input from APCs or TH cells.
7.42.315	One reason the adaptive immune response is delayed is because it takes time for naïve B and T cells with the appropriate antigen specificities to be identified and activated.
7.42.316	Upon reinfection, this step is skipped, and the result is a more rapid production of immune defenses.
7.42.317	Memory B cells that differentiate into plasma cells output tens to hundreds-fold greater antibody amounts than were secreted during the primary response, as the graph in Figure 42.17 illustrates.
7.42.318	This rapid and dramatic antibody response may stop the infection before it can even become established, and the individual may not realize they had been exposed.
7.42.319	In the primary response to infection, antibodies are secreted first from plasma cells.
7.42.320	Upon re-exposure to the same pathogen, memory cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells that output a greater amount of antibody for a longer period of time.
7.42.321	Vaccination is based on the knowledge that exposure to noninfectious antigens, derived from known pathogens, generates a mild primary immune response.
7.42.322	The immune response to vaccination may not be perceived by the host as illness but still confers immune memory.
7.42.323	When exposed to the corresponding pathogen to which an individual was vaccinated, the reaction is similar to a secondary exposure.
7.42.324	Because each reinfection generates more memory cells and increased resistance to the pathogen, and because some memory cells die, certain vaccine courses involve one or more booster vaccinations to mimic repeat exposures: for instance, tetanus boosters are necessary every ten years because the memory cells only live that long.
7.42.325	Mucosal Immune Memory
7.42.326	A subset of T and B cells of the mucosal immune system differentiates into memory cells just as in the systemic immune system.
7.42.327	Upon reinvasion of the same pathogen type, a pronounced immune response occurs at the mucosal site where the original pathogen deposited, but a collective defense is also organized within interconnected or adjacent mucosal tissue.
7.42.328	For instance, the immune memory of an infection in the oral cavity would also elicit a response in the pharynx if the oral cavity was exposed to the same pathogen.
7.42.329	Primary Centers of the Immune System
7.42.330	Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites.
7.42.331	The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors through the body.
7.42.332	Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which encompass monocytes (the precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes.
7.42.333	The majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes (red blood cells).
7.42.334	Lymph is a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes.
7.42.335	Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue).
7.42.336	The cells of the immune system originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.
7.42.337	Cytokines stimulate these stem cells to differentiate into immune cells.
7.42.338	B cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, whereas naïve T cells transit from the bone marrow to the thymus for maturation.
7.42.339	In the thymus, immature T cells that express TCRs complementary to self-antigens are destroyed.
7.42.340	This process helps prevent autoimmune responses.
7.42.341	On maturation, T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations.
7.42.342	Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body, as illustrated in Figure 42.20, house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages.
7.42.343	Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues.
7.42.344	These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation.
7.42.345	APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens.
7.42.346	(a) Lymphatic vessels carry a clear fluid called lymph throughout the body.
7.42.347	The liquid enters (b) lymph nodes through afferent vessels.
7.42.348	Lymph nodes are filled with lymphocytes that purge infecting cells.
7.42.349	The lymph then exits through efferent vessels.
7.42.350	The spleen houses B and T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells.
7.42.351	The spleen, shown in Figure 42.21, is the site where APCs that have trapped foreign particles in the blood can communicate with lymphocytes.
7.42.352	Antibodies are synthesized and secreted by activated plasma cells in the spleen, and the spleen filters foreign substances and antibody-complexed pathogens from the blood.
7.42.353	Functionally, the spleen is to the blood as lymph nodes are to the lymph.
7.42.354	The spleen is similar to a lymph node but is much larger and filters blood instead of lymph.
7.42.355	Blood enters the spleen through arteries and exits through veins.
7.42.356	The spleen contains two types of tissue: red pulp and white pulp.
7.42.357	Red pulp consists of cavities that store blood.
7.42.358	Within the red pulp, damaged red blood cells are removed and replaced by new ones.
7.42.359	White pulp is rich in lymphocytes that remove antigen-coated bacteria from the blood.
7.42.360	Antibodies
7.42.361	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain cross-reactivity Describe the structure and function of
7.42.362	antibodies Discuss antibody production
7.42.363	An antibody, also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen.
7.42.364	Antibodies are the functional basis of humoral immunity.
7.42.365	Antibodies occur in the blood, in gastric and mucus secretions, and in breast milk.
7.42.366	Antibodies in these bodily fluids can bind pathogens and mark them for destruction by phagocytes before they can infect cells.
7.42.367	Antibody Structure
7.42.368	An antibody molecule is comprised of four polypeptides: two identical heavy chains (large peptide units) that are partially bound to each other in a “Y” formation, which are flanked by two identical light chains (small peptide units), as illustrated in Figure 42.22.
7.42.369	Bonds between the cysteine amino acids in the antibody molecule attach the polypeptides to each other.
7.42.370	The areas where the antigen is recognized on the antibody are variable domains and the antibody base is composed of constant domains.
7.42.371	In germ-line B cells, the variable region of the light chain gene has 40 variable (V) and five joining (J) segments.
7.42.372	An enzyme called DNA recombinase randomly excises most of these segments out of the gene, and splices one V segment to one J segment.
7.42.373	During RNA processing, all but one V and J segment are spliced out.
7.42.374	Recombination and splicing may result in over 106 possible VJ combinations.
7.42.375	As a result, each differentiated B cell in the human body typically has a unique variable chain.
7.42.376	The constant domain, which does not bind antibody, is the same for all antibodies.
7.42.377	(a) As a germ-line B cell matures, an enzyme called DNA recombinase randomly excises V and J segments from the light chain gene.
7.42.378	Splicing at the mRNA level results in further gene rearrangement.
7.42.379	As a result, (b) each antibody has a unique variable region capable of binding a different antigen.
7.42.380	Similar to TCRs and BCRs, antibody diversity is produced by the mutation and recombination of approximately 300 different gene segments encoding the light and heavy chain variable domains in precursor cells that are destined to become B cells.
7.42.381	The variable domains from the heavy and light chains interact to form the binding site through which an antibody can bind a specific epitope on an antigen.
7.42.382	The numbers of repeated constant domains in Ig classes are the same for all antibodies corresponding to a specific class.
7.42.383	Antibodies are structurally similar to the extracellular component of the BCRs, and B cell maturation to plasma cells can be visualized in simple terms as the cell acquires the ability to secrete the extracellular portion of its BCR in large quantities.
7.42.384	Antibody Classes Antibodies can be divided into five classes—IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE—based on their physiochemical, structural, and immunological properties.
7.42.385	IgGs, which make up about 80 percent of all antibodies, have heavy chains that consist of one variable domain and three identical constant domains.
7.42.386	IgA and IgD also have three constant domains per heavy chain, whereas IgM and IgE each have four constant domains per heavy chain.
7.42.387	The variable domain determines binding specificity and the constant domain of the heavy chain determines the immunological mechanism of action of the corresponding antibody class.
7.42.388	It is possible for two antibodies to have the same binding specificities but be in different classes and, therefore, to be involved in different functions.
7.42.389	After an adaptive defense is produced against a pathogen, typically plasma cells first secrete IgM into the blood.
7.42.390	BCRs on naïve B cells are of the IgM class and occasionally IgD class.
7.42.391	IgM molecules make up approximately ten percent of all antibodies.
7.42.392	Prior to antibody secretion, plasma cells assemble IgM molecules into pentamers (five individual antibodies) linked by a joining (J) chain, as shown in Figure 42.23.
7.42.393	The pentamer arrangement means that these macromolecules can bind ten identical antigens.
7.42.394	However, IgM molecules released early in the adaptive immune response do not bind to antigens as stably as IgGs, which are one of the possible types of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon re-exposure to the same pathogen.
7.42.395	Figure 42.23 summarizes the properties of immunoglobulins and illustrates their basic structures.
7.42.396	Immunoglobulins have different functions, but all are composed of light and heavy chains that form a Y-shaped structure.
7.42.397	IgAs populate the saliva, tears, breast milk, and mucus secretions of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts.
7.42.398	Collectively, these bodily fluids coat and protect the extensive mucosa (4000 square feet in humans).
7.42.399	The total number of IgA molecules in these bodily secretions is greater than the number of IgG molecules in the blood serum.
7.42.400	A small amount of IgA is also secreted into the serum in monomeric form.
7.42.401	Conversely, some IgM is secreted into bodily fluids of the mucosa.
7.42.402	Similar to IgM, IgA molecules are secreted as polymeric structures linked with a J chain.
7.42.403	However, IgAs are secreted mostly as dimeric molecules, not pentamers.
7.42.404	IgE is present in the serum in small quantities and is best characterized in its role as an allergy mediator.
7.42.405	IgD is also present in small quantities.
7.42.406	Similar to IgM, BCRs of the IgD class are found on the surface of naïve B cells.
7.42.407	This class supports antigen recognition and maturation of B cells to plasma cells.
7.42.408	Antibody Functions Differentiated plasma cells are crucial players in the humoral response, and the antibodies they secrete are particularly significant against extracellular pathogens and toxins.
7.42.409	Antibodies circulate freely and act independently of plasma cells.
7.42.410	Antibodies can be transferred from one individual to another to temporarily protect against infectious disease.
7.42.411	For instance, a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor’s blood serum.
7.42.412	This phenomenon is called passive immunity; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding, which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to infections during the first few months of life.
7.42.413	Antibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them, as illustrated in Figure 42.24, by blocking key sites on the pathogen that enhance their infectivity (such as receptors that “dock” pathogens on host cells).
7.42.414	Antibody neutralization can prevent pathogens from entering and infecting host cells, as opposed to the CTL-mediated approach of killing cells that are already infected to prevent progression of an established infection.
7.42.415	The neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be filtered by the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces.
7.42.416	Antibodies may inhibit infection by (a) preventing the antigen from binding its target, (b) tagging a pathogen for destruction by macrophages or neutrophils, or (c) activating the complement cascade.
7.42.417	Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils, because phagocytic cells are highly attracted to macromolecules complexed with antibodies.
7.42.418	Phagocytic enhancement by antibodies is called opsonization.
7.42.419	In a process called complement fixation, IgM and IgG in serum bind to antigens and provide docking sites onto which sequential complement proteins can bind.
7.42.420	The combination of antibodies and complement enhances opsonization even further and promotes rapid clearing of pathogens.
7.42.421	Affinity, Avidity, and Cross Reactivity
7.42.422	Not all antibodies bind with the same strength, specificity, and stability.
7.42.423	In fact, antibodies exhibit different affinities (attraction) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules, as illustrated in Figure 42.25.
7.42.424	An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably, and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen.
7.42.425	(a)
7.42.426	Affinity refers to the strength of single interaction between antigen and antibody, while avidity refers to the strength of all interactions combined.
7.42.427	(b)
7.42.428	An antibody may cross react with different epitopes.
7.42.429	The term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined, multivalent structures (such as IgM and IgA).
7.42.430	Although avidity measures the strength of binding, just as affinity does, the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure.
7.42.431	The avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the antigen being detected, as well as other physical and chemical factors.
7.42.432	Typically, multimeric antibodies, such as pentameric IgM, are classified as having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies, but high avidity.
7.42.433	Essentially, the fact that multimeric antibodies can bind many antigens simultaneously balances their slightly lower binding strength for each antibody/antigen interaction.
7.42.434	Antibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar epitopes on different antigens.
7.42.435	Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region (the surface area of about four to six amino acids), it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions.
7.42.436	Cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion, but to a different antigen.
7.42.437	Cross reactivity can be beneficial if an individual develops immunity to several related pathogens despite having only been exposed to or vaccinated against one of them.
7.42.438	For instance, antibody cross reactivity may occur against the similar surface structures of various Gram-negative bacteria.
7.42.439	Conversely, antibodies raised against pathogenic molecular components that resemble self molecules may incorrectly mark host cells for destruction and cause autoimmune damage.
7.42.440	Patients who develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly exhibit antibodies that react with their own DNA.
7.42.441	These antibodies may have been initially raised against the nucleic acid of microorganisms but later cross-reacted with self-antigens.
7.42.442	This phenomenon is also called molecular mimicry.
7.42.443	Antibodies of the Mucosal Immune System Antibodies synthesized by the mucosal immune system include IgA and IgM. Activated B cells differentiate into mucosal plasma cells that synthesize and secrete dimeric IgA, and to a lesser extent, pentameric IgM. Secreted IgA is abundant in tears, saliva, breast milk, and in secretions of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.
7.42.444	Antibody secretion results in a local humoral response at epithelial surfaces and prevents infection of the mucosa by binding and neutralizing pathogens.
7.42.445	Disruptions in the Immune System
7.42.446	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe hypersensitivity Define autoimmunity A functioning immune system is essential for survival, but even the sophisticated cellular and molecular defenses of the mammalian immune response can be defeated by pathogens at virtually every step.
7.42.447	In the competition between immune protection and pathogen evasion, pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution because of their shorter generation time and other characteristics.
7.42.448	For instance, Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterium that cause pneumonia and meningitis) surrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune system.
7.42.449	Staphylococcus aureus (bacterium that can cause skin infections, abscesses, and meningitis) synthesizes a toxin called leukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium.
7.42.450	Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system.
7.42.451	HIV infects TH cells via their CD4 surface molecules, gradually depleting the number of TH cells in the body; this inhibits the adaptive immune system’s capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors.
7.42.452	As a result, HIV-infected individuals often suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but which can cause devastating illness to immune-compromised individuals.
7.42.453	Maladaptive responses of immune cells and molecules themselves can also disrupt the proper functioning of the entire system, leading to host cell damage that could become fatal.
7.42.454	Immunodeficiency Failures, insufficiencies, or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed.
7.42.455	Immunodeficiency is the failure, insufficiency, or delay in the response of the immune system, which may be acquired or inherited.
7.42.456	Immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens (such as HIV), chemical exposure (including certain medical treatments), malnutrition, or possibly by extreme stress.
7.42.457	For instance, radiation exposure can destroy populations of lymphocytes and elevate an individual’s susceptibility to infections and cancer.
7.42.458	Dozens of genetic disorders result in immunodeficiencies, including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Bare lymphocyte syndrome, and MHC II deficiencies.
7.42.459	Rarely, primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may occur.
7.42.460	Neutropenia is one form in which the immune system produces a below-average number of neutrophils, the body’s most abundant phagocytes.
7.42.461	As a result, bacterial infections may go unrestricted in the blood, causing serious complications.
7.42.462	Hypersensitivities Maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are termed hypersensitivities.
7.42.463	The types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmunity.
7.42.464	A large proportion of the population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity.
7.42.465	Allergies
7.42.466	The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy.
7.42.467	In the United States, 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens.
7.42.468	Upon initial exposure to a potential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting processed antigen to TH cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE.
7.42.469	This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response to parasitic worms.
7.42.470	The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues.
7.42.471	This process primes, or sensitizes, the tissue.
7.42.472	Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, IgE molecules on mast cells bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses.
7.42.473	Figure 42.26 shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen.
7.42.474	The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy, watery eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy welts or hives, airway contraction with severe respiratory distress, and plummeting blood pressure.
7.42.475	This extreme reaction is known as anaphylactic shock.
7.42.476	If not treated with epinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects, this condition can be fatal.
7.42.477	On first exposure to an allergen, an IgE antibody is synthesized by plasma cells in response to a harmless antigen.
7.42.478	The IgE molecules bind to mast cells, and on secondary exposure, the mast cells release histamines and other modulators that affect the symptoms of allergy.
7.42.479	Delayed hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response that takes approximately one to two days after secondary exposure for a maximal reaction to be observed.
7.42.480	This type of hypersensitivity involves the TH1 cytokine-mediated inflammatory response and may manifest as local tissue lesions or contact dermatitis (rash or skin irritation).
7.42.481	Delayed hypersensitivity occurs in some individuals in response to contact with certain types of jewelry or cosmetics.
7.42.482	Delayed hypersensitivity facilitates the immune response to poison ivy and is also the reason why the skin test for tuberculosis results in a small region of inflammation on individuals who were previously exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
7.42.483	That is also why cortisone is used to treat such responses: it will inhibit cytokine production.
7.42.484	Autoimmunity Autoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population.
7.42.485	Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response.
7.42.486	Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies.
7.42.487	In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies.
7.42.488	The result is muscle weakness that may include marked difficultly with fine and/or gross motor functions.
7.42.489	In systemic lupus erythematosus, a diffuse autoantibody response to the individual’s own DNA and proteins results in various systemic diseases.
7.42.490	As illustrated in Figure 42.27, systemic lupus erythematosus may affect the heart, joints, lungs, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, or other tissues, causing tissue damage via antibody binding, complement recruitment, lysis, and inflammation.
7.42.491	Systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by autoimmunity to the individual’s own DNA and/or proteins, which leads to varied dysfunction of the organs.
7.42.492	Autoimmunity can develop with time, and its causes may be rooted in molecular mimicry.
7.42.493	Antibodies and TCRs may bind self antigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens, which the immune receptors first raised.
7.42.494	As an example, infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (bacterium that causes strep throat) may generate antibodies or T cells that react with heart muscle, which has a similar structure to the surface of S. pyogenes.
7.42.495	These antibodies can damage heart muscle with autoimmune attacks, leading to rheumatic fever.
7.42.496	Insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus arises from a destructive inflammatory TH1 response against insulin-producing cells of the pancreas.
7.42.497	Patients with this autoimmunity must be injected with insulin that originates from other sources.
7.43.0	Female seahorses produce eggs for reproduction that are then fertilized by the male.
7.43.1	Unlike almost all other animals, the male seahorse then gestates the young until birth.
7.43.2	Animal reproduction is necessary for the survival of a species.
7.43.3	In the animal kingdom, there are innumerable ways that species reproduce.
7.43.4	Asexual reproduction produces genetically identical organisms (clones), whereas in sexual reproduction, the genetic material of two individuals combines to produce offspring that are genetically different from their parents.
7.43.5	During sexual reproduction the male gamete (sperm) may be placed inside the female’s body for internal fertilization, or the sperm and eggs may be released into the environment for external fertilization.
7.43.6	Seahorses, like the one shown in Figure 43.1, provide an example of the latter.
7.43.7	Following a mating dance, the female lays eggs in the male seahorse’s abdominal brood pouch where they are fertilized.
7.43.8	The eggs hatch and the offspring develop in the pouch for several weeks.
7.43.9	Reproduction Methods
7.43.10	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe advantages and disadvantages of asexual and sexual reproduction Discuss asexual reproduction methods
7.43.11	Discuss sexual reproduction methods
7.43.12	Animals produce offspring through asexual and/or sexual reproduction.
7.43.13	Both methods have advantages and disadvantages.
7.43.14	Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent.
7.43.15	A single individual can produce offspring asexually and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly.
7.43.16	In a stable or predictable environment, asexual reproduction is an effective means of reproduction because all the offspring will be adapted to that environment.
7.43.17	In an unstable or unpredictable environment asexually-reproducing species may be at a disadvantage because all the offspring are genetically identical and may not have the genetic variation to survive in new or different conditions.
7.43.18	On the other hand, the rapid rates of asexual reproduction may allow for a speedy response to environmental changes if individuals have mutations.
7.43.19	An additional advantage of asexual reproduction is that colonization of new habitats may be easier when an individual does not need to find a mate to reproduce.
7.43.20	During sexual reproduction the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring that differ from their parents.
7.43.21	The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment.
7.43.22	Species that reproduce sexually must maintain two different types of individuals, males and females, which can limit the ability to colonize new habitats as both sexes must be present.
7.43.23	Asexual Reproduction Asexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria) and in some eukaryotic single-celled and multicelled organisms.
7.43.24	There are a number of ways that animals reproduce asexually.
7.43.25	Fission Fission, also called binary fission, occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate, multi-celled organisms.
7.43.26	After a period of growth, an organism splits into two separate organisms.
7.43.27	Some unicellular eukaryotic organisms undergo binary fission by mitosis.
7.43.28	In other organisms, part of the individual separates and forms a second individual.
7.43.29	This process occurs, for example, in many asteroid echinoderms through splitting of the central disk.
7.43.30	Some sea anemones and some coral polyps (Figure 43.2) also reproduce through fission.
7.43.31	Budding Budding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region leading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals.
7.43.32	Budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such as corals and hydras.
7.43.33	In hydras, a bud forms that develops into an adult and breaks away from the main body, as illustrated in Figure 43.3, whereas in coral budding, the bud does not detach and multiplies as part of a new colony.
7.43.34	Hydra reproduce asexually through budding.
7.43.35	Fragmentation Fragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration.
7.43.36	If the animal is capable of fragmentation, and the part is big enough, a separate individual will regrow.
7.43.37	For example, in many sea stars, asexual reproduction is accomplished by fragmentation.
7.43.38	Figure 43.4 illustrates a sea star for which an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star.
7.43.39	Fisheries workers have been known to try to kill the sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing them back into the ocean.
7.43.40	Unfortunately for the workers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams.
7.43.41	Fragmentation also occurs in annelid worms, turbellarians, and poriferans.
7.43.42	Sea stars can reproduce through fragmentation.
7.43.43	The large arm, a fragment from another sea star, is developing into a new individual.
7.43.44	Note that in fragmentation, there is generally a noticeable difference in the size of the individuals, whereas in fission, two individuals of approximate size are formed.
7.43.45	Parthenogenesis Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized.
7.43.46	The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid, depending on the process and the species.
7.43.47	Parthenogenesis occurs in invertebrates such as water flees, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, some ants, wasps, and bees.
7.43.48	Bees use parthenogenesis to produce haploid males (drones) and diploid females (workers).
7.43.49	If an egg is fertilized, a queen is produced.
7.43.50	The queen bee controls the reproduction of the hive bees to regulate the type of bee produced.
7.43.51	Some vertebrate animals—such as certain reptiles, amphibians, and fish—also reproduce through parthenogenesis.
7.43.52	Although more common in plants, parthenogenesis has been observed in animal species that were segregated by sex in terrestrial or marine zoos.
7.43.53	Two female Komodo dragons, a hammerhead shark, and a blacktop shark have produced parthenogenic young when the females have been isolated from males.
7.43.54	Sexual Reproduction Sexual reproduction is the combination of (usually haploid) reproductive cells from two individuals to form a third (usually diploid) unique offspring.
7.43.55	Sexual reproduction produces offspring with novel combinations of genes.
7.43.56	This can be an adaptive advantage in unstable or unpredictable environments.
7.43.57	As humans, we are used to thinking of animals as having two separate sexes—male and female—determined at conception.
7.43.58	However, in the animal kingdom, there are many variations on this theme.
7.43.59	Hermaphroditism Hermaphroditism occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts.
7.43.60	Invertebrates such as earthworms, slugs, tapeworms and snails, shown in Figure 43.5, are often hermaphroditic.
7.43.61	Hermaphrodites may selffertilize or may mate with another of their species, fertilizing each other and both producing offspring.
7.43.62	Self fertilization is common in animals that have limited mobility or are not motile, such as barnacles and clams.
7.43.63	Many snails are hermaphrodites.
7.43.64	When two individuals mate, they can produce up to one hundred eggs each.
7.43.65	Sex Determination Mammalian sex determination is determined genetically by the presence of X and Y chromosomes.
7.43.66	Individuals homozygous for X (XX) are female and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male.
7.43.67	The presence of a Y chromosome causes the development of male characteristics and its absence results in female characteristics.
7.43.68	The XY system is also found in some insects and plants.
7.43.69	Avian sex determination is dependent on the presence of Z and W chromosomes.
7.43.70	Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male and heterozygous (ZW) results in a female.
7.43.71	The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar to the Y chromosome in mammals.
7.43.72	Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use this system.
7.43.73	The sex of some species is not determined by genetics but by some aspect of the environment.
7.43.74	Sex determination in some crocodiles and turtles, for example, is often dependent on the temperature during critical periods of egg development.
7.43.75	This is referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically as temperature-dependent sex determination.
7.43.76	In many turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females.
7.43.77	In some crocodiles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females.
7.43.78	In some species, sex is both genetic- and temperature-dependent.
7.43.79	Individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female.
7.43.80	If the individual is female first, it is termed protogyny or “first female,” if it is male first, its termed protandry or “first male.
7.43.81	”
7.43.82	Oysters, for example, are born male, grow, and become female and lay eggs; some oyster species change sex multiple times.
7.43.83	Fertilization
7.43.84	By the end of this section, you will be able to:
7.43.85	Discuss internal and external methods of fertilization Describe the methods used by animals for development of offspring during gestation Describe the anatomical adaptions that occurred in animals to facilitate reproduction Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization.
7.43.86	This can occur either inside ( internal fertilization) or outside ( external fertilization) the body of the female.
7.43.87	Humans provide an example of the former whereas seahorse reproduction is an example of the latter.
7.43.88	External Fertilization External fertilization usually occurs in aquatic environments where both eggs and sperm are released into the water.
7.43.89	After the sperm reaches the egg, fertilization takes place.
7.43.90	Most external fertilization happens during the process of spawning where one or several females release their eggs and the male(s) release sperm in the same area, at the same time.
7.43.91	The release of the reproductive material may be triggered by water temperature or the length of daylight.
7.43.92	Nearly all fish spawn, as do crustaceans (such as crabs and shrimp), mollusks (such as oysters), squid, and echinoderms (such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers).
7.43.93	Figure 43.6 shows salmon spawning in a shallow stream.
7.43.94	Frogs, like those shown in Figure 43.7, corals, molluscs, and sea cucumbers also spawn.
7.43.95	Salmon reproduce through spawning.
7.43.96	During sexual reproduction in toads, the male grasps the female from behind and externally fertilizes the eggs as they are deposited.
7.43.97	Pairs of fish that are not broadcast spawners may exhibit courtship behavior.
7.43.98	This allows the female to select a particular male.
7.43.99	The trigger for egg and sperm release (spawning) causes the egg and sperm to be placed in a small area, enhancing the possibility of fertilization.
7.43.100	External fertilization in an aquatic environment protects the eggs from drying out.
7.43.101	Broadcast spawning can result in a greater mixture of the genes within a group, leading to higher genetic diversity and a greater chance of species survival in a hostile environment.
7.43.102	For sessile aquatic organisms like sponges, broadcast spawning is the only mechanism for fertilization and colonization of new environments.
7.43.103	The presence of the fertilized eggs and developing young in the water provides opportunities for predation resulting in a loss of offspring.
7.43.104	Therefore, millions of eggs must be produced by individuals, and the offspring produced through this method must mature rapidly.
7.43.105	The survival rate of eggs produced through broadcast spawning is low.
7.43.106	Internal Fertilization Internal fertilization occurs most often in land-based animals, although some aquatic animals also use this method.
7.43.107	There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization.
7.43.108	In oviparity, fertilized eggs are laid outside the female’s body and develop there, receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg.
7.43.109	This occurs in most bony fish, many reptiles, some cartilaginous fish, most amphibians, two mammals, and all birds.
7.43.110	Reptiles and insects produce leathery eggs, while birds and turtles produce eggs with high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell, making them hard.
7.43.111	Chicken eggs are an example of this second type.
7.43.112	In ovoviparity, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg’s yolk and the young are fully developed when they are hatched.
7.43.113	This occurs in some bony fish (like the guppy Lebistes reticulatus), some sharks, some lizards, some snakes (such as the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis), some vipers, and some invertebrate animals (like the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa).
7.43.114	In viviparity the young develop within the female, receiving nourishment from the mother’s blood through a placenta.
7.43.115	The offspring develops in the female and is born alive.
7.43.116	This occurs in most mammals, some cartilaginous fish, and a few reptiles.
7.43.117	Internal fertilization has the advantage of protecting the fertilized egg from dehydration on land.
7.43.118	The embryo is isolated within the female, which limits predation on the young.
7.43.119	Internal fertilization enhances the fertilization of eggs by a specific male.
7.43.120	Fewer offspring are produced through this method, but their survival rate is higher than that for external fertilization.
7.43.121	The Evolution of Reproduction Once multicellular organisms evolved and developed specialized cells, some also developed tissues and organs with specialized functions.
7.43.122	An early development in reproduction occurred in the Annelids.
7.43.123	These organisms produce sperm and eggs from undifferentiated cells in their coelom and store them in that cavity.
7.43.124	When the coelom becomes filled, the cells are released through an excretory opening or by the body splitting open.
7.43.125	Reproductive organs evolved with the development of gonads that produce sperm and eggs.
7.43.126	These cells went through meiosis, an adaption of mitosis, which reduced the number of chromosomes in each reproductive cell by half, while increasing the number of cells through cell division.
7.43.127	Complete reproductive systems were developed in insects, with separate sexes.
7.43.128	Sperm are made in testes and then travel through coiled tubes to the epididymis for storage.
7.43.129	Eggs mature in the ovary.
7.43.130	When they are released from the ovary, they travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization.
7.43.131	Some insects have a specialized sac, called a spermatheca, which stores sperm for later use, sometimes up to a year.
7.43.132	Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival.
7.43.133	Vertebrates have similar structures, with a few differences.
7.43.134	Non-mammals, such as birds and reptiles, have a common body opening, called a cloaca, for the digestive, excretory and reproductive systems.
7.43.135	Coupling between birds usually involves positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm.
7.43.136	Mammals have separate openings for the systems in the female and a uterus for support of developing offspring.
7.43.137	The uterus has two chambers in species that produce large numbers of offspring at a time, while species that produce one offspring, such as primates, have a single uterus.
7.43.138	Sperm transfer from the male to the female during reproduction ranges from releasing the sperm into the watery environment for external fertilization, to the joining of cloaca in birds, to the development of a penis for direct delivery into the female’s vagina in mammals.
7.43.139	Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis
7.43.140	By the end of this section, you will be able to:
7.43.141	Describe human male and female reproductive anatomies Discuss the human sexual response Describe spermatogenesis and oogenesis and discuss their differences and similarities
7.43.142	As animals became more complex, specific organs and organ systems developed to support specific functions for the organism.
7.43.143	The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the growth and development of offspring.
7.43.144	Human Reproductive Anatomy
7.43.145	The reproductive tissues of male and female humans develop similarly in utero until a low level of the hormone testosterone is released from male gonads.
7.43.146	Testosterone causes the undeveloped tissues to differentiate into male sexual organs.
7.43.147	When testosterone is absent, the tissues develop into female sexual tissues.
7.43.148	Primitive gonads become testes or ovaries.
7.43.149	Tissues that produce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females.
7.43.150	The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a female; that is, they are homologous structures.
7.43.151	Male Reproductive Anatomy
7.43.152	In the male reproductive system, the scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function.
7.43.153	The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones.
7.43.154	Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in) in size and divided into wedge-shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa.
7.43.155	Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm.
7.43.156	Sperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated in Figure 43.8 so that a proper temperature is maintained for motility.
7.43.157	In land mammals, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the body at about 2° C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm.
7.43.158	Infertility can occur in land mammals when the testes do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development.
7.43.159	Sperm mature in seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes, as illustrated in Figure 43.8.
7.43.160	The walls of the seminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells, with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule and the fully developed sperm in the lumen.
7.43.161	The sperm cells are mixed with “nursemaid” cells called Sertoli cells which protect the germ cells and promote their development.
7.43.162	Other cells mixed in the wall of the tubules are the interstitial cells of Leydig.
7.43.163	These cells produce high levels of testosterone once the male reaches adolescence.
7.43.164	When the sperm have developed flagella and are nearly mature, they leave the testicles and enter the epididymis, shown in Figure 43.8.
7.43.165	This structure resembles a comma and lies along the top and posterior portion of the testes; it is the site of sperm maturation.
7.43.166	The sperm leave the epididymis and enter the vas deferens (or ductus deferens), which carries the sperm, behind the bladder, and forms the ejaculatory duct with the duct from the seminal vesicles.
7.43.167	During a vasectomy, a section of the vas deferens is removed, preventing sperm from being passed out of the body during ejaculation and preventing fertilization.
7.43.168	Semen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions (about 10 percent of the total) and fluids from accessory glands that contribute most of the semen’s volume.
7.43.169	Sperm are haploid cells, consisting of a flagellum as a tail, a neck that contains the cell’s energy-producing mitochondria, and a head that contains the genetic material.
7.43.170	Figure 43.9 shows a micrograph of human sperm as well as a diagram of the parts of the sperm.
7.43.171	An acrosome is found at the top of the head of the sperm.
7.43.172	This structure contains lysosomal enzymes that can digest the protective coverings that surround the egg to help the sperm penetrate and fertilize the egg.
7.43.173	An ejaculate will contain from two to five milliliters of fluid with from 50–120 million sperm per milliliter.
7.43.174	Human sperm, visualized using scanning electron microscopy, have a flagellum, neck, and head.
7.43.175	The bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system.
7.43.176	These are the seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland, all of which are illustrated in Figure 43.8.
7.43.177	The seminal vesicles are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder.
7.43.178	The glands make a solution that is thick, yellowish, and alkaline.
7.43.179	As sperm are only motile in an alkaline environment, a basic pH is important to reverse the acidity of the vaginal environment.
7.43.180	The solution also contains mucus, fructose (a sperm mitochondrial nutrient), a coagulating enzyme, ascorbic acid, and local-acting hormones called prostaglandins.
7.43.181	The seminal vesicle glands account for 60 percent of the bulk of semen.
7.43.182	The penis, illustrated in Figure 43.8, is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory organ during intercourse.
7.43.183	The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ.
7.43.184	These consist of a pair of tubes on the dorsal side, called the corpus cavernosum, and a single tube of tissue on the ventral side, called the corpus spongiosum.
7.43.185	This tissue will become engorged with blood, becoming erect and hard, in preparation for intercourse.
7.43.186	The organ is inserted into the vagina culminating with an ejaculation.
7.43.187	During intercourse, the smooth muscle sphincters at the opening to the renal bladder close and prevent urine from entering the penis.
7.43.188	An orgasm is a two-stage process: first, glands and accessory organs connected to the testes contract, then semen (containing sperm) is expelled through the urethra during ejaculation.
7.43.189	After intercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid.
7.43.190	The walnut-shaped prostate gland surrounds the urethra, the connection to the urinary bladder.
7.43.191	It has a series of short ducts that directly connect to the urethra.
7.43.192	The gland is a mixture of smooth muscle and glandular tissue.
7.43.193	The muscle provides much of the force needed for ejaculation to occur.
7.43.194	The glandular tissue makes a thin, milky fluid that contains citrate (a nutrient), enzymes, and prostate specific antigen (PSA).
7.43.195	PSA is a proteolytic enzyme that helps to liquefy the ejaculate several minutes after release from the male.
7.43.196	Prostate gland secretions account for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen.
7.43.197	The bulbourethral gland, or Cowper’s gland, releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen.
7.43.198	It neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine.
7.43.199	This usually accounts for a couple of drops of fluid in the total ejaculate and may contain a few sperm.
7.43.200	Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy may not work if sperm are present in the bulbourethral gland secretions.
7.43.201	The location and functions of the male reproductive organs are summarized in Table 43.1.
7.43.202	Female Reproductive Anatomy
7.43.203	A number of reproductive structures are exterior to the female’s body.
7.43.204	These include the breasts and the vulva, which consists of the mons pubis, clitoris, labia majora, labia minora, and the vestibular glands, all illustrated in Figure 43.10.
7.43.205	The location and functions of the female reproductive organs are summarized in Table 43.2.
7.43.206	The vulva is an area associated with the vestibule which includes the structures found in the inguinal (groin) area of women.
7.43.207	The mons pubis is a round, fatty area that overlies the pubic symphysis.
7.43.208	The clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse.
7.43.209	The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva.
7.43.210	The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male.
7.43.211	The labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora.
7.43.212	These labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra.
7.43.213	The mons pubis and the anterior portion of the labia majora become covered with hair during adolescence; the labia minora is hairless.
7.43.214	The greater vestibular glands are found at the sides of the vaginal opening and provide lubrication during intercourse.
7.43.215	The reproductive structures of the human female are shown.
7.43.216	The breasts consist of mammary glands and fat.
7.43.217	The size of the breast is determined by the amount of fat deposited behind the gland.
7.43.218	Each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts that empty at the nipple and that supply the nursing child with nutrient- and antibody-rich milk to aid development and protect the child.
7.43.219	Internal female reproductive structures include ovaries, oviducts, the uterus, and the vagina, shown in Figure 43.10.
7.43.220	The pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments.
7.43.221	Ovaries consist of a medulla and cortex: the medulla contains nerves and blood vessels to supply the cortex with nutrients and remove waste.
7.43.222	The outer layers of cells of the cortex are the functional parts of the ovaries.
7.43.223	The cortex is made up of follicular cells that surround eggs that develop during fetal development in utero.
7.43.224	During the menstrual period, a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares the eggs for release.
7.43.225	At ovulation, one follicle ruptures and one egg is released, as illustrated in Figure 43.11a.
7.43.226	Oocytes develop in (a) follicles, located in the ovary.
7.43.227	At the beginning of the menstrual cycle, the follicle matures.
7.43.228	At ovulation, the follicle ruptures, releasing the egg.
7.43.229	The follicle becomes a corpus luteum, which eventually degenerates.
7.43.230	The (b) follicle in this light micrograph has an oocyte at its center.
7.43.231	The oviducts, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries, but they are not in contact with the ovaries.
7.43.232	The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of fingerlike projections called fimbriae, illustrated in Figure 43.10b.
7.43.233	When an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the non-motile egg enter into the tube and passage to the uterus.
7.43.234	The walls of the oviducts are ciliated and are made up mostly of smooth muscle.
7.43.235	The cilia beat toward the middle, and the smooth muscle contracts in the same direction, moving the egg toward the uterus.
7.43.236	Fertilization usually takes place within the oviducts and the developing embryo is moved toward the uterus for development.
7.43.237	It usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct.
7.43.238	Sterilization in women is called a tubal ligation; it is analogous to a vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed.
7.43.239	The uterus is a structure about the size of a woman’s fist.
7.43.240	This is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and mucus glands.
7.43.241	The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation.
7.43.242	The thickest portion of the wall of the uterus is made of smooth muscle.
7.43.243	Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in passing the baby through the vagina during labor.
7.43.244	A portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each menstrual period, and then builds up again in preparation for an implantation.
7.43.245	Part of the uterus, called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina.
7.43.246	The cervix functions as the birth canal.
7.43.247	The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes.
7.43.248	It allows menstrual flow to leave the body.
7.43.249	It is the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and the vessel for the delivery of offspring.
7.43.250	It is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells to protect the underlying tissue.
7.43.251	Sexual Response during Intercourse
7.43.252	The sexual response in humans is both psychological and physiological.
7.43.253	Both sexes experience sexual arousal through psychological and physical stimulation.
7.43.254	There are four phases of the sexual response.
7.43.255	During phase one, called excitement, vasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues in both men and women.
7.43.256	The nipples, clitoris, labia, and penis engorge with blood and become enlarged.
7.43.257	Vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse.
7.43.258	During the second phase, called the plateau, stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing and heart rate increase.
7.43.259	During phase three, or orgasm, rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur in both sexes.
7.43.260	In the male, the reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the penis.
7.43.261	In women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each.
7.43.262	During phase four, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state.
7.43.263	Men experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours.
7.43.264	Gametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis)
7.43.265	Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, takes place through the process of meiosis.
7.43.266	During meiosis, two cell divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier stage of the cell’s life cycle.
7.43.267	Meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells.
7.43.268	The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis.
7.43.269	Spermatogenesis
7.43.270	During spermatogenesis, four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte.
7.43.271	Spermatogenesis, illustrated in Figure 43.12, occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules (Figure 43.8), with stem cells at the periphery of the tube and the spermatozoa at the lumen of the tube.
7.43.272	Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid, undifferentiated cells.
7.43.273	These stem cells, called spermatogonia (singular: spermatagonium), go through mitosis with one offspring going on to differentiate into a sperm cell and the other giving rise to the next generation of sperm.
7.43.274	Meiosis starts with a cell called a primary spermatocyte.
7.43.275	At the end of the first meiotic division, a haploid cell is produced called a secondary spermatocyte.
7.43.276	This cell is haploid and must go through another meiotic cell division.
7.43.277	The cell produced at the end of meiosis is called a spermatid and when it reaches the lumen of the tubule and grows a flagellum, it is called a sperm cell.
7.43.278	Four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.
7.43.279	Stem cells are deposited during gestation and are present at birth through the beginning of adolescence, but in an inactive state.
7.43.280	During adolescence, gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary cause the activation of these cells and the production of viable sperm.
7.43.281	This continues into old age.
7.43.282	Oogenesis Oogenesis, illustrated in Figure 43.13, occurs in the outermost layers of the ovaries.
7.43.283	As with sperm production, oogenesis starts with a germ cell, called an oogonium (plural: oogonia), but this cell undergoes mitosis to increase in number, eventually resulting in up to about one to two million cells in the embryo.
7.43.284	The process of oogenesis occurs in the ovary’s outermost layer.
7.43.285	The cell starting meiosis is called a primary oocyte, as shown in Figure 43.13.
7.43.286	This cell will start the first meiotic division and be arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage.
7.43.287	At the time of birth, all future eggs are in the prophase stage.
7.43.288	At adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a number of follicles in an ovary.
7.43.289	This results in the primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division.
7.43.290	The cell divides unequally, with most of the cellular material and organelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm going to the other cell.
7.43.291	This second cell is called a polar body and usually dies.
7.43.292	A secondary meiotic arrest occurs, this time at the metaphase II stage.
7.43.293	At ovulation, this secondary oocyte will be released and travel toward the uterus through the oviduct.
7.43.294	If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through the meiosis II, producing a second polar body and a fertilized egg containing all 46 chromosomes of a human being, half of them coming from the sperm.
7.43.295	Egg production begins before birth, is arrested during meiosis until puberty, and then individual cells continue through at each menstrual cycle.
7.43.296	One egg is produced from each meiotic process, with the extra chromosomes and chromatids going into polar bodies that degenerate and are reabsorbed by the body.
7.43.297	Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction
7.43.298	By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: Describe the roles of male and female reproductive hormones Discuss the interplay of the ovarian and menstrual cycles Describe the process of menopause
7.43.299	The human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs.
7.43.300	In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland.
7.43.301	When the reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to the anterior pituitary.
7.43.302	This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary into the blood.
7.43.303	Note that the body must reach puberty in order for the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for GnRH to be produced.
7.43.304	Although FSH and LH are named after their functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction.
7.43.305	Other hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems.
7.43.306	Male Hormones
7.43.307	At the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time.
7.43.308	FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback, as illustrated in Figure 43.14.
7.43.309	LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood.
7.43.310	Testosterone, the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence, stimulates spermatogenesis.
7.43.311	These secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial, axillary, and pubic hair, and the beginnings of the sex drive.
7.43.312	Hormones control sperm production in a negative feedback system.
7.43.313	A negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH.
7.43.314	The Sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin, which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high.
7.43.315	This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down.
7.43.316	If the sperm count reaches 20 million/ml, the Sertoli cells cease the release of inhibin, and the sperm count increases.
7.43.317	Female Hormones
7.43.318	The control of reproduction in females is more complex.
7.43.319	As with the male, the anterior pituitary hormones cause the release of the hormones FSH and LH.
7.43.320	In addition, estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles.
7.43.321	Estrogen is the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth, ovulation, and calcium absorption; it is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females.
7.43.322	These include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation.
7.43.323	Progesterone assists in endometrial re-growth and inhibition of FSH and LH release.
7.43.324	In females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles.
7.43.325	Follicle cells produce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production.
7.43.326	LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries.
7.43.327	Estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy.
7.43.328	Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both estradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.
7.43.329	The Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle
7.43.330	The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining.
7.43.331	These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22–32 day cycle, with an average length of 28 days.
7.43.332	The first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase shown in Figure 43.15.
7.43.333	Slowly rising levels of FSH and LH cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary.
7.43.334	This process prepares the egg for ovulation.
7.43.335	As the follicles grow, they begin releasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone.
7.43.336	Progesterone maintains the endometrium to help ensure pregnancy.
7.43.337	The trip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days.
7.43.338	At this stage of development, called the morula, there are 30-60 cells.
7.43.339	If pregnancy implantation does not occur, the lining is sloughed off.
7.43.340	After about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase.
7.43.341	The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated during the end of the last cycle.
7.43.342	Just prior to the middle of the cycle (approximately day 14), the high level of estrogen causes FSH and especially LH to rise rapidly, then fall.
7.43.343	The spike in LH causes ovulation: the most mature follicle, like that shown in Figure 43.16, ruptures and releases its egg.
7.43.344	The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost.
7.43.345	The level of estrogen decreases when the extra follicles degenerate.
7.43.346	This mature egg follicle may rupture and release an egg.
7.43.347	Following ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase, illustrated in Figure 43.15 and the menstrual cycle enters its secretory phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28.
7.43.348	The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured follicle.
7.43.349	The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum.
7.43.350	The corpus luteum produces estrogen and progesterone.
7.43.351	The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of further FSH and LH.
7.43.352	The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle.
7.43.353	The inhibition of FSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated.
7.43.354	The level of estrogen produced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days.
7.43.355	If no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease.
7.43.356	The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle.
7.43.357	The decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and starting the cycles again.
7.43.358	Figure 43.17 visually compares the ovarian and uterine cycles as well as the commensurate hormone levels.
7.43.359	Menopause
7.43.360	As women approach their mid-40s to mid-50s, their ovaries begin to lose their sensitivity to FSH and LH.
7.43.361	Menstrual periods become less frequent and finally cease; this is menopause.
7.43.362	There are still eggs and potential follicles on the ovaries, but without the stimulation of FSH and LH, they will not produce a viable egg to be released.
7.43.363	The outcome of this is the inability to have children.
7.43.364	The side effects of menopause include hot flashes, heavy sweating (especially at night), headaches, some hair loss, muscle pain, vaginal dryness, insomnia, depression, weight gain, and mood swings.
7.43.365	Estrogen is involved in calcium metabolism and, without it, blood levels of calcium decrease.
7.43.366	To replenish the blood, calcium is lost from bone which may decrease the bone density and lead to osteoporosis.
7.43.367	Supplementation of estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can prevent bone loss, but the therapy can have negative side effects.
7.43.368	While HRT is thought to give some protection from colon cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease, macular degeneration, and possibly depression, its negative side effects include increased risk of: stroke or heart attack, blood clots, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gall bladder disease, and possibly dementia.
7.43.369	Human Pregnancy and Birth
7.43.370	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain fetal development during the three trimesters of gestation Describe labor and delivery Compare the efficacy and duration of various types of contraception Discuss causes of infertility and the therapeutic options available Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual.
7.43.371	The length of time of gestation varies among animals, but is very similar among the great apes: human gestation is 266 days, while chimpanzee gestation is 237 days, a gorilla’s is 257 days, and orangutan gestation is 260 days long.
7.43.372	The fox has a 57-day gestation.
7.43.373	Dogs and cats have similar gestations averaging 60 days.
7.43.374	The longest gestation for a land mammal is an African elephant at 640 days.
7.43.375	The longest gestations among marine mammals are the beluga and sperm whales at 460 days.
7.43.376	Human Gestation
7.43.377	Twenty-four hours before fertilization, the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature oocyte.
7.43.378	When fertilized (at conception) the egg becomes known as a zygote.
7.43.379	The zygote travels through the oviduct to the uterus (Figure 43.18).
7.43.380	The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die.
7.43.381	The outer layers of the zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue.
7.43.382	Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active.
7.43.383	This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo.
7.43.384	Pregnancy tests determine the level of β-HCG in urine or serum.
7.43.385	If the hormone is present, the test is positive.
7.43.386	In humans, fertilization occurs soon after the oocyte leaves the ovary.
7.43.387	Implantation occurs eight or nine days later.
7.43.388	The gestation period is divided into three equal periods or trimesters.
7.43.389	During the first two to four weeks of the first trimester, nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion.
7.43.390	As the trimester progresses, the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium, and the placenta forms.
7.43.391	This organ takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus, with the mother’s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it.
7.43.392	Chemicals from the fetus, such as bilirubin, are processed by the mother’s liver for elimination.
7.43.393	Some of the mother’s immunoglobulins will pass through the placenta, providing passive immunity against some potential infections.
7.43.394	Internal organs and body structures begin to develop during the first trimester.
7.43.395	By five weeks, limb buds, eyes, the heart, and liver have been basically formed.
7.43.396	By eight weeks, the term fetus applies, and the body is essentially formed, as shown in Figure 43.19.
7.43.397	The individual is about five centimeters (two inches) in length and many of the organs, such as the lungs and liver, are not yet functioning.
7.43.398	Exposure to any toxins is especially dangerous during the first trimester, as all of the body’s organs and structures are going through initial development.
7.43.399	Anything that affects that development can have a severe effect on the fetus’ survival.
7.43.400	Fetal development is shown at nine weeks gestation.
7.43.401	During the second trimester, the fetus grows to about 30 cm (12 inches), as shown in Figure 43.20.
7.43.402	It becomes active and the mother usually feels the first movements.
7.43.403	All organs and structures continue to develop.
7.43.404	The placenta has taken over the functions of nutrition and waste and the production of estrogen and progesterone from the corpus luteum, which has degenerated.
7.43.405	The placenta will continue functioning up through the delivery of the baby.
7.43.406	This fetus is just entering the second trimester, when the placenta takes over more of the functions performed as the baby develops.
7.43.407	During the third trimester, the fetus grows to 3 to 4 kg (6 ½ -8 ½ lbs.) and about 50 cm (19-20 inches) long, as illustrated in Figure 43.21.
7.43.408	This is the period of the most rapid growth during the pregnancy.
7.43.409	Organ development continues to birth (and some systems, such as the nervous system and liver, continue to develop after birth).
7.43.410	The mother will be at her most uncomfortable during this trimester.
7.43.411	She may urinate frequently due to pressure on the bladder from the fetus.
7.43.412	There may also be intestinal blockage and circulatory problems, especially in her legs.
7.43.413	Clots may form in her legs due to pressure from the fetus on returning veins as they enter the abdominal cavity.
7.43.414	There is rapid fetal growth during the third trimester.
7.43.415	Labor and Birth Labor is the physical efforts of expulsion of the fetus and the placenta from the uterus during birth (parturition).
7.43.416	Toward the end of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin.
7.43.417	At this time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening).
7.43.418	This causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals for the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary.
7.43.419	The oxytocin causes the smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract.
7.43.420	At the same time, the placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions.
7.43.421	A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin.
7.43.422	As more smooth muscle cells are recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force.
7.43.423	There are three stages to labor.
7.43.424	During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates.
7.43.425	This is necessary for the baby and placenta to be expelled during birth.
7.43.426	The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm.
7.43.427	During stage two, the baby is expelled from the uterus.
7.43.428	The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery.
7.43.429	The last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall.
7.43.430	If labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as Pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain labor.
7.43.431	An alternative to labor and delivery is the surgical delivery of the baby through a procedure called a Caesarian section.
7.43.432	This is major abdominal surgery and can lead to post-surgical complications for the mother, but in some cases it may be the only way to safely deliver the baby.
7.43.433	The mother’s mammary glands go through changes during the third trimester to prepare for lactation and breastfeeding.
7.43.434	When the baby begins suckling at the breast, signals are sent to the hypothalamus causing the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary.
7.43.435	Prolactin causes the mammary glands to produce milk.
7.43.436	Oxytocin is also released, promoting the release of the milk.
7.43.437	The milk contains nutrients for the baby’s development and growth as well as immunoglobulins to protect the child from bacterial and viral infections.
7.43.438	Contraception and Birth Control
7.43.439	The prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control.
7.43.440	Strictly speaking, contraception refers to preventing the sperm and egg from joining.
7.43.441	Both terms are, however, frequently used interchangeably.
7.43.442	Table 43.3 lists common methods of contraception.
7.43.443	The failure rates listed are not the ideal rates that could be realized, but the typical rates that occur.
7.43.444	A failure rate is the number of pregnancies resulting from the method’s use over a twelve-month period.
7.43.445	Barrier methods, such as condoms, cervical caps, and diaphragms, block sperm from entering the uterus, preventing fertilization.
7.43.446	Spermicides are chemicals that are placed in the vagina that kill sperm.
7.43.447	Sponges, which are saturated with spermicides, are placed in the vagina at the cervical opening.
7.43.448	Combinations of spermicidal chemicals and barrier methods achieve lower failure rates than do the methods when used separately.
7.43.449	Nearly a quarter of the couples using barrier methods, natural family planning, or withdrawal can expect a failure of the method.
7.43.450	Natural family planning is based on the monitoring of the menstrual cycle and having intercourse only during times when the egg is not available.
7.43.451	A woman’s body temperature may rise a degree Celsius at ovulation and the cervical mucus may increase in volume and become more pliable.
7.43.452	These changes give a general indication of when intercourse is more or less likely to result in fertilization.
7.43.453	Withdrawal involves the removal of the penis from the vagina during intercourse, before ejaculation occurs.
7.43.454	This is a risky method with a high failure rate due to the possible presence of sperm in the bulbourethral gland’s secretion, which may enter the vagina prior to removing the penis.
7.43.455	Hormonal methods use synthetic progesterone (sometimes in combination with estrogen), to inhibit the hypothalamus from releasing FSH or LH, and thus prevent an egg from being available for fertilization.
7.43.456	The method of administering the hormone affects failure rate.
7.43.457	The most reliable method, with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, is the implantation of the hormone under the skin.
7.43.458	The same rate can be achieved through the sterilization procedures of vasectomy in the man or of tubal ligation in the woman, or by using an intrauterine device (IUD).
7.43.459	IUDs are inserted into the uterus and establish an inflammatory condition that prevents fertilized eggs from implanting into the uterine wall.
7.43.460	Compliance with the contraceptive method is a strong contributor to the success or failure rate of any particular method.
7.43.461	The only method that is completely effective at preventing conception is abstinence.
7.43.462	The choice of contraceptive method depends on the goals of the woman or couple.
7.43.463	Tubal ligation and vasectomy are considered permanent prevention, while other methods are reversible and provide short-term contraception.
7.43.464	Termination of an existing pregnancy can be spontaneous or voluntary.
7.43.465	Spontaneous termination is a miscarriage and usually occurs very early in the pregnancy, usually within the first few weeks.
7.43.466	This occurs when the fetus cannot develop properly and the gestation is naturally terminated.
7.43.467	Voluntary termination of a pregnancy is an abortion.
7.43.468	Laws regulating abortion vary between states and tend to view fetal viability as the criteria for allowing or preventing the procedure.
7.43.469	Infertility Infertility is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth.
7.43.470	About 75 percent of causes of infertility can be identified; these include diseases, such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the reproductive tubes in either men or women, or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone levels in one of the individuals.
7.43.471	Inadequate nutrition, especially starvation, can delay menstruation.
7.43.472	Stress can also lead to infertility.
7.43.473	Short-term stress can affect hormone levels, while long-term stress can delay puberty and cause less frequent menstrual cycles.
7.43.474	Other factors that affect fertility include toxins (such as cadmium), tobacco smoking, marijuana use, gonadal injuries, and aging.
7.43.475	If infertility is identified, several assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are available to aid conception.
7.43.476	A common type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF) where an egg and sperm are combined outside the body and then placed in the uterus.
7.43.477	Eggs are obtained from the woman after extensive hormonal treatments that prepare mature eggs for fertilization and prepare the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg.
7.43.478	Sperm are obtained from the man and they are combined with the eggs and supported through several cell divisions to ensure viability of the zygotes.
7.43.479	When the embryos have reached the eight-cell stage, one or more is implanted into the woman’s uterus.
7.43.480	If fertilization is not accomplished by simple IVF, a procedure that injects the sperm into an egg can be used.
7.43.481	This is called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and is shown in Figure 43.22.
7.43.482	IVF procedures produce a surplus of fertilized eggs and embryos that can be frozen and stored for future use.
7.43.483	The procedures can also result in multiple births.
7.43.484	A sperm is inserted into an egg for fertilization during intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
7.43.485	The process in which an organism develops from a single-celled zygote to a multi-cellular organism is complex and wellregulated.
7.43.486	The early stages of embryonic development are also crucial for ensuring the fitness of the organism.
7.43.487	Fertilization Fertilization, pictured in Figure 43.23a is the process in which gametes (an egg and sperm) fuse to form a zygote.
7.43.488	The egg and sperm each contain one set of chromosomes.
7.43.489	To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes, only one sperm must fuse with one egg.
7.43.490	In mammals, the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida.
7.43.491	When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a series of biochemical events, called the acrosomal reactions, take place.
7.43.492	In placental mammals, the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane, as illustrated in Figure 43.23b.
7.43.493	The fusion of these two membranes creates an opening through which the sperm nucleus is transferred into the ovum.
7.43.494	The nuclear membranes of the egg and sperm break down and the two haploid genomes condense to form a diploid genome.
7.43.495	(a) Fertilization is the process in which sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote.
7.43.496	(b) Acrosomal reactions help the sperm degrade the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allow the sperm to transfer its nucleus.
7.43.497	To ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg, once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg membrane, the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg.
7.43.498	If this mechanism fails, multiple sperm can fuse with the egg, resulting in polyspermy.
7.43.499	The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies within a few days.
7.43.500	Cleavage and Blastula Stage
7.43.501	The development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form the blastula.
7.43.502	The rapid, multiple rounds of cell division are termed cleavage.
7.43.503	Cleavage is illustrated in (Figure 43.24a).
7.43.504	After the cleavage has produced over 100 cells, the embryo is called a blastula.
7.43.505	The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the blastoderm) surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel).
7.43.506	Mammals at this stage form a structure called the blastocyst, characterized by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula, shown in Figure 43.24b.
7.43.507	During cleavage, the cells divide without an increase in mass; that is, one large single-celled zygote divides into multiple smaller cells.
7.43.508	Each cell within the blastula is called a blastomere.
7.43.509	(a) During cleavage, the zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells without increasing in size.
7.43.510	(b)
7.43.511	The cells rearrange themselves to form a hollow ball with a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity called the blastula.
7.43.512	Cleavage can take place in two ways: holoblastic (total) cleavage or meroblastic (partial) cleavage.
7.43.513	The type of cleavage depends on the amount of yolk in the eggs.
7.43.514	In placental mammals (including humans) where nourishment is provided by the mother’s body, the eggs have a very small amount of yolk and undergo holoblastic cleavage.
7.43.515	Other species, such as birds, with a lot of yolk in the egg to nourish the embryo during development, undergo meroblastic cleavage.
7.43.516	In mammals, the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development.
7.43.517	Here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers: the inner cell mass, and an outer layer called the trophoblast.
7.43.518	The inner cell mass is also known as the embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo.
7.43.519	At this stage of development, illustrated in Figure 43.25 the inner cell mass consists of embryonic stem cells that will differentiate into the different cell types needed by the organism.
7.43.520	The trophoblast will contribute to the placenta and nourish the embryo.
7.43.521	The rearrangement of the cells in the mammalian blastula to two layers—the inner cell mass and the trophoblast—results in the formation of the blastocyst.
7.43.522	Gastrulation
7.43.523	The typical blastula is a ball of cells.
7.43.524	The next stage in embryonic development is the formation of the body plan.
7.43.525	The cells in the blastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells.
7.43.526	This process is called gastrulation.
7.43.527	During gastrulation, the blastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells.
7.43.528	Each of these layers is called a germ layer and each germ layer differentiates into different organ systems.
7.43.529	The three germs layers, shown in Figure 43.26, are the endoderm, the ectoderm, and the mesoderm.
7.43.530	The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermis.
7.43.531	The mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body.
7.43.532	The endoderm gives rise to columnar cells found in the digestive system and many internal organs.
7.43.533	The three germ layers give rise to different cell types in the animal body.
7.43.534	43.7 | Organogenesis and Vertebrate Formation
7.43.535	By the end of this section, you will be able to: •
7.43.536	Describe the process of organogenesis •
7.43.537	Identify the anatomical axes formed in vertebrates Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise, during further development, to the different organs in the animal body.
7.43.538	This process is called organogenesis.
7.43.539	Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the cells within the embryo.
7.43.540	Organogenesis Organs form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation.
7.43.541	During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells express specific sets of genes which will determine their ultimate cell type.
7.43.542	For example, some cells in the ectoderm will express the genes specific to skin cells.
7.43.543	As a result, these cells will differentiate into epidermal cells.
7.43.544	The process of differentiation is regulated by cellular signaling cascades.
7.43.545	Scientists study organogenesis extensively in the lab in fruit flies (Drosophila) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
7.43.546	Drosophila have segments along their bodies, and the patterning associated with the segment formation has allowed scientists to study which genes play important roles in organogenesis along the length of the embryo at different time points.
7.43.547	The nematode C.elegans has roughly 1000 somatic cells and scientists have studied the fate of each of these cells during their development in the nematode life cycle.
7.43.548	There is little variation in patterns of cell lineage between individuals, unlike in mammals where cell development from the embryo is dependent on cellular cues.
7.43.549	In vertebrates, one of the primary steps during organogenesis is the formation of the neural system.
7.43.550	The ectoderm forms epithelial cells and tissues, and neuronal tissues.
7.43.551	During the formation of the neural system, special signaling molecules called growth factors signal some cells at the edge of the ectoderm to become epidermis cells.
7.43.552	The remaining cells in the center form the neural plate.
7.43.553	If the signaling by growth factors were disrupted, then the entire ectoderm would differentiate into neural tissue.
7.43.554	The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube, as illustrated in Figure 43.28.
7.43.555	In further development, the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord.
7.43.556	The central region of the ectoderm forms the neural tube, which gives rise to the brain and the spinal cord.
7.43.557	The mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the animal body.
7.43.558	A spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells called somites with spaces between them.
7.43.559	The somites, illustrated in Figure 43.29 will further develop into the ribs, lungs, and segmental (spine) muscle.
7.43.560	The mesoderm also forms a structure called the notochord, which is rod-shaped and forms the central axis of the animal body.
7.43.561	In this five-week old human embryo, somites are segments along the length of the body.
7.43.562	Vertebrate Axis Formation
7.43.563	Even as the germ layers form, the ball of cells still retains its spherical shape.
7.43.564	However, animal bodies have lateral-medial (left-right), dorsal-ventral (back-belly), and anterior-posterior (head-feet) axes, illustrated in Figure 43.30.
7.43.565	Animal bodies have three axes for symmetry.
7.43.566	How are these established?
7.43.567	In one of the most seminal experiments ever to be carried out in developmental biology, Spemann and Mangold took dorsal cells from one embryo and transplanted them into the belly region of another embryo.
7.43.568	They found that the transplanted embryo now had two notochords: one at the dorsal site from the original cells and another at the transplanted site.
7.43.569	This suggested that the dorsal cells were genetically programmed to form the notochord and define the axis.
7.43.570	Since then, researchers have identified many genes that are responsible for axis formation.
7.43.571	Mutations in these genes leads to the loss of symmetry required for organism development.
7.43.572	Animal bodies have externally visible symmetry.
7.43.573	However, the internal organs are not symmetric.
7.43.574	For example, the heart is on the left side and the liver on the right.
7.43.575	The formation of the central left-right axis is an important process during development.
7.43.576	This internal asymmetry is established very early during development and involves many genes.
7.43.577	Research is still ongoing to fully understand the developmental implications of these genes.
7.44.0	The (a) deer tick carries the bacterium that produces Lyme disease in humans, often evident in (b) a symptomatic bull’s eye rash.
7.44.1	The (c) white-footed mouse is one well-known host to deer ticks carrying the Lyme disease bacterium.  
7.44.2	Why study ecology?
7.44.3	Perhaps you are interested in learning about the natural world and how living things have adapted to the physical conditions of their environment.
7.44.4	Or, perhaps you’re a future physician seeking to understand the connection between human health and ecology.
7.44.5	Humans are a part of the ecological landscape, and human health is one important part of human interaction with our physical and living environment.
7.44.6	Lyme disease, for instance, serves as one modern-day example of the connection between our health and the natural world (Figure 44.1).
7.44.7	More formally known as Lyme borreliosis, Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans when they are bitten by the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), which is the primary vector for this disease.
7.44.8	However, not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause Lyme disease in humans, and I. scapularis can have other hosts besides deer.
7.44.9	In fact, it turns out that the probability of infection depends on the type of host upon which the tick develops: a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do ticks that live on deer.
7.44.10	Knowledge about the environments and population densities in which the host species is abundant would help a physician or an epidemiologist better understand how Lyme disease is transmitted and how its incidence could be reduced.
7.44.11	he Scope of Ecology
7.44.12	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define ecology and the four levels of ecological research Describe examples of the ways in which ecology requires the integration of different scientific disciplines Distinguish between abiotic and biotic components of the environment Recognize the relationship between abiotic and biotic components of the environment Ecology is the study of the interactions of living organisms with their environment.
7.44.13	One core goal of ecology is to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment.
7.44.14	Attainment of this goal requires the integration of scientific disciplines inside and outside of biology, such as biochemistry, physiology, evolution, biodiversity, molecular biology, geology, and climatology.
7.44.15	Some ecological research also applies aspects of chemistry and physics, and it frequently uses mathematical models.
7.44.16	Levels of Ecological Study
7.44.17	When a discipline such as biology is studied, it is often helpful to subdivide it into smaller, related areas.
7.44.18	For instance, cell biologists interested in cell signaling need to understand the chemistry of the signal molecules (which are usually proteins) as well as the result of cell signaling.
7.44.19	Ecologists interested in the factors that influence the survival of an endangered species might use mathematical models to predict how current conservation efforts affect endangered organisms.
7.44.20	To produce a sound set of management options, a conservation biologist needs to collect accurate data, including current population size, factors affecting reproduction (like physiology and behavior), habitat requirements (such as plants and soils), and potential human influences on the endangered population and its habitat (which might be derived through studies in sociology and urban ecology).
7.44.21	Within the discipline of ecology, researchers work at four specific levels, sometimes discretely and sometimes with overlap: organism, population, community, and ecosystem.
7.44.22	Ecologists study within several biological levels of organization.
7.44.23	Organismal Ecology Researchers studying ecology at the organismal level are interested in the adaptations that enable individuals to live in specific habitats.
7.44.24	These adaptations can be morphological, physiological, and behavioral.
7.44.25	For instance, the Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) (Figure 44.3) is considered a specialist because the females preferentially oviposit (that is, lay eggs) on wild lupine.
7.44.26	This preferential adaptation means that the Karner blue butterfly is highly dependent on the presence of wild lupine plants for its continued survival.
7.44.27	The Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) is a rare butterfly that lives only in open areas with few trees or shrubs, such as pine barrens and oak savannas.
7.44.28	It can only lay its eggs on lupine plants.
7.44.29	After hatching, the larval caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine (Figure 44.4).
7.44.30	The caterpillars pupate (undergo metamorphosis) and emerge as butterflies after about four weeks.
7.44.31	The adult butterflies feed on the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other plant species.
7.44.32	A researcher interested in studying Karner blue butterflies at the organismal level might, in addition to asking questions about egg laying, ask questions about the butterflies’ preferred temperature (a physiological question) or the behavior of the caterpillars when they are at different larval stages (a behavioral question).
7.44.33	The wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) is the host plant for the Karner blue butterfly.
7.44.34	Population Ecology
7.44.35	A population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same time.
7.44.36	(Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics.)
7.44.37	A population is identified, in part, by where it lives, and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries: natural boundaries might be rivers, mountains, or deserts, while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass, manmade structures, or roads.
7.44.38	The study of population ecology focuses on the number of individuals in an area and how and why population size changes over time.
7.44.39	Population ecologists are particularly interested in counting the Karner blue butterfly, for example, because it is classified as federally endangered.
7.44.40	However, the distribution and density of this species is highly influenced by the distribution and abundance of wild lupine.
7.44.41	Researchers might ask questions about the factors leading to the decline of wild lupine and how these affect Karner blue butterflies.
7.44.42	For example, ecologists know that wild lupine thrives in open areas where trees and shrubs are largely absent.
7.44.43	In natural settings, intermittent wildfires regularly remove trees and shrubs, helping to maintain the open areas that wild lupine requires.
7.44.44	Mathematical models can be used to understand how wildfire suppression by humans has led to the decline of this important plant for the Karner blue butterfly.
7.44.45	Community Ecology
7.44.46	A biological community consists of the different species within an area, typically a three-dimensional space, and the interactions within and among these species.
7.44.47	Community ecologists are interested in the processes driving these interactions and their consequences.
7.44.48	Questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same species for a limited resource.
7.44.49	Ecologists also study interactions among various species; members of different species are called heterospecifics.
7.44.50	Examples of heterospecific interactions include predation, parasitism, herbivory, competition, and pollination.
7.44.51	These interactions can have regulating effects on population sizes and can impact ecological and evolutionary processes affecting diversity.
7.44.52	For example, Karner blue butterfly larvae form mutualistic relationships with ants.
7.44.53	Mutualism is a form of a longterm relationship that has coevolved between two species and from which each species benefits.
7.44.54	For mutualism to exist between individual organisms, each species must receive some benefit from the other as a consequence of the relationship.
7.44.55	Researchers have shown that there is an increase in the probability of survival when Karner blue butterfly larvae (caterpillars) are tended by ants.
7.44.56	This might be because the larvae spend less time in each life stage when tended by ants, which provides an advantage for the larvae.
7.44.57	Meanwhile, the Karner blue butterfly larvae secrete a carbohydraterich substance that is an important energy source for the ants.
7.44.58	Both the Karner blue larvae and the ants benefit from their interaction.
7.44.59	Ecosystem Ecology Ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal, population, and community ecology.
7.44.60	The ecosystem is composed of all the biotic components (living things) in an area along with the abiotic components (non-living things) of that area.
7.44.61	Some of the abiotic components include air, water, and soil.
7.44.62	Ecosystem biologists ask questions about how nutrients and energy are stored and how they move among organisms and the surrounding atmosphere, soil, and water.
7.44.63	The Karner blue butterflies and the wild lupine live in an oak-pine barren habitat.
7.44.64	This habitat is characterized by natural disturbance and nutrient-poor soils that are low in nitrogen.
7.44.65	The availability of nutrients is an important factor in the distribution of the plants that live in this habitat.
7.44.66	Researchers interested in ecosystem ecology could ask questions about the importance of limited resources and the movement of resources, such as nutrients, though the biotic and abiotic portions of the ecosystem.
7.44.67	Biogeography
7.44.68	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define biogeography List and describe abiotic factors that affect the global distribution of plant and animal species Compare the impact of abiotic forces on aquatic and terrestrial environments  
7.44.69	Summarize the affect of abiotic factors on net primary productivity
7.44.70	Many forces influence the communities of living organisms present in different parts of the biosphere (all of the parts of Earth inhabited by life).
7.44.71	The biosphere extends into the atmosphere (several kilometers above Earth) and into the depths of the oceans.
7.44.72	Despite its apparent vastness to an individual human, the biosphere occupies only a minute space when compared to the known universe.
7.44.73	Many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere.
7.44.74	The abiotic factors influence the distribution of biomes: large areas of land with similar climate, flora, and fauna.
7.44.75	Biogeography
7.44.76	Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution.
7.44.77	Abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation.
7.44.78	As these abiotic factors change, the composition of plant and animal communities also changes.
7.44.79	For example, if you were to begin a journey at the equator and walk north, you would notice gradual changes in plant communities.
7.44.80	At the beginning of your journey, you would see tropical wet forests with broad-leaved evergreen trees, which are characteristic of plant communities found near the equator.
7.44.81	As you continued to travel north, you would see these broad-leaved evergreen plants eventually give rise to seasonally dry forests with scattered trees.
7.44.82	You would also begin to notice changes in temperature and moisture.
7.44.83	At about 30 degrees north, these forests would give way to deserts, which are characterized by low precipitation.
7.44.84	Moving farther north, you would see that deserts are replaced by grasslands or prairies.
7.44.85	Eventually, grasslands are replaced by deciduous temperate forests.
7.44.86	These deciduous forests give way to the boreal forests found in the subarctic, the area south of the Arctic Circle.
7.44.87	Finally, you would reach the Arctic tundra, which is found at the most northern latitudes.
7.44.88	This trek north reveals gradual changes in both climate and the types of organisms that have adapted to environmental factors associated with ecosystems found at different latitudes.
7.44.89	However, different ecosystems exist at the same latitude due in part to abiotic factors such as jet streams, the Gulf Stream, and ocean currents.
7.44.90	If you were to hike up a mountain, the changes you would see in the vegetation would parallel those as you move to higher latitudes.
7.44.91	Ecologists who study biogeography examine patterns of species distribution.
7.44.92	No species exists everywhere; for example, the Venus flytrap is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina.
7.44.93	An endemic species is one which is naturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size.
7.44.94	Other species are generalists: species which live in a wide variety of geographic areas; the raccoon, for example, is native to most of North and Central America.
7.44.95	Species distribution patterns are based on biotic and abiotic factors and their influences during the very long periods of time required for species evolution; therefore, early studies of biogeography were closely linked to the emergence of evolutionary thinking in the eighteenth century.
7.44.96	Some of the most distinctive assemblages of plants and animals occur in regions that have been physically separated for millions of years by geographic barriers.
7.44.97	Biologists estimate that Australia, for example, has between 600,000 and 700,000 species of plants and animals.
7.44.98	Approximately 3/4 of living plant and mammal species are endemic species found solely in Australia (Figure 44.6ab).
7.44.99	Australia is home to many endemic species.
7.44.100	The (a) wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), a medium-sized member of the kangaroo family, is a pouched mammal, or marsupial.
7.44.101	The (b) echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is an egg-laying mammal.
7.44.102	Sometimes ecologists discover unique patterns of species distribution by determining where species are not found.
7.44.103	Hawaii, for example, has no native land species of reptiles or amphibians, and has only one native terrestrial mammal, the hoary bat.
7.44.104	Most of New Guinea, as another example, lacks placental mammals.
7.44.105	Plants can be endemic or generalists: endemic plants are found only on specific regions of the Earth, while generalists are found on many regions.
7.44.106	Isolated land masses—such as Australia, Hawaii, and Madagascar—often have large numbers of endemic plant species.
7.44.107	Some of these plants are endangered due to human activity.
7.44.108	The forest gardenia (Gardenia brighamii), for instance, is endemic to Hawaii; only an estimated 15–20 trees are thought to exist.
7.44.109	Listed as federally endangered, the forest gardenia is a small tree with distinctive flowers.
7.44.110	It is found only in five of the Hawaiian Islands in small populations consisting of a few individual specimens.
7.44.111	Energy Sources Energy from the sun is captured by green plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic protists.
7.44.112	These organisms convert solar energy into the chemical energy needed by all living things.
7.44.113	Light availability can be an important force directly affecting the evolution of adaptations in photosynthesizers.
7.44.114	For instance, plants in the understory of a temperate forest are shaded when the trees above them in the canopy completely leaf out in the late spring.
7.44.115	Not surprisingly, understory plants have adaptations to successfully capture available light.
7.44.116	One such adaptation is the rapid growth of spring ephemeral plants such as the spring beauty (Figure 44.8).
7.44.117	These spring flowers achieve much of their growth and finish their life cycle (reproduce) early in the season before the trees in the canopy develop leaves.
7.44.118	The spring beauty is an ephemeral spring plant that flowers early in the spring to avoid competing with larger forest trees for sunlight.
7.44.119	In aquatic ecosystems, the availability of light may be limited because sunlight is absorbed by water, plants, suspended particles, and resident microorganisms.
7.44.120	Toward the bottom of a lake, pond, or ocean, there is a zone that light cannot reach.
7.44.121	Photosynthesis cannot take place there and, as a result, a number of adaptations have evolved that enable living things to survive without light.
7.44.122	For instance, aquatic plants have photosynthetic tissue near the surface of the water; for example, think of the broad, floating leaves of a water lily—water lilies cannot survive without light.
7.44.123	In environments such as hydrothermal vents, some bacteria extract energy from inorganic chemicals because there is no light for photosynthesis.
7.44.124	The availability of nutrients in aquatic systems is also an important aspect of energy or photosynthesis.
7.44.125	Many organisms sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die in the open water; when this occurs, the energy found in that living organism is sequestered for some time unless ocean upwelling occurs.
7.44.126	Ocean upwelling is the rising of deep ocean waters that occurs when prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a coastline (Figure 44.9).
7.44.127	As the wind pushes ocean waters offshore, water from the bottom of the ocean moves up to replace this water.
7.44.128	As a result, the nutrients once contained in dead organisms become available for reuse by other living organisms.
7.44.129	Ocean upwelling is an important process that recycles nutrients and energy in the ocean.
7.44.130	As wind (green arrows) pushes offshore, it causes water from the ocean bottom (red arrows) to move to the surface, bringing up nutrients from the ocean depths.
7.44.131	In freshwater systems, the recycling of nutrients occurs in response to air temperature changes.
7.44.132	The nutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year: in the spring and fall turnover.
7.44.133	The spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water (Figure 44.10).
7.44.134	These turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline: a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers.
7.44.135	In wintertime, the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen.
7.44.136	However, the water under the ice is slightly warmer, and the water at the bottom of the lake is warmer yet at 4 °C to 5 °C (39.2 °F to 41 °F).
7.44.137	Water is densest at 4 °C; therefore, the deepest water is also the densest.
7.44.138	The deepest water is oxygen poor because the decomposition of organic material at the bottom of the lake uses up available oxygen that cannot be replaced by means of oxygen diffusion into the water due to the surface ice layer.
7.44.139	In springtime, air temperatures increase and surface ice melts.
7.44.140	When the temperature of the surface water begins to reach 4 °C, the water becomes heavier and sinks to the bottom.
7.44.141	The water at the bottom of the lake is then displaced by the heavier surface water and, thus, rises to the top.
7.44.142	As that water rises to the top, the sediments and nutrients from the lake bottom are brought along with it.
7.44.143	During the summer months, the lake water stratifies, or forms layers, with the warmest water at the lake surface.
7.44.144	As air temperatures drop in the fall, the temperature of the lake water cools to 4 °C; therefore, this causes fall turnover as the heavy cold water sinks and displaces the water at the bottom.
7.44.145	The oxygen-rich water at the surface of the lake then moves to the bottom of the lake, while the nutrients at the bottom of the lake rise to the surface (Figure 44.10).
7.44.146	During the winter, the oxygen at the bottom of the lake is used by decomposers and other organisms requiring oxygen, such as fish.
7.44.147	Temperature Temperature affects the physiology of living things as well as the density and state of water.
7.44.148	Temperature exerts an important influence on living things because few living things can survive at temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) due to metabolic constraints.
7.44.149	It is also rare for living things to survive at temperatures exceeding 45 °C (113 °F); this is a reflection of evolutionary response to typical temperatures.
7.44.150	Enzymes are most efficient within a narrow and specific range of temperatures; enzyme degradation can occur at higher temperatures.
7.44.151	Therefore, organisms either must maintain an internal temperature or they must inhabit an environment that will keep the body within a temperature range that supports metabolism.
7.44.152	Some animals have adapted to enable their bodies to survive significant temperature fluctuations, such as seen in hibernation or reptilian torpor.
7.44.153	Similarly, some bacteria are adapted to surviving in extremely hot temperatures such as geysers.
7.44.154	Such bacteria are examples of extremophiles: organisms that thrive in extreme environments.
7.44.155	Temperature can limit the distribution of living things.
7.44.156	Animals faced with temperature fluctuations may respond with adaptations, such as migration, in order to survive.
7.44.157	Migration, the movement from one place to another, is an adaptation found in many animals, including many that inhabit seasonally cold climates.
7.44.158	Migration solves problems related to temperature, locating food, and finding a mate.
7.44.159	In migration, for instance, the Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) makes a 40,000 km (24,000 mi) round trip flight each year between its feeding grounds in the southern hemisphere and its breeding grounds in the Arctic Ocean.
7.44.160	Monarch butterflies
7.44.161	(Danaus plexippus) live in the eastern United States in the warmer months and migrate to Mexico and the southern United States in the wintertime.
7.44.162	Some species of mammals also make migratory forays.
7.44.163	Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) travel about 5,000 km (3,100 mi) each year to find food.
7.44.164	Amphibians and reptiles are more limited in their distribution because they lack migratory ability.
7.44.165	Not all animals that can migrate do so: migration carries risk and comes at a high energy cost.
7.44.166	Some animals hibernate or estivate to survive hostile temperatures.
7.44.167	Hibernation enables animals to survive cold conditions, and estivation allows animals to survive the hostile conditions of a hot, dry climate.
7.44.168	Animals that hibernate or estivate enter a state known as torpor: a condition in which their metabolic rate is significantly lowered.
7.44.169	This enables the animal to wait until its environment better supports its survival.
7.44.170	Some amphibians, such as the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), have an antifreeze-like chemical in their cells, which retains the cells’ integrity and prevents them from bursting.
7.44.171	Water Water is required by all living things because it is critical for cellular processes.
7.44.172	Since terrestrial organisms lose water to the environment by simple diffusion, they have evolved many adaptations to retain water.
7.44.173	•
7.44.174	Plants have a number of interesting features on their leaves, such as leaf hairs and a waxy cuticle, that serve to decrease the rate of water loss via transpiration.
7.44.175	• Freshwater organisms are surrounded by water and are constantly in danger of having water rush into their cells because of osmosis.
7.44.176	Many adaptations of organisms living in freshwater environments have evolved to ensure that solute concentrations in their bodies remain within appropriate levels.
7.44.177	One such adaptation is the excretion of dilute urine.
7.44.178	•
7.44.179	Marine organisms are surrounded by water with a higher solute concentration than the organism and, thus, are in danger of losing water to the environment because of osmosis.
7.44.180	These organisms have morphological and physiological adaptations to retain water and release solutes into the environment.
7.44.181	For example, Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), sneeze out water vapor that is high in salt in order to maintain solute concentrations within an acceptable range while swimming in the ocean and eating marine plants.
7.44.182	Inorganic Nutrients and Soil Inorganic nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are important in the distribution and the abundance of living things.
7.44.183	Plants obtain these inorganic nutrients from the soil when water moves into the plant through the roots.
7.44.184	Therefore, soil structure (particle size of soil components), soil pH, and soil nutrient content play an important role in the distribution of plants.
7.44.185	Animals obtain inorganic nutrients from the food they consume.
7.44.186	Therefore, animal distributions are related to the distribution of what they eat.
7.44.187	In some cases, animals will follow their food resource as it moves through the environment.
7.44.188	Other Aquatic Factors
7.44.189	Some abiotic factors, such as oxygen, are important in aquatic ecosystems as well as terrestrial environments.
7.44.190	Terrestrial animals obtain oxygen from the air they breathe.
7.44.191	Oxygen availability can be an issue for organisms living at very high elevations, however, where there are fewer molecules of oxygen in the air.
7.44.192	In aquatic systems, the concentration of dissolved oxygen is related to water temperature and the speed at which the water moves.
7.44.193	Cold water has more dissolved oxygen than warmer water.
7.44.194	In addition, salinity, current, and tide can be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems.
7.44.195	Other Terrestrial Factors Wind can be an important abiotic factor because it influences the rate of evaporation and transpiration.
7.44.196	The physical force of wind is also important because it can move soil, water, or other abiotic factors, as well as an ecosystem’s organisms.
7.44.197	Fire is another terrestrial factor that can be an important agent of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems.
7.44.198	Some organisms are adapted to fire and, thus, require the high heat associated with fire to complete a part of their life cycle.
7.44.199	For example, the jack pine—a coniferous tree—requires heat from fire for its seed cones to open (Figure 44.11).
7.44.200	Through the burning of pine needles, fire adds nitrogen to the soil and limits competition by destroying undergrowth.
7.44.201	The mature cones of the jack pine (Pinus banksiana) open only when exposed to high temperatures, such as during a forest fire.
7.44.202	A fire is likely to kill most vegetation, so a seedling that germinates after a fire is more likely to receive ample sunlight than one that germinates under normal conditions.
7.44.203	Abiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic matter available as food (net primary productivity).
7.44.204	Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration.
7.44.205	In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots.
7.44.206	This means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement.
7.44.207	Net primary productivity is an important variable when considering differences in biomes.
7.44.208	Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground biomass.
7.44.209	Annual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment.
7.44.210	Environments with the greatest amount of biomass have conditions in which photosynthesis, plant growth, and the resulting net primary productivity are optimized.
7.44.211	The climate of these areas is warm and wet.
7.44.212	Photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work most efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production.
7.44.213	The aboveground biomass produces several important resources for other living things, including habitat and food.
7.44.214	Conversely, dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass.
7.44.215	The animal communities living there will also be affected by the decrease in available food.
7.44.216	Terrestrial Biomes
7.44.217	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify the two major abiotic factors that determine terrestrial biomes Recognize distinguishing characteristics of each of the eight major terrestrial biomes The Earth’s biomes are categorized into two major groups: terrestrial and aquatic.
7.44.218	Terrestrial biomes are based on land, while aquatic biomes include both ocean and freshwater biomes.
7.44.219	The eight major terrestrial biomes on Earth are each distinguished by characteristic temperatures and amount of precipitation.
7.44.220	Comparing the annual totals of precipitation and fluctuations in precipitation from one biome to another provides clues as to the importance of abiotic factors in the distribution of biomes.
7.44.221	Temperature variation on a daily and seasonal basis is also important for predicting the geographic distribution of the biome and the vegetation type in the biome.
7.44.222	The distribution of these biomes shows that the same biome can occur in geographically distinct areas with similar climates.
7.44.223	Tropical Wet Forest Tropical wet forests are also referred to as tropical rainforests.
7.44.224	This biome is found in equatorial regions (Figure 44.12).
7.44.225	The vegetation is characterized by plants with broad leaves that fall off throughout the year.
7.44.226	Unlike the trees of deciduous forests, the trees in this biome do not have a seasonal loss of leaves associated with variations in temperature and sunlight; these forests are
7.44.227	“
7.44.228	evergreen” year-round.
7.44.229	The temperature and sunlight profiles of tropical wet forests are very stable in comparison to that of other terrestrial biomes, with the temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 34 °C (68 °F to 93 °F).
7.44.230	When one compares the annual temperature variation of tropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes, the lack of seasonal temperature variation in the tropical wet forest becomes apparent.
7.44.231	This lack of seasonality leads to year-round plant growth, rather than the seasonal (spring, summer, and fall) growth seen in other biomes.
7.44.232	In contrast to other ecosystems, tropical ecosystems do not have long days and short days during the yearly cycle.
7.44.233	Instead, a constant daily amount of sunlight (11–12 hrs per day) provides more solar radiation, thereby, a longer period of time for plant growth.
7.44.234	The annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 to 660 cm (50–200 in) with some monthly variation.
7.44.235	While sunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent, annual rainfall is highly variable.
7.44.236	Tropical wet forests have wet months in which there can be more than 30 cm (11–12 in) of precipitation, as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10 cm (3.5 in) of rainfall.
7.44.237	However, the driest month of a tropical wet forest still exceeds the annual rainfall of some other biomes, such as deserts.
7.44.238	Tropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values in these areas are ideal for plant growth.
7.44.239	Therefore, the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest leads to plant communities with very high species diversities (Figure 44.13).
7.44.240	Tropical wet forests have more species of trees than any other biome; on average between 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a single hectare (2.5 acres) of South America.
7.44.241	One way to visualize this is to compare the distinctive horizontal layers within the tropical wet forest biome.
7.44.242	On the forest floor is a sparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter.
7.44.243	Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage.
7.44.244	A layer of trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopy—the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves.
7.44.245	Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy.
7.44.246	These layers provide diverse and complex habitats for the variety of plants, fungi, animals, and other organisms within the tropical wet forests.
7.44.247	For instance, epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants, which typically are not harmed.
7.44.248	Epiphytes are found throughout tropical wet forest biomes.
7.44.249	Many species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex structure of the tropical wet forests for food and shelter.
7.44.250	Some organisms live several meters above ground and have adapted to this arboreal lifestyle.
7.44.251	Tropical wet forests, such as these forests of Madre de Dios, Peru, near the Amazon River, have high species diversity.
7.44.252	Savannas Savannas are grasslands with scattered trees, and they are located in Africa, South America, and northern Australia
7.44.253	(Figure 44.12).
7.44.254	Savannas are hot, tropical areas with temperatures averaging from 24 °C to 29 °C (75 °F to 84 °F) and an annual rainfall of 10–40 cm (3.9–15.7 in).
7.44.255	Savannas have an extensive dry season; for this reason, forest trees do not grow as well as they do in the tropical wet forest (or other forest biomes).
7.44.256	As a result, within the grasses and forbs (herbaceous flowering plants) that dominate the savanna, there are relatively few trees (Figure 44.14).
7.44.257	Since fire is an important source of disturbance in this biome, plants have evolved well-developed root systems that allow them to quickly re-sprout after a fire.
7.44.258	Savannas, like this one in Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in Kenya, are dominated by grasses.
7.44.259	Subtropical Deserts Subtropical deserts exist between 15 ° and 30 ° north and south latitude and are centered on the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn (Figure 44.12).
7.44.260	This biome is very dry; in some years, evaporation exceeds precipitation.
7.44.261	Subtropical hot deserts can have daytime soil surface temperatures above 60 °C (140 °F) and nighttime temperatures approaching 0 °C (32 °F).
7.44.262	In cold deserts, temperatures can be as high as 25 °C and can drop below -30 °C (-22 °F).
7.44.263	Subtropical deserts are characterized by low annual precipitation of fewer than 30 cm (12 in) with little monthly variation and lack of predictability in rainfall.
7.44.264	In some cases, the annual rainfall can be as low as 2 cm (0.8 in) in subtropical deserts located in central Australia
7.44.265	(“the Outback”) and northern Africa.
7.44.266	The vegetation and low animal diversity of this biome is closely related to this low and unpredictable precipitation.
7.44.267	Very dry deserts lack perennial vegetation that lives from one year to the next; instead, many plants are annuals that grow quickly and reproduce when rainfall does occur, then they die.
7.44.268	Many other plants in these areas are characterized by having a number of adaptations that conserve water, such as deep roots, reduced foliage, and water-storing stems (Figure 44.15).
7.44.269	Seed plants in the desert produce seeds that can be in dormancy for extended periods between rains.
7.44.270	Adaptations in desert animals include nocturnal behavior and burrowing.
7.44.271	To reduce water loss, many desert plants have tiny leaves or no leaves at all.
7.44.272	The leaves of ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), shown here in the Sonora Desert near Gila Bend, Arizona, appear only after rainfall, and then are shed.
7.44.273	Chaparral
7.44.274	The chaparral is also called the scrub forest and is found in California, along the Mediterranean Sea, and along the southern coast of Australia (Figure 44.12).
7.44.275	The annual rainfall in this biome ranges from 65 cm to 75 cm (25.6–29.5 in), and the majority of the rain falls in the winter.
7.44.276	Summers are very dry and many chaparral plants are dormant during the summertime.
7.44.277	The chaparral vegetation, shown in Figure 44.16, is dominated by shrubs and is adapted to periodic fires, with some plants producing seeds that only germinate after a hot fire.
7.44.278	The ashes left behind after a fire are rich in nutrients like nitrogen that fertilize the soil and promote plant regrowth.
7.44.279	The chaparral is dominated by shrubs.
7.44.280	Temperate Grasslands Temperate grasslands are found throughout central North America, where they are also known as prairies; they are also in Eurasia, where they are known as steppes (Figure 44.12).
7.44.281	Temperate grasslands have pronounced annual fluctuations in temperature with hot summers and cold winters.
7.44.282	The annual temperature variation produces specific growing seasons for plants.
7.44.283	Plant growth is possible when temperatures are warm enough to sustain plant growth and when ample water is available, which occurs in the spring, summer, and fall.
7.44.284	During much of the winter, temperatures are low, and water, which is stored in the form of ice, is not available for plant growth.
7.44.285	Annual precipitation ranges from 25 cm to 75 cm (9.8–29.5 in).
7.44.286	Because of relatively lower annual precipitation in temperate grasslands, there are few trees except for those found growing along rivers or streams.
7.44.287	The dominant vegetation tends to consist of grasses and some prairies sustain populations of grazing animals Figure 44.17.
7.44.288	The vegetation is very dense and the soils are fertile because the subsurface of the soil is packed with the roots and rhizomes (underground stems) of these grasses.
7.44.289	The roots and rhizomes act to anchor plants into the ground and replenish the organic material (humus) in the soil when they die and decay.
7.44.290	The American bison (Bison bison), more commonly called the buffalo, is a grazing mammal that once populated American prairies in huge numbers.
7.44.291	Fires, mainly caused by lightning, are a natural disturbance in temperate grasslands.
7.44.292	When fire is suppressed in temperate grasslands, the vegetation eventually converts to scrub and dense forests.
7.44.293	Often, the restoration or management of temperate grasslands requires the use of controlled burns to suppress the growth of trees and maintain the grasses.
7.44.294	Temperate Forests Temperate forests are the most common biome in eastern North America, Western Europe, Eastern Asia, Chile, and New Zealand
7.44.295	(Figure 44.12).
7.44.296	This biome is found throughout mid-latitude regions.
7.44.297	Temperatures range between -30 °C and 30 °C (-22 °F to 86 °F) and drop to below freezing on an annual basis.
7.44.298	These temperatures mean that temperate forests have defined growing seasons during the spring, summer, and early fall.
7.44.299	Precipitation is relatively constant throughout the year and ranges between 75 cm and 150 cm (29.5–59 in).
7.44.300	Because of the moderate annual rainfall and temperatures, deciduous trees are the dominant plant in this biome (Figure 44.18).
7.44.301	Deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and remain leafless in the winter.
7.44.302	Thus, no photosynthesis occurs in the deciduous trees during the dormant winter period.
7.44.303	Each spring, new leaves appear as the temperature increases.
7.44.304	Because of the dormant period, the net primary productivity of temperate forests is less than that of tropical wet forests.
7.44.305	In addition, temperate forests show less diversity of tree species than tropical wet forest biomes.
7.44.306	Deciduous trees are the dominant plant in the temperate forest.
7.44.307	The trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground; however, this biome is more open than tropical wet forests because trees in the temperate forests do not grow as tall as the trees in tropical wet forests.
7.44.308	The soils of the temperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients.
7.44.309	This is due to the thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors.
7.44.310	As this leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned to the soil.
7.44.311	The leaf litter also protects soil from erosion, insulates the ground, and provides habitats for invertebrates (such as the pill bug or roly-poly, Armadillidium vulgare) and their predators, such as the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus).
7.44.312	Boreal Forests
7.44.313	The boreal forest, also known as taiga or coniferous forest, is found south of the Arctic Circle and across most of Canada, Alaska, Russia, and northern Europe (Figure 44.12).
7.44.314	This biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers.
7.44.315	The annual precipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm (15.7–39 in) and usually takes the form of snow.
7.44.316	Little evaporation occurs because of the cold temperatures.
7.44.317	The long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the predominance of cold-tolerant cone-bearing plants.
7.44.318	These are evergreen coniferous trees like pines, spruce, and fir, which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round.
7.44.319	Evergreen trees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees because less energy from the sun is required to warm a needle-like leaf than a broad leaf.
7.44.320	This benefits evergreen trees, which grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest.
7.44.321	In addition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen.
7.44.322	Leaves are a nitrogen-rich structure and deciduous trees must produce a new set of these nitrogen-rich structures each year.
7.44.323	Therefore, coniferous trees that retain nitrogen-rich needles may have a competitive advantage over the broad-leafed deciduous trees.
7.44.324	The net primary productivity of boreal forests is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical wet forests.
7.44.325	The aboveground biomass of boreal forests is high because these slow-growing tree species are long lived and accumulate standing biomass over time.
7.44.326	Plant species diversity is less than that seen in temperate forests and tropical wet forests.
7.44.327	Boreal forests lack the pronounced elements of the layered forest structure seen in tropical wet forests.
7.44.328	The structure of a boreal forest is often only a tree layer and a ground layer (Figure 44.19).
7.44.329	When conifer needles are dropped, they decompose more slowly than broad leaves; therefore, fewer nutrients are returned to the soil to fuel plant growth.
7.44.330	The boreal forest (taiga) has low lying plants and conifer trees.
7.44.331	Arctic Tundra
7.44.332	The Arctic tundra lies north of the subarctic boreal forest and is located throughout the Arctic regions of the northern hemisphere (Figure 44.12).
7.44.333	The average winter temperature is -34 °C (-34 °F) and the average summer temperature is from 3 °C to 12 °C (37 °F–52 °F).
7.44.334	Plants in the arctic tundra have a very short growing season of approximately 10–12 weeks.
7.44.335	However, during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid.
7.44.336	The annual precipitation of the Arctic tundra is very low with little annual variation in precipitation.
7.44.337	And, as in the boreal forests, there is little evaporation due to the cold temperatures.
7.44.338	Plants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground (Figure 44.20).
7.44.339	There is little species diversity, low net primary productivity, and low aboveground biomass.
7.44.340	The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost.
7.44.341	The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter, which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter.
7.44.342	During the growing season, the ground of the Arctic tundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens.
7.44.343	Low-growing plants such as shrub willow dominate the tundra landscape, shown here in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
7.44.344	Aquatic Biomes
7.44.345	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the effects of abiotic factors on the composition of plant and animal communities in aquatic biomes Compare and contrast the characteristics of the ocean zones Summarize the characteristics of standing water and flowing water freshwater biomes Abiotic Factors Influencing Aquatic Biomes
7.44.346	Like terrestrial biomes, aquatic biomes are influenced by a series of abiotic factors.
7.44.347	The aquatic medium—water— has different physical and chemical properties than air, however.
7.44.348	Even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly clear (there are no suspended particles), water, on its own, absorbs light.
7.44.349	As one descends into a deep body of water, there will eventually be a depth which the sunlight cannot reach.
7.44.350	While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a terrestrial ecosystem that might obscure light (like fog, dust, or insect swarms), usually these are not permanent features of the environment.
7.44.351	The importance of light in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both freshwater and marine ecosystems.
7.44.352	In freshwater systems, stratification due to differences in density is perhaps the most critical abiotic factor and is related to the energy aspects of light.
7.44.353	The thermal properties of water (rates of heating and cooling) are significant to the function of marine systems and have major impacts on global climate and weather patterns.
7.44.354	Marine systems are also influenced by large-scale physical water movements, such as currents; these are less important in most freshwater lakes.
7.44.355	The ocean is categorized by several areas or zones (Figure 44.21).
7.44.356	All of the ocean’s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm (or zone).
7.44.357	The benthic realm (or zone) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor.
7.44.358	Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone, which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate (approximately 200 m or 650 ft).
7.44.359	At depths greater than 200 m, light cannot penetrate; thus, this is referred to as the aphotic zone.
7.44.360	The majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis.
7.44.361	The deepest part of the ocean, the Challenger Deep (in the Mariana Trench, located in the western Pacific Ocean), is about 11,000 m (about 6.8 mi) deep.
7.44.362	To give some perspective on the depth of this trench, the ocean is, on average, 4267 m or 14,000 ft deep.
7.44.363	These realms and zones are relevant to freshwater lakes as well.
7.44.364	Marine Biomes
7.44.365	The ocean is the largest marine biome.
7.44.366	It is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform in chemical composition; it is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter.
7.44.367	Within the ocean, coral reefs are a second kind of marine biome.
7.44.368	Estuaries, coastal areas where salt water and fresh water mix, form a third unique marine biome.
7.44.369	Ocean
7.44.370	The physical diversity of the ocean is a significant influence on plants, animals, and other organisms.
7.44.371	The ocean is categorized into different zones based on how far light reaches into the water.
7.44.372	Each zone has a distinct group of species adapted to the biotic and abiotic conditions particular to that zone.
7.44.373	The intertidal zone, which is the zone between high and low tide, is the oceanic region that is closest to land (Figure 44.21).
7.44.374	Generally, most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach.
7.44.375	In some cases, the intertidal zone is indeed a sandy beach, but it can also be rocky or muddy.
7.44.376	The intertidal zone is an extremely variable environment because of tides.
7.44.377	Organisms are exposed to air and sunlight at low tide and are underwater most of the time, especially during high tide.
7.44.378	Therefore, living things that thrive in the intertidal zone are adapted to being dry for long periods of time.
7.44.379	The shore of the intertidal zone is also repeatedly struck by waves, and the organisms found there are adapted to withstand damage from the pounding action of the waves (Figure 44.22).
7.44.380	The exoskeletons of shoreline crustaceans (such as the shore crab, Carcinus maenas) are tough and protect them from desiccation (drying out) and wave damage.
7.44.381	Another consequence of the pounding waves is that few algae and plants establish themselves in the constantly moving rocks, sand, or mud.
7.44.382	Sea urchins, mussel shells, and starfish are often found in the intertidal zone, shown here in Kachemak Bay, Alaska.
7.44.383	The neritic zone (Figure 44.21) extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m (or 650 ft) at the edge of the continental shelf.
7.44.384	Since light can penetrate this depth, photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone.
7.44.385	The water here contains silt and is well-oxygenated, low in pressure, and stable in temperature.
7.44.386	Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum (a type of free-floating marine seaweed) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone.
7.44.387	Zooplankton, protists, small fishes, and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world’s fisheries.
7.44.388	Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone (Figure 44.21).
7.44.389	Within the oceanic zone there is thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents.
7.44.390	Abundant plankton serve as the base of the food chain for larger animals such as whales and dolphins.
7.44.391	Nutrients are scarce and this is a relatively less productive part of the marine biome.
7.44.392	When photosynthetic organisms and the protists and animals that feed on them die, their bodies fall to the bottom of the ocean where they remain; unlike freshwater lakes, the open ocean lacks a process for bringing the organic nutrients back up to the surface.
7.44.393	The majority of organisms in the aphotic zone include sea cucumbers (phylum Echinodermata) and other organisms that survive on the nutrients contained in the dead bodies of organisms in the photic zone.
7.44.394	Beneath the pelagic zone is the benthic realm, the deepwater region beyond the continental shelf (Figure 44.21).
7.44.395	The bottom of the benthic realm is comprised of sand, silt, and dead organisms.
7.44.396	Temperature decreases, remaining above freezing, as water depth increases.
7.44.397	This is a nutrient-rich portion of the ocean because of the dead organisms that fall from the upper layers of the ocean.
7.44.398	Because of this high level of nutrients, a diversity of fungi, sponges, sea anemones, marine worms, sea stars, fishes, and bacteria exist.
7.44.399	The deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone, which is at depths of 4000 m or greater.
7.44.400	The abyssal zone (Figure 44.21) is very cold and has very high pressure, high oxygen content, and low nutrient content.
7.44.401	There are a variety of invertebrates and fishes found in this zone, but the abyssal zone does not have plants because of the lack of light.
7.44.402	Hydrothermal vents are found primarily in the abyssal zone; chemosynthetic bacteria utilize the hydrogen sulfide and other minerals emitted from the vents.
7.44.403	These chemosynthetic bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide as an energy source and serve as the base of the food chain found in the abyssal zone.
7.44.404	Coral Reefs Coral reefs are ocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates living in warm shallow waters within the photic zone of the ocean.
7.44.405	They are found within 30˚ north and south of the equator.
7.44.406	The Great Barrier Reef is a well-known reef system located several miles off the northeastern coast of Australia.
7.44.407	Other coral reef systems are fringing islands, which are directly adjacent to land, or atolls, which are circular reef systems surrounding a former landmass that is now underwater.
7.44.408	The coral organisms (members of phylum Cnidaria) are colonies of saltwater polyps that secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton.
7.44.409	These calcium-rich skeletons slowly accumulate, forming the underwater reef (Figure 44.23).
7.44.410	Corals found in shallower waters (at a depth of approximately 60 m or about 200 ft) have a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic unicellular algae.
7.44.411	The relationship provides corals with the majority of the nutrition and the energy they require.
7.44.412	The waters in which these corals live are nutritionally poor and, without this mutualism, it would not be possible for large corals to grow.
7.44.413	Some corals living in deeper and colder water do not have a mutualistic relationship with algae; these corals attain energy and nutrients using stinging cells on their tentacles to capture prey.
7.44.414	It is estimated that more than 4,000 fish species inhabit coral reefs.
7.44.415	These fishes can feed on coral, the cryptofauna (invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs), or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral.
7.44.416	In addition, some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef; these species include predators, herbivores, or planktivores.
7.44.417	Predators are animal species that hunt and are carnivores or “flesh eaters.
7.44.418	”
7.44.419	Herbivores eat plant material, and planktivores eat plankton.
7.44.420	Coral reefs are formed by the calcium carbonate skeletons of coral organisms, which are marine invertebrates in the phylum Cnidaria.
7.44.421	Estuaries: Where the Ocean Meets Fresh Water Estuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water, such as a river, meets the ocean.
7.44.422	Therefore, both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity; mixing results in a diluted (brackish) saltwater.
7.44.423	Estuaries form protected areas where many of the young offspring of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish begin their lives.
7.44.424	Salinity is a very important factor that influences the organisms and the adaptations of the organisms found in estuaries.
7.44.425	The salinity of estuaries varies and is based on the rate of flow of its freshwater sources.
7.44.426	Once or twice a day, high tides bring salt water into the estuary.
7.44.427	Low tides occurring at the same frequency reverse the current of salt water.
7.44.428	The short-term and rapid variation in salinity due to the mixing of fresh water and salt water is a difficult physiological challenge for the plants and animals that inhabit estuaries.
7.44.429	Many estuarine plant species are halophytes: plants that can tolerate salty conditions.
7.44.430	Halophytic plants are adapted to deal with the salinity resulting from saltwater on their roots or from sea spray.
7.44.431	In some halophytes, filters in the roots remove the salt from the water that the plant absorbs.
7.44.432	Other plants are able to pump oxygen into their roots.
7.44.433	Animals, such as mussels and clams (phylum Mollusca), have developed behavioral adaptations that expend a lot of energy to function in this rapidly changing environment.
7.44.434	When these animals are exposed to low salinity, they stop feeding, close their shells, and switch from aerobic respiration (in which they use gills) to anaerobic respiration (a process that does not require oxygen).
7.44.435	When high tide returns to the estuary, the salinity and oxygen content of the water increases, and these animals open their shells, begin feeding, and return to aerobic respiration.
7.44.436	Freshwater Biomes Freshwater biomes include lakes and ponds (standing water) as well as rivers and streams (flowing water).
7.44.437	They also include wetlands, which will be discussed later.
7.44.438	Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water, crop irrigation, sanitation, and industry.
7.44.439	These various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services.
7.44.440	Lakes and ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are, therefore, connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these terrestrial biomes.
7.44.441	Lakes and Ponds Lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers.
7.44.442	Temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds.
7.44.443	In the summer, thermal stratification of lakes and ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water.
7.44.444	Light can penetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond.
7.44.445	Phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out photosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds.
7.44.446	Zooplankton, such as rotifers and small crustaceans, consume these phytoplankton.
7.44.447	At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms that sink to the bottom.
7.44.448	Nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds.
7.44.449	Because of this, they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds.
7.44.450	When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus (from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom.
7.44.451	Algal blooms (Figure 44.24) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water.
7.44.452	As a result, the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive.
7.44.453	When the algae die and decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs.
7.44.454	Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to die, and resulting dead zones are found across the globe.
7.44.455	Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.
7.44.456	The uncontrolled growth of algae in this lake has resulted in an algal bloom.
7.44.457	Rivers and Streams Rivers and streams are continuously moving bodies of water that carry large amounts of water from the source, or headwater, to a lake or ocean.
7.44.458	The largest rivers include the Nile River in Africa, the Amazon River in South America, and the Mississippi River in North America.
7.44.459	Abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream.
7.44.460	Streams begin at a point of origin referred to as source water.
7.44.461	The source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and clear.
7.44.462	The channel (the width of the river or stream) is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream.
7.44.463	Because of this, the current is often faster here than at any other point of the river or stream.
7.44.464	The fast-moving water results in minimal silt accumulation at the bottom of the river or stream; therefore, the water is clear.
7.44.465	Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks; the swift current inhibits the growth of phytoplankton.
7.44.466	An additional input of energy can come from leaves or other organic material that falls into the river or stream from trees and other plants that border the water.
7.44.467	When the leaves decompose, the organic material and nutrients in the leaves are returned to the water.
7.44.468	Plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving water.
7.44.469	For instance, leeches (phylum Annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on both ends.
7.44.470	These suckers attach to the substrate, keeping the leech anchored in place.
7.44.471	Freshwater trout species (phylum Chordata) are an important predator in these fast-moving rivers and streams.
7.44.472	As the river or stream flows away from the source, the width of the channel gradually widens and the current slows.
7.44.473	This slow-moving water, caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as tributaries unite, has more sedimentation.
7.44.474	Phytoplankton can also be suspended in slow-moving water.
7.44.475	Therefore, the water will not be as clear as it is near the source.
7.44.476	The water is also warmer.
7.44.477	Worms (phylum Annelida) and insects (phylum Arthropoda) can be found burrowing into the mud.
7.44.478	The higher order predator vertebrates (phylum Chordata) include waterfowl, frogs, and fishes.
7.44.479	These predators must find food in these slow moving, sometimes murky, waters and, unlike the trout in the waters at the source, these vertebrates may not be able to use vision as their primary sense to find food.
7.44.480	Instead, they are more likely to use taste or chemical cues to find prey.
7.44.481	Wetlands Wetlands are environments in which the soil is either permanently or periodically saturated with water.
7.44.482	Wetlands are different from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth.
7.44.483	Emergent vegetation consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves, stems, and flowers extending above the water’s surface.
7.44.484	There are several types of wetlands including marshes, swamps, bogs, mudflats, and salt marshes (Figure 44.25).
7.44.485	The three shared characteristics among these types—what makes them wetlands—are their hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydric soils.
7.44.486	Located in southern Florida, Everglades National Park is vast array of wetland environments, including sawgrass marshes, cypress swamps, and estuarine mangrove forests.
7.44.487	Here, a great egret walks among cypress trees.
7.44.488	Freshwater marshes and swamps are characterized by slow and steady water flow.
7.44.489	Bogs develop in depressions where water flow is low or nonexistent.
7.44.490	Bogs usually occur in areas where there is a clay bottom with poor percolation.
7.44.491	Percolation is the movement of water through the pores in the soil or rocks.
7.44.492	The water found in a bog is stagnant and oxygen depleted because the oxygen that is used during the decomposition of organic matter is not replaced.
7.44.493	As the oxygen in the water is depleted, decomposition slows.
7.44.494	This leads to organic acids and other acids building up and lowering the pH of the water.
7.44.495	At a lower pH, nitrogen becomes unavailable to plants.
7.44.496	This creates a challenge for plants because nitrogen is an important limiting resource.
7.44.497	Some types of bog plants (such as sundews, pitcher plants, and Venus flytraps) capture insects and extract the nitrogen from their bodies.
7.44.498	Bogs have low net primary productivity because the water found in bogs has low levels of nitrogen and oxygen.
7.44.499	Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change
7.44.500	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define global climate change Summarize the effects of the Industrial Revolution on global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration
7.44.501	Describe three natural factors affecting long-term global climate List two or more greenhouse gases and describe their role in the greenhouse effect
7.44.502	All biomes are universally affected by global conditions, such as climate, that ultimately shape each biome’s environment.
7.44.503	Scientists who study climate have noted a series of marked changes that have gradually become increasingly evident during the last sixty years.
7.44.504	Global climate change is the term used to describe altered global weather patterns, including a worldwide increase in temperature, due largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
7.44.505	Climate and Weather A common misconception about global climate change is that a specific weather event occurring in a particular region (for example, a very cool week in June in central Indiana) is evidence of global climate change.
7.44.506	However, a cold week in June is a weather-related event and not a climate-related one.
7.44.507	These misconceptions often arise because of confusion over the terms climate and weather.
7.44.508	Climate refers to the long-term, predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area.
7.44.509	The climate of a biome is characterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges.
7.44.510	Climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one particular day in a biome or the colder-than-average temperatures that occurred on one day.
7.44.511	In contrast, weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time.
7.44.512	Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles.
7.44.513	Long-range weather forecasts are available but can be unreliable.
7.44.514	To better understand the difference between climate and weather, imagine that you are planning an outdoor event in northern Wisconsin.
7.44.515	You would be thinking about climate when you plan the event in the summer rather than the winter because you have long-term knowledge that any given Saturday in the months of May to August would be a better choice for an outdoor event in Wisconsin than any given Saturday in January.
7.44.516	However, you cannot determine the specific day that the event should be held on because it is difficult to accurately predict the weather on a specific day.
7.44.517	Climate can be considered “average” weather.
7.44.518	Global Climate Change Climate change can be understood by approaching three areas of study: • current and past global climate change • causes of past and present-day global climate change • ancient and current results of climate change
7.44.519	It is helpful to keep these three different aspects of climate change clearly separated when consuming media reports about global climate change.
7.44.520	It is common for reports and discussions about global climate change to confuse the data showing that Earth’s climate is changing with the factors that drive this climate change.
7.44.521	Evidence for Global Climate Change
7.44.522	Since scientists cannot go back in time to directly measure climatic variables, such as average temperature and precipitation, they must instead indirectly measure temperature.
7.44.523	To do this, scientists rely on historical evidence of Earth’s past climate.
7.44.524	Antarctic ice cores are a key example of such evidence.
7.44.525	These ice cores are samples of polar ice obtained by means of drills that reach thousands of meters into ice sheets or high mountain glaciers.
7.44.526	Viewing the ice cores is like traveling backwards through time; the deeper the sample, the earlier the time period.
7.44.527	Trapped within the ice are bubbles of air and other biological evidence that can reveal temperature and carbon dioxide data.
7.44.528	Antarctic ice cores have been collected and analyzed to indirectly estimate the temperature of the Earth over the past 400,000 years (Figure 44.26a).
7.44.529	The 0 °C on this graph refers to the long-term average.
7.44.530	Temperatures that are greater than 0 °C exceed Earth’s long-term average temperature.
7.44.531	Conversely, temperatures that are less than 0 °C are less than Earth’s average temperature.
7.44.532	This figure shows that there have been periodic cycles of increasing and decreasing temperature.
7.44.533	Before the late 1800s, the Earth has been as much as 9 °C cooler and about 3 °C warmer.
7.44.534	Note that the graph in Figure 44.26b shows that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has also risen and fallen in periodic cycles; note the relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and temperature.
7.44.535	Figure 44.26b shows that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have historically cycled between 180 and 300 parts per million (ppm) by volume.
7.44.536	Ice at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica was laid down over the course 420,000 years and reached a depth of over 3,000 m. By measuring the amount of CO2 trapped in the ice, scientists have determined past atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
7.44.537	Temperatures relative to modern day were determined from the amount of deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen) present.
7.44.538	Figure 44.26a does not show the last 2,000 years with enough detail to compare the changes of Earth’s temperature during the last 400,000 years with the temperature change that has occurred in the more recent past.
7.44.539	Two significant temperature anomalies, or irregularities, have occurred in the last 2000 years.
7.44.540	These are the Medieval Climate Anomaly (or the Medieval Warm Period) and the Little Ice Age.
7.44.541	A third temperature anomaly aligns with the Industrial Era.
7.44.542	The Medieval Climate Anomaly occurred between 900 and 1300 AD.
7.44.543	During this time period, many climate scientists think that slightly warmer weather conditions prevailed in many parts of the world; the higher-than-average temperature changes varied between 0.10 °C and 0.20 °C above the norm.
7.44.544	Although 0.10 °C does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change, it did free seas of ice.
7.44.545	Because of this warming, the Vikings were able to colonize Greenland.
7.44.546	The Little Ice Age was a cold period that occurred between 1550 AD and 1850 AD.
7.44.547	During this time, a slight cooling of a little less than 1 °C was observed in North America, Europe, and possibly other areas of the Earth.
7.44.548	This 1 °C change in global temperature is a seemingly small deviation in temperature (as was observed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly); however, it also resulted in noticeable changes.
7.44.549	Historical accounts reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much snow and frost.
7.44.550	The Industrial Revolution, which began around 1750, was characterized by changes in much of human society.
7.44.551	Advances in agriculture increased the food supply, which improved the standard of living for people in Europe and the United States.
7.44.552	New technologies were invented and provided jobs and cheaper goods.
7.44.553	These new technologies were powered using fossil fuels, especially coal.
7.44.554	The Industrial Revolution starting in the early nineteenth century ushered in the beginning of the Industrial Era.
7.44.555	When a fossil fuel is burned, carbon dioxide is released.
7.44.556	With the beginning of the Industrial Era, atmospheric carbon dioxide began to rise.
7.44.557	The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has risen steadily since the beginning of industrialization.
7.44.558	Current and Past Drivers of Global Climate Change
7.44.559	Since it is not possible to go back in time to directly observe and measure climate, scientists use indirect evidence to determine the drivers, or factors, that may be responsible for climate change.
7.44.560	The indirect evidence includes data collected using ice cores, boreholes (a narrow shaft bored into the ground), tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean sediments.
7.44.561	The data shows a correlation between the timing of temperature changes and drivers of climate change: before the Industrial Era (pre-1780), there were three drivers of climate change that were not related to human activity or atmospheric gases.
7.44.562	The first of these is the Milankovitch cycles.
7.44.563	The Milankovitch cycles describe the effects of slight changes in the Earth’s orbit on Earth’s climate.
7.44.564	The length of the Milankovitch cycles ranges between 19,000 and 100,000 years.
7.44.565	In other words, one could expect to see some predictable changes in the Earth’s climate associated with changes in the Earth’s orbit at a minimum of every 19,000 years.
7.44.566	The variation in the sun’s intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change.
7.44.567	Solar intensity is the amount of solar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time.
7.44.568	There is a direct relationship between solar intensity and temperature.
7.44.569	As solar intensity increases (or decreases), the Earth’s temperature correspondingly increases (or decreases).
7.44.570	Changes in solar intensity have been proposed as one of several possible explanations for the Little Ice Age.
7.44.571	Finally, volcanic eruptions are a third natural driver of climate change.
7.44.572	Volcanic eruptions can last a few days, but the solids and gases released during an eruption can influence the climate over a period of a few years, causing short-term climate changes.
7.44.573	The gases and solids released by volcanic eruptions can include carbon dioxide, water vapor, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide.
7.44.574	Generally, volcanic eruptions cool the climate.
7.44.575	This occurred in 1783 when volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide.
7.44.576	This led to haze-effect cooling, a global phenomenon that occurs when dust, ash, or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result; haze-effect cooling usually extends for one or more years.
7.44.577	In Europe and North America, hazeeffect cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784.
7.44.578	Greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate.
7.44.579	When heat energy from the sun strikes the Earth, gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere, as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from escaping.
7.44.580	The greenhouse gases that affect Earth include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, nitrous oxide, and ozone.
7.44.581	Approximately half of the radiation from the sun passes through these gases in the atmosphere and strikes the Earth.
7.44.582	This radiation is converted into thermal radiation on the Earth’s surface, and then a portion of that energy is re-radiated back into the atmosphere.
7.44.583	Greenhouse gases, however, reflect much of the thermal energy back to the Earth’s surface.
7.44.584	The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earth’s surface.
7.44.585	Greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect: the warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
7.44.586	Evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature: as carbon dioxide rises, global temperature rises.
7.44.587	Since 1950, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006.
7.44.588	In 2011, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was 392 ppm.
7.44.589	However, the planet would not be inhabitable by current life forms if water vapor did not produce its drastic greenhouse warming effect.
7.44.590	Scientists look at patterns in data and try to explain differences or deviations from these patterns.
7.44.591	The atmospheric carbon dioxide data reveal a historical pattern of carbon dioxide increasing and decreasing, cycling between a low of 180 ppm and a high of 300 ppm.
7.44.592	Scientists have concluded that it took around 50,000 years for the atmospheric carbon dioxide level to increase from its low minimum concentration to its higher maximum concentration.
7.44.593	However, starting recently, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased beyond the historical maximum of 300 ppm.
7.44.594	The current increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide have happened very quickly—in a matter of hundreds of years rather than thousands of years.
7.44.595	What is the reason for this difference in the rate of change and the amount of increase in carbon dioxide?
7.44.596	A key factor that must be recognized when comparing the historical data and the current data is the presence of modern human society; no other driver of climate change has yielded changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at this rate or to this magnitude.
7.44.597	Human activity releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the most important greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere in several ways.
7.44.598	The primary mechanism that releases carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, coal, and natural gas (Figure 44.28).
7.44.599	Deforestation, cement manufacture, animal agriculture, the clearing of land, and the burning of forests are other human activities that release carbon dioxide.
7.44.600	Methane (CH4) is produced when bacteria break down organic matter under anaerobic conditions.
7.44.601	Anaerobic conditions can happen when organic matter is trapped underwater (such as in rice paddies) or in the intestines of herbivores.
7.44.602	Methane can also be released from natural gas fields and the decomposition that occurs in landfills.
7.44.603	Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates.
7.44.604	Clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean.
7.44.605	When water warms, these chunks of ice melt and methane is released.
7.44.606	As the ocean’s water temperature increases, the rate at which clathrates melt is increasing, releasing even more methane.
7.44.607	This leads to increased levels of methane in the atmosphere, which further accelerates the rate of global warming.
7.44.608	This is an example of the positive feedback loop that is leading to the rapid rate of increase of global temperatures.
7.44.609	The burning of fossil fuels in industry and by vehicles releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
7.44.610	Documented Results of Climate Change:
7.44.611	Past and Present Scientists have geological evidence of the consequences of long-ago climate change.
7.44.612	Modern-day phenomena such as retreating glaciers and melting polar ice cause a continual rise in sea level.
7.44.613	Meanwhile, changes in climate can negatively affect organisms.
7.44.614	Geological Climate Change Global warming has been associated with at least one planet-wide extinction event during the geological past.
7.44.615	The Permian extinction event occurred about 251 million years ago toward the end of the roughly 50-million-year-long geological time span known as the Permian period.
7.44.616	This geologic time period was one of the three warmest periods in Earth’s geologic history.
7.44.617	Scientists estimate that approximately 70 percent of the terrestrial plant and animal species and 84 percent of marine species became extinct, vanishing forever near the end of the Permian period.
7.44.618	Organisms that had adapted to wet and warm climatic conditions, such as annual rainfall of 300–400 cm (118–157 in) and 20 °C–30 °C (68 °F–86 °F) in the tropical wet forest, may not have been able to survive the Permian climate change.
7.44.619	Present Climate Change
7.44.620	A number of global events have occurred that may be attributed to climate change during our lifetimes.
7.44.621	Glacier National Park in Montana is undergoing the retreat of many of its glaciers, a phenomenon known as glacier recession.
7.44.622	In 1850, the area contained approximately 150 glaciers.
7.44.623	By 2010, however, the park contained only about 24 glaciers greater than 25 acres in size.
7.44.624	One of these glaciers is the Grinnell Glacier (Figure 44.29) at Mount Gould.
7.44.625	Between 1966 and 2005, the size of Grinnell Glacier shrank by 40 percent.
7.44.626	Similarly, the mass of the ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic is decreasing: Greenland lost 150–250 km3 of ice per year between 2002 and 2006.
7.44.627	In addition, the size and thickness of the Arctic sea ice is decreasing.
7.44.628	The effect of global warming can be seen in the continuing retreat of Grinnel Glacier.
7.44.629	The mean annual temperature in the park has increased 1.33 °C since 1900.
7.44.630	The loss of a glacier results in the loss of summer meltwaters, sharply reducing seasonal water supplies and severely affecting local ecosystems.
7.44.631	This loss of ice is leading to increases in the global sea level.
7.44.632	On average, the sea is rising at a rate of 1.8 mm per year.
7.44.633	However, between 1993 and 2010 the rate of sea level increase ranged between 2.9 and 3.4 mm per year.
7.44.634	A variety of factors affect the volume of water in the ocean, including the temperature of the water (the density of water is related to its temperature) and the amount of water found in rivers, lakes, glaciers, polar ice caps, and sea ice.
7.44.635	As glaciers and polar ice caps melt, there is a significant contribution of liquid water that was previously frozen.
7.44.636	In addition to some abiotic conditions changing in response to climate change, many organisms are also being affected by the changes in temperature.
7.44.637	Temperature and precipitation play key roles in determining the geographic distribution and phenology of plants and animals.
7.44.638	(Phenology is the study of the effects of climatic conditions on the timing of periodic lifecycle events, such as flowering in plants or migration in birds.)
7.44.639	Researchers have shown that 385 plant species in Great Britain are flowering 4.5 days sooner than was recorded earlier during the previous 40 years.
7.44.640	In addition, insect-pollinated species were more likely to flower earlier than wind-pollinated species.
7.44.641	The impact of changes in flowering date would be mitigated if the insect pollinators emerged earlier.
7.44.642	This mismatched timing of plants and pollinators could result in injurious ecosystem effects because, for continued survival, insect-pollinated plants must flower when their pollinators are present.
7.45.0	Asian carp jump out of the water in response to electrofishing.
7.45.1	The Asian carp in the inset photograph were harvested from the Little Calumet River in Illinois in May, 2010, using rotenone, a toxin often used as an insecticide, in an effort to learn more about the population of the species.
7.45.2	Imagine sailing down a river in a small motorboat on a weekend afternoon; the water is smooth and you are enjoying the warm sunshine and cool breeze when suddenly you are hit in the head by a 20-pound silver carp.
7.45.3	This is a risk now on many rivers and canal systems in Illinois and Missouri because of the presence of Asian carp.
7.45.4	This fish—actually a group of species including the silver, black, grass, and big head carp—has been farmed and eaten in China for over 1000 years.
7.45.5	It is one of the most important aquaculture food resources worldwide.
7.45.6	In the United States, however, Asian carp is considered a dangerous invasive species that disrupts community structure and composition to the point of threatening native species.
7.45.7	Population Demography
7.45.8	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe how ecologists measure population size and density Describe three different patterns of population distribution
7.45.9	Use life tables to calculate mortality rates Describe the three types of survivorship curves and relate them to specific populations Populations are dynamic entities.
7.45.10	Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area, and populations fluctuate based on a number of factors: seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within species.
7.45.11	The statistical study of population dynamics, demography, uses a series of mathematical tools to investigate how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments.
7.45.12	Many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations.
7.45.13	For example, life tables, which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates.
7.45.14	In fact, while the term “demographics” is commonly used when discussing humans, all living populations can be studied using this approach.
7.45.15	Population Size and Density
7.45.16	The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist, and how closely associated they are with each other.
7.45.17	Within a particular habitat, a population can be characterized by its population size (N), the total number of individuals, and its population density, the number of individuals within a specific area or volume.
7.45.18	Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations.
7.45.19	For example, populations with more individuals may be more stable than smaller populations based on their genetic variability, and thus their potential to adapt to the environment.
7.45.20	Alternatively, a member of a population with low population density (more spread out in the habitat), might have more difficulty finding a mate to reproduce compared to a population of higher density.
7.45.21	As is shown in Figure 45.2, smaller organisms tend to be more densely distributed than larger organisms.
7.45.22	Population Research Methods
7.45.23	The most accurate way to determine population size is to simply count all of the individuals within the habitat.
7.45.24	However, this method is often not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large habitats.
7.45.25	Thus, scientists usually study populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this data to make inferences about the habitat as a whole.
7.45.26	A variety of methods can be used to sample populations to determine their size and density.
7.45.27	For immobile organisms such as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, a quadrat may be used (Figure 45.3).
7.45.28	A quadrat is a way of marking off square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use of a wood, plastic, or metal square placed on the ground.
7.45.29	After setting the quadrats, researchers then count the number of individuals that lie within their boundaries.
7.45.30	Multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several random locations.
7.45.31	All of this data can then be used to estimate the population size and population density within the entire habitat.
7.45.32	The number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of organisms under study and other factors, including the density of the organism.
7.45.33	For example, if sampling daffodils, a 1 m2 quadrat might be used whereas with giant redwoods, which are larger and live much further apart from each other, a larger quadrat of 100 m2 might be employed.
7.45.34	This ensures that enough individuals of the species are counted to get an accurate sample that correlates with the habitat, including areas not sampled.
7.45.35	A scientist uses a quadrat to measure population size and density.
7.45.36	For mobile organisms, such as mammals, birds, or fish, a technique called mark and recapture is often used.
7.45.37	This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way (such as tags, bands, paint, or other body markings), and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population; later, a new sample is collected, including some individuals that are marked (recaptures) and some individuals that are unmarked.
7.45.38	Mark and recapture is used to measure the population size of mobile animals such as (a) bighorn sheep, (b) the California condor, and (c) salmon.
7.45.39	Using the ratio of marked and unmarked individuals, scientists determine how many individuals are in the sample.
7.45.40	From this, calculations are used to estimate the total population size.
7.45.41	This method assumes that the larger the population, the lower the percentage of tagged organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with more untagged individuals.
7.45.42	For example, if 80 deer are captured, tagged, and released into the forest, and later 100 deer are captured and 20 of them are already marked, we can determine the population size (N) using the following equation: Therefore, there are an estimated 400 total individuals in the original population.
7.45.43	There are some limitations to the mark and recapture method.
7.45.44	Some animals from the first catch may learn to avoid capture in the second round, thus inflating population estimates.
7.45.45	Alternatively, animals may preferentially be retrapped (especially if a food reward is offered), resulting in an underestimate of population size.
7.45.46	Also, some species may be harmed by the marking technique, reducing their survival.
7.45.47	A variety of other techniques have been developed, including the electronic tracking of animals tagged with radio transmitters and the use of data from commercial fishing and trapping operations to estimate the size and health of populations and communities.
7.45.48	Species Distribution
7.45.49	In addition to measuring simple density, further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals.
7.45.50	Species dispersion patterns (or distribution patterns) show the spatial relationship between members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time.
7.45.51	In other words, they show whether members of the species live close together or far apart, and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart.
7.45.52	Individuals in a population can be more or less equally spaced apart, dispersed randomly with no predictable pattern, or clustered in groups.
7.45.53	These are known as uniform, random, and clumped dispersion patterns, respectively (Figure 45.5).
7.45.54	Uniform dispersion is observed in plants that secrete substances inhibiting the growth of nearby individuals (such as the release of toxic chemicals by the sage plant Salvia leucophylla, a phenomenon called allelopathy) and in animals like the penguin that maintain a defined territory.
7.45.55	An example of random dispersion occurs with dandelion and other plants that have wind-dispersed seeds that germinate wherever they happen to fall in a favorable environment.
7.45.56	A clumped dispersion may be seen in plants that drop their seeds straight to the ground, such as oak trees, or animals that live in groups (schools of fish or herds of elephants).
7.45.57	Clumped dispersions may also be a function of habitat heterogeneity.
7.45.58	Thus, the dispersion of the individuals within a population provides more information about how they interact with each other than does a simple density measurement.
7.45.59	Just as lower density species might have more difficulty finding a mate, solitary species with a random distribution might have a similar difficulty when compared to social species clumped together in groups.
7.45.60	Species may have uniform, random, or clumped distribution.
7.45.61	Territorial birds such as penguins tend to have uniform distribution.
7.45.62	Plants such as dandelions with wind-dispersed seeds tend to be randomly distributed.
7.45.63	Animals such as elephants that travel in groups exhibit clumped distribution.
7.45.64	Demography
7.45.65	While population size and density describe a population at one particular point in time, scientists must use demography to study the dynamics of a population.
7.45.66	Demography is the statistical study of population changes over time: birth rates, death rates, and life expectancies.
7.45.67	Each of these measures, especially birth rates, may be affected by the population characteristics described above.
7.45.68	For example, a large population size results in a higher birth rate because more potentially reproductive individuals are present.
7.45.69	In contrast, a large population size can also result in a higher death rate because of competition, disease, and the accumulation of waste.
7.45.70	Similarly, a higher population density or a clumped dispersion pattern results in more potential reproductive encounters between individuals, which can increase birth rate.
7.45.71	Lastly, a female-biased sex ratio (the ratio of males to females) or age structure (the proportion of population members at specific age ranges) composed of many individuals of reproductive age can increase birth rates.
7.45.72	In addition, the demographic characteristics of a population can influence how the population grows or declines over time.
7.45.73	If birth and death rates are equal, the population remains stable.
7.45.74	However, the population size will increase if birth rates exceed death rates; the population will decrease if birth rates are less than death rates.
7.45.75	Life expectancy is another important factor; the length of time individuals remain in the population impacts local resources, reproduction, and the overall health of the population.
7.45.76	These demographic characteristics are often displayed in the form of a life table.
7.45.77	Life Tables Life tables provide important information about the life history of an organism.
7.45.78	Life tables divide the population into age groups and often sexes, and show how long a member of that group is likely to live.
7.45.79	They are modeled after actuarial tables used by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy.
7.45.80	Life tables may include the probability of individuals dying before their next birthday (i.e., their mortality rate), the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval, and their life expectancy at each interval.
7.45.81	An example of a life table is shown in Table 45.1 from a study of Dall mountain sheep, a species native to northwestern North America.
7.45.82	Notice that the population is divided into age intervals (column A).
7.45.83	The mortality rate (per 1000), shown in column D, is based on the number of individuals dying during the age interval (column B) divided by the number of individuals surviving at the beginning of the interval (Column C), multiplied by 1000.
7.45.84	For example, between ages three and four, 12 individuals die out of the 776 that were remaining from the original 1000 sheep.
7.45.85	This number is then multiplied by 1000 to get the mortality rate per thousand.
7.45.86	As can be seen from the mortality rate data (column D), a high death rate occurred when the sheep were between 6 and 12 months old, and then increased even more from 8 to 12 years old, after which there were few survivors.
7.45.87	The data indicate that if a sheep in this population were to survive to age one, it could be expected to live another 7.7 years on average, as shown by the life expectancy numbers in column E. Survivorship Curves
7.45.88	Another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve, which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time (usually with data compiled from a life table).
7.45.89	These curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations (Figure 45.6).
7.45.90	Humans and most primates exhibit a Type I survivorship curve because a high percentage of offspring survive their early and middle years—death occurs predominantly in older individuals.
7.45.91	These types of species usually have small numbers of offspring at one time, and they give a high amount of parental care to them to ensure their survival.
7.45.92	Birds are an example of an intermediate or Type II survivorship curve because birds die more or less equally at each age interval.
7.45.93	These organisms also may have relatively few offspring and provide significant parental care.
7.45.94	Trees, marine invertebrates, and most fishes exhibit a Type III survivorship curve because very few of these organisms survive their younger years; however, those that make it to an old age are more likely to survive for a relatively long period of time.
7.45.95	Organisms in this category usually have a very large number of offspring, but once they are born, little parental care is provided.
7.45.96	Thus these offspring are “on their own” and vulnerable to predation, but their sheer numbers assure the survival of enough individuals to perpetuate the species.
7.45.97	Survivorship curves show the distribution of individuals in a population according to age.
7.45.98	Humans and most mammals have a Type I survivorship curve because death primarily occurs in the older years.
7.45.99	Birds have a Type II survivorship curve, as death at any age is equally probable.
7.45.100	Trees have a Type III survivorship curve because very few survive the younger years, but after a certain age, individuals are much more likely to survive.
7.45.101	45.2 | Life Histories and Natural Selection
7.45.102	By the end of this section, you will be able to:
7.45.103	• Describe how life history patterns are influenced by natural selection •
7.45.104	Explain different life history patterns and how different reproductive strategies affect species’ survival
7.45.105	A species’ life history describes the series of events over its lifetime, such as how resources are allocated for growth, maintenance, and reproduction.
7.45.106	Life history traits affect the life table of an organism.
7.45.107	A species’ life history is genetically determined and shaped by the environment and natural selection.
7.45.108	Life History Patterns and Energy Budgets Energy is required by all living organisms for their growth, maintenance, and reproduction; at the same time, energy is often a major limiting factor in determining an organism’s survival.
7.45.109	Plants, for example, acquire energy from the sun via photosynthesis, but must expend this energy to grow, maintain health, and produce energy-rich seeds to produce the next generation.
7.45.110	Animals have the additional burden of using some of their energy reserves to acquire food.
7.45.111	Furthermore, some animals must expend energy caring for their offspring.
7.45.112	Thus, all species have an energy budget: they must balance energy intake with their use of energy for metabolism, reproduction, parental care, and energy storage (such as bears building up body fat for winter hibernation).
7.45.113	Parental Care and Fecundity Fecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population.
7.45.114	In other words, fecundity describes how many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible, repeating the reproductive cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring.
7.45.115	In animals, fecundity is inversely related to the amount of parental care given to an individual offspring.
7.45.116	Species, such as many marine invertebrates, that produce many offspring usually provide little if any care for the offspring (they would not have the energy or the ability to do so anyway).
7.45.117	Most of their energy budget is used to produce many tiny offspring.
7.45.118	Animals with this strategy are often self-sufficient at a very early age.
7.45.119	This is because of the energy tradeoff these organisms have made to maximize their evolutionary fitness.
7.45.120	Because their energy is used for producing offspring instead of parental care, it makes sense that these offspring have some ability to be able to move within their environment and find food and perhaps shelter.
7.45.121	Even with these abilities, their small size makes them extremely vulnerable to predation, so the production of many offspring allows enough of them to survive to maintain the species.
7.45.122	Animal species that have few offspring during a reproductive event usually give extensive parental care, devoting much of their energy budget to these activities, sometimes at the expense of their own health.
7.45.123	This is the case with many mammals, such as humans, kangaroos, and pandas.
7.45.124	The offspring of these species are relatively helpless at birth and need to develop before they achieve self-sufficiency.
7.45.125	Plants with low fecundity produce few energy-rich seeds (such as coconuts and chestnuts) with each having a good chance to germinate into a new organism; plants with high fecundity usually have many small, energy-poor seeds (like orchids) that have a relatively poor chance of surviving.
7.45.126	Although it may seem that coconuts and chestnuts have a better chance of surviving, the energy tradeoff of the orchid is also very effective.
7.45.127	It is a matter of where the energy is used, for large numbers of seeds or for fewer seeds with more energy.
7.45.128	Early versus Late Reproduction
7.45.129	The timing of reproduction in a life history also affects species survival.
7.45.130	Organisms that reproduce at an early age have a greater chance of producing offspring, but this is usually at the expense of their growth and the maintenance of their health.
7.45.131	Conversely, organisms that start reproducing later in life often have greater fecundity or are better able to provide parental care, but they risk that they will not survive to reproductive age.
7.45.132	Examples of this can be seen in fishes.
7.45.133	Small fish like guppies use their energy to reproduce rapidly, but never attain the size that would give them defense against some predators.
7.45.134	Larger fish, like the bluegill or shark, use their energy to attain a large size, but do so with the risk that they will die before they can reproduce or at least reproduce to their maximum.
7.45.135	These different energy strategies and tradeoffs are key to understanding the evolution of each species as it maximizes its fitness and fills its niche.
7.45.136	In terms of energy budgeting, some species “blow it all” and use up most of their energy reserves to reproduce early before they die.
7.45.137	Other species delay having reproduction to become stronger, more experienced individuals and to make sure that they are strong enough to provide parental care if necessary.
7.45.138	Single versus Multiple Reproductive Events
7.45.139	Some life history traits, such as fecundity, timing of reproduction, and parental care, can be grouped together into general strategies that are used by multiple species.
7.45.140	Semelparity occurs when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime and then dies.
7.45.141	Such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event, sacrificing their health to the point that they do not survive.
7.45.142	Examples of semelparity are bamboo, which flowers once and then dies, and the Chinook salmon (Figure 45.7a), which uses most of its energy reserves to migrate from the ocean to its freshwater nesting area, where it reproduces and then dies.
7.45.143	Scientists have posited alternate explanations for the evolutionary advantage of the Chinook’s post-reproduction death:
7.45.144	a programmed suicide caused by a massive release of corticosteroid hormones, presumably so the parents can become food for the offspring, or simple exhaustion caused by the energy demands of reproduction; these are still being debated.
7.45.145	Iteroparity describes species that reproduce repeatedly during their lives.
7.45.146	Some animals are able to mate only once per year, but survive multiple mating seasons.
7.45.147	The pronghorn antelope is an example of an animal that goes into a seasonal estrus cycle (“heat”): a hormonally induced physiological condition preparing the body for successful mating (Figure 45.7b).
7.45.148	Females of these species mate only during the estrus phase of the cycle.
7.45.149	A different pattern is observed in primates, including humans and chimpanzees, which may attempt reproduction at any time during their reproductive years, even though their menstrual cycles make pregnancy likely only a few days per month during ovulation.
7.45.150	The (a) Chinook salmon mates once and dies.
7.45.151	The (b) pronghorn antelope mates during specific times of the year during its reproductive life.
7.45.152	Primates, such as humans and (c) chimpanzees, may mate on any day, independent of ovulation.
7.45.153	45.3 | Environmental Limits to Population Growth
7.45.154	By the end of this section, you will be able to:
7.45.155	•
7.45.156	Explain the characteristics of and differences between exponential and logistic growth patterns • Give examples of exponential and logistic growth in natural populations
7.45.157	• Describe how natural selection and environmental adaptation led to the evolution of particular life history patterns
7.45.158	Although life histories describe the way many characteristics of a population (such as their age structure) change over time in a general way, population ecologists make use of a variety of methods to model population dynamics mathematically.
7.45.159	These more precise models can then be used to accurately describe changes occurring in a population and better predict future changes.
7.45.160	Certain models that have been accepted for decades are now being modified or even abandoned due to their lack of predictive ability, and scholars strive to create effective new models.
7.45.161	Exponential Growth Charles Darwin, in his theory of natural selection, was greatly influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus.
7.45.162	Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted.
7.45.163	This accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called exponential growth.
7.45.164	The best example of exponential growth is seen in bacteria.
7.45.165	Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce by prokaryotic fission.
7.45.166	This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species.
7.45.167	If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an unlimited supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become depleted), after an hour, there is one round of division and each organism divides, resulting in 2000 organisms—an increase of 1000.
7.45.168	In another hour, each of the 2000 organisms will double, producing 4000, an increase of 2000 organisms.
7.45.169	After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask, an increase of 4000 organisms.
7.45.170	The important concept of exponential growth is that the population growth rate—the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation—is accelerating; that is, it is increasing at a greater and greater rate.
7.45.171	After 1 day and 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion.
7.45.172	When the population size, N, is plotted over time, a J-shaped growth curve is produced (Figure 45.9).
7.45.173	The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited.
7.45.174	Furthermore, some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce, lowering the growth rate.
7.45.175	Therefore, when calculating the growth rate of a population, the death rate (D) (number organisms that die during a particular time interval) is subtracted from the birth rate (B) (number organisms that are born during that interval).
7.45.176	This is shown in the following formula: The birth rate is usually expressed on a per capita (for each individual) basis.
7.45.177	Thus, B (birth rate) = bN (the per capita birth rate “b” multiplied by the number of individuals “N”) and D (death rate) =
7.45.178	dN (the per capita death rate “
7.45.179	d” multiplied by the number of individuals “N”).
7.45.180	Additionally, ecologists are interested in the population at a particular point in time, an infinitely small time interval.
7.45.181	For this reason, the terminology of differential calculus is used to obtain the “instantaneous” growth rate, replacing the change in number and time with an instant-specific measurement of number and time.
7.45.182	Notice that the “d” associated with the first term refers to the derivative (as the term is used in calculus) and is different from the death rate, also called
7.45.183	“
7.45.184	d.
7.45.185	”
7.45.186	The difference between birth and death rates is further simplified by substituting the term “r
7.45.187	” (intrinsic rate of increase) for the relationship between birth and death rates: The value “r” can be positive, meaning the population is increasing in size; or negative, meaning the population is decreasing in size; or zero, where the population’s size is unchanging, a condition known as zero population growth.
7.45.188	A further refinement of the formula recognizes that different species have inherent differences in their intrinsic rate of increase (often thought of as the potential for reproduction), even under ideal conditions.
7.45.189	Obviously, a bacterium can reproduce more rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human.
7.45.190	The maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential, or rmax, thus changing the equation to: When resources are unlimited, populations exhibit exponential growth, resulting in a J-shaped curve.
7.45.191	When resources are limited, populations exhibit logistic growth.
7.45.192	In logistic growth, population expansion decreases as resources become scarce, and it levels off when the carrying capacity of the environment is reached, resulting in an S-shaped curve.
7.45.193	Logistic Growth Exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world.
7.45.194	Charles Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the “struggle for existence,” which states that individuals will compete (with members of their own or other species) for limited resources.
7.45.195	The successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate (natural selection).
7.45.196	To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the logistic growth model.
7.45.197	Carrying Capacity and the Logistic Model
7.45.198	In the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely.
7.45.199	Exponential growth may occur in environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large enough, resources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate.
7.45.200	Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (Figure 45.9).
7.45.201	This population size, which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support, is called the carrying capacity, or K.
7.45.202	The formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate.
7.45.203	The expression “K – N” is indicative of how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage, and “K – N” divided by “K” is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth.
7.45.204	Thus, the exponential growth model is restricted by this factor to generate the logistic growth equation:
7.45.205	Notice that when N is very small, (K-N)/K becomes close to K/K or 1, and the right side of the equation reduces to rmaxN, which means the population is growing exponentially and is not influenced by carrying capacity.
7.45.206	On the other hand, when N is large, (K-N)/K come close to zero, which means that population growth will be slowed greatly or even stopped.
7.45.207	Thus, population growth is greatly slowed in large populations by the carrying capacity K. This model also allows for the population of a negative population growth, or a population decline.
7.45.208	This occurs when the number of individuals in the population exceeds the carrying capacity (because the value of (K-N)/K is negative).
7.45.209	A graph of this equation yields an S-shaped curve (Figure 45.9), and it is a more realistic model of population growth than exponential growth.
7.45.210	There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve.
7.45.211	Initially, growth is exponential because there are few individuals and ample resources available.
7.45.212	Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases.
7.45.213	Finally, growth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population size over time.
7.45.214	Role of Intraspecific Competition
7.45.215	The logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal chance for survival.
7.45.216	For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and the space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.
7.45.217	In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others.
7.45.218	The resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed intraspecific competition (intra-
7.45.219	= “within”; -specific =
7.45.220	“species”).
7.45.221	Intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity—resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need.
7.45.222	However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies.
7.45.223	In addition, the accumulation of waste products can reduce an environment’s carrying capacity.
7.45.224	Examples of Logistic Growth Yeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages, exhibits the classical S-shaped curve when grown in a test tube (Figure 45.10a).
7.45.225	Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth.
7.45.226	In the real world, however, there are variations to this idealized curve.
7.45.227	Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (Figure 45.10b).
7.45.228	In both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity afterwards.
7.45.229	This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around its carrying capacity.
7.45.230	Still, even with this oscillation, the logistic model is confirmed.
7.45.231	Population Dynamics and Regulation
7.45.232	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Give examples of how the carrying capacity of a habitat may change Compare and contrast density-dependent growth regulation and density-independent growth regulation, giving examples Give examples of exponential and logistic growth in wild animal populations Describe how natural selection and environmental adaptation leads to the evolution of particular life-history patterns
7.45.233	The logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model, is a simplification of real-world population dynamics.
7.45.234	Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change, which is not the case.
7.45.235	The carrying capacity varies annually: for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet.
7.45.236	In many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer.
7.45.237	Also, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity.
7.45.238	Additionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation.
7.45.239	They engage in interspecific competition: that is, they share the environment with other species, competing with them for the same resources.
7.45.240	These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow.
7.45.241	Nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways.
7.45.242	These are grouped into density-dependent factors, in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, and density-independent factors, which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density.
7.45.243	Note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset.
7.45.244	Conservation biologists want to understand both types because this helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation.
7.45.245	Density-dependent Regulation Most density-dependent factors are biological in nature (biotic), and include predation, inter- and intraspecific competition, accumulation of waste, and diseases such as those caused by parasites.
7.45.246	Usually, the denser a population is, the greater its mortality rate.
7.45.247	For example, during intra- and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the individuals will usually be lower, reducing their population’s rate of growth.
7.45.248	In addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it has more difficulty locating its food source.
7.45.249	An example of density-dependent regulation is shown in Figure 45.11 with results from a study focusing on the giant intestinal roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), a parasite of humans and other mammals.
7.45.250	[4] Denser populations of the parasite exhibited lower fecundity: they contained fewer eggs.
7.45.251	One possible explanation for this is that females would be smaller in more dense populations (due to limited resources) and that smaller females would have fewer eggs.
7.45.252	This hypothesis was tested and disproved in a 2009 study which showed that female weight had no influence.
7.45.253	[5] The actual cause of the densitydependence of fecundity in this organism is still unclear and awaiting further investigation.
7.45.254	In this population of roundworms, fecundity (number of eggs) decreases with population density.
7.45.255	[6] Density-independent Regulation and Interaction with Densitydependent Factors
7.45.256	Many factors, typically physical or chemical in nature (abiotic), influence the mortality of a population regardless of its density, including weather, natural disasters, and pollution.
7.45.257	An individual deer may be killed in a forest fire regardless of how many deer happen to be in that area.
7.45.258	Its chances of survival are the same whether the population density is high or low.
7.45.259	The same holds true for cold winter weather.
7.45.260	In real-life situations, population regulation is very complicated and density-dependent and independent factors can interact.
7.45.261	A dense population that is reduced in a density-independent manner by some environmental factor(s) will be able to recover differently than a sparse population.
7.45.262	For example, a population of deer affected by a harsh winter will recover faster if there are more deer remaining to reproduce.
7.45.263	Life Histories of K-selected and r-selected Species
7.45.264	While reproductive strategies play a key role in life histories, they do not account for important factors like limited resources and competition.
7.45.265	The regulation of population growth by these factors can be used to introduce a classical concept in population biology, that of K-selected versus r-selected species.
7.45.266	Early Theories about Life
7.45.267	History:
7.45.268	K-selected and r-selected Species
7.45.269	By the second half of the twentieth century, the concept of K- and r-selected species was used extensively and successfully to study populations.
7.45.270	The concept relates not only reproductive strategies, but also to a species’ habitat and behavior, especially in the way that they obtain resources and care for their young.
7.45.271	It includes length of life and survivorship factors as well.
7.45.272	For this analysis, population biologists have grouped species into the two large categories—K-selected and rselected— although they are really two ends of a continuum.
7.45.273	K-selected species are species selected by stable, predictable environments.
7.45.274	Populations of K-selected species tend to exist close to their carrying capacity (hence the term K-selected) where intraspecific competition is high.
7.45.275	These species have few, large offspring, a long gestation period, and often give long-term care to their offspring (Table B45_04_01).
7.45.276	While larger in size when born, the offspring are relatively helpless and immature at birth.
7.45.277	By the time they reach adulthood, they must develop skills to compete for natural resources.
7.45.278	In plants, scientists think of parental care more broadly: how long fruit takes to develop or how long it remains on the plant are determining factors in the time to the next reproductive event.
7.45.279	Examples of K-selected species are primates including humans), elephants, and plants such as oak trees (Figure 45.13a).
7.45.280	Oak trees grow very slowly and take, on average, 20 years to produce their first seeds, known as acorns.
7.45.281	As many as 50,000 acorns can be produced by an individual tree, but the germination rate is low as many of these rot or are eaten by animals such as squirrels.
7.45.282	In some years, oaks may produce an exceptionally large number of acorns, and these years may be on a two- or three-year cycle depending on the species of oak (r-selection).
7.45.283	As oak trees grow to a large size and for many years before they begin to produce acorns, they devote a large percentage of their energy budget to growth and maintenance.
7.45.284	The tree’s height and size allow it to dominate other plants in the competition for sunlight, the oak’s primary energy resource.
7.45.285	Furthermore, when it does reproduce, the oak produces large, energy-rich seeds that use their energy reserve to become quickly established (K-selection).
7.45.286	In contrast, r-selected species have a large number of small offspring (hence their r designation (Table 45.2).
7.45.287	This strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments.
7.45.288	Animals that are r-selected do not give long-term parental care and the offspring are relatively mature and self-sufficient at birth.
7.45.289	Examples of r-selected species are marine invertebrates, such as jellyfish, and plants, such as the dandelion (Figure 45.13b).
7.45.290	Dandelions have small seeds that are wind dispersed long distances.
7.45.291	Many seeds are produced simultaneously to ensure that at least some of them reach a hospitable environment.
7.45.292	Seeds that land in inhospitable environments have little chance for survival since their seeds are low in energy content.
7.45.293	Note that survival is not necessarily a function of energy stored in the seed itself.
7.45.294	(a) Elephants are considered K-selected species as they live long, mature late, and provide long-term parental care to few offspring.
7.45.295	Oak trees produce many offspring that do not receive parental care, but are considered K-selected species based on longevity and late maturation.
7.45.296	(b) Dandelions and jellyfish are both considered r-selected species as they mature early, have short lifespans, and produce many offspring that receive no parental care.
7.45.297	Modern Theories of Life
7.45.298	History
7.45.299	The r- and K-selection theory, although accepted for decades and used for much groundbreaking research, has now been reconsidered, and many population biologists have abandoned or modified it.
7.45.300	Over the years, several studies attempted to confirm the theory, but these attempts have largely failed.
7.45.301	Many species were identified that did not follow the theory’s predictions.
7.45.302	Furthermore, the theory ignored the age-specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is very important.
7.45.303	New demographic-based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many ecological concepts included in r- and K-selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors.
7.45.304	Human Population Growth
7.45.305	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Discuss how human population growth can be exponential Explain how humans have expanded the carrying capacity of their habitat Relate population growth and age structure to the level of economic development in different countries Discuss the long-term implications of unchecked human population growth Concepts of animal population dynamics can be applied to human population growth.
7.45.306	Humans are not unique in their ability to alter their environment.
7.45.307	For example, beaver dams alter the stream environment where they are built.
7.45.308	Humans, however, have the ability to alter their environment to increase its carrying capacity sometimes to the detriment of other species (e.g., via artificial selection for crops that have a higher yield).
7.45.309	Earth’s human population is growing rapidly, to the extent that some worry about the ability of the earth’s environment to sustain this population, as long-term exponential growth carries the potential risks of famine, disease, and large-scale death.
7.45.310	Although humans have increased the carrying capacity of their environment, the technologies used to achieve this transformation have caused unprecedented changes to Earth’s environment, altering ecosystems to the point where some may be in danger of collapse.
7.45.311	The depletion of the ozone layer, erosion due to acid rain, and damage from global climate change are caused by human activities.
7.45.312	The ultimate effect of these changes on our carrying capacity is unknown.
7.45.313	As some point out, it is likely that the negative effects of increasing carrying capacity will outweigh the positive ones—the carrying capacity of the world for human beings might actually decrease.
7.45.314	The world’s human population is currently experiencing exponential growth even though human reproduction is far below its biotic potential (Figure 45.14).
7.45.315	To reach its biotic potential, all females would have to become pregnant every nine months or so during their reproductive years.
7.45.316	Also, resources would have to be such that the environment would support such growth.
7.45.317	Neither of these two conditions exists.
7.45.318	In spite of this fact, human population is still growing exponentially.
7.45.319	Human population growth since 1000 AD is exponential (dark blue line).
7.45.320	Notice that while the population in Asia (yellow line), which has many economically underdeveloped countries, is increasing exponentially, the population in Europe (light blue line), where most of the countries are economically developed, is growing much more slowly.
7.45.321	A consequence of exponential human population growth is the time that it takes to add a particular number of humans to the Earth is becoming shorter.
7.45.322	Figure 45.15 shows that 123 years were necessary to add 1 billion humans in 1930, but it only took 24 years to add two billion people between 1975 and 1999.
7.45.323	As already discussed, at some point it would appear that our ability to increase our carrying capacity indefinitely on a finite world is uncertain.
7.45.324	Without new technological advances, the human growth rate has been predicted to slow in the coming decades.
7.45.325	However, the population will still be increasing and the threat of overpopulation remains.
7.45.326	The time between the addition of each billion human beings to Earth decreases over time.
7.45.327	Overcoming Density-Dependent Regulation Humans are unique in their ability to alter their environment with the conscious purpose of increasing its carrying capacity.
7.45.328	This ability is a major factor responsible for human population growth and a way of overcoming density-dependent growth regulation.
7.45.329	Much of this ability is related to human intelligence, society, and communication.
7.45.330	Humans can construct shelter to protect them from the elements and have developed agriculture and domesticated animals to increase their food supplies.
7.45.331	In addition, humans use language to communicate this technology to new generations, allowing them to improve upon previous accomplishments.
7.45.332	Other factors in human population growth are migration and public health.
7.45.333	Humans originated in Africa, but have since migrated to nearly all inhabitable land on the Earth.
7.45.334	Public health, sanitation, and the use of antibiotics and vaccines have decreased the ability of infectious disease to limit human population growth.
7.45.335	In the past, diseases such as the bubonic plaque of the fourteenth century killed between 30 and 60 percent of Europe’s population and reduced the overall world population by as many as 100 million people.
7.45.336	Today, the threat of infectious disease, while not gone, is certainly less severe.
7.45.337	According to the World Health Organization, global death from infectious disease declined from 16.4 million in 1993 to 14.7 million in 1992.
7.45.338	To compare to some of the epidemics of the past, the percentage of the world's population killed between 1993 and 2002 decreased from 0.30 percent of the world's population to 0.24 percent.
7.45.339	Thus, it appears that the influence of infectious disease on human population growth is becoming less significant.
7.45.340	Age Structure, Population Growth, and Economic Development
7.45.341	The age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics.
7.45.342	Age structure is the proportion of a population at different age ranges.
7.45.343	Age structure allows better prediction of population growth, plus the ability to associate this growth with the level of economic development in the region.
7.45.344	Countries with rapid growth have a pyramidal shape in their age structure diagrams, showing a preponderance of younger individuals, many of whom are of reproductive age or will be soon (Figure 45.16).
7.45.345	This pattern is most often observed in underdeveloped countries where individuals do not live to old age because of less-than-optimal living conditions.
7.45.346	Age structures of areas with slow growth, including developed countries such as the United States, still have a pyramidal structure, but with many fewer young and reproductive-aged individuals and a greater proportion of older individuals.
7.45.347	Other developed countries, such as Italy, have zero population growth.
7.45.348	The age structure of these populations is more conical, with an even greater percentage of middle-aged and older individuals.
7.45.349	The actual growth rates in different countries are shown in Figure 45.17, with the highest rates tending to be in the less economically developed countries of Africa and Asia.
7.45.350	The percent growth rate of population in different countries is shown.
7.45.351	Notice that the highest growth is occurring in less economically developed countries in Africa and Asia.
7.45.352	Long-Term Consequences of Exponential Human Population
7.45.353	Growth
7.45.354	Many dire predictions have been made about the world’s population leading to a major crisis called the “population explosion.
7.45.355	”
7.45.356	In the 1968 book The Population Bomb, biologist Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich wrote, “
7.45.357	The battle to feed all of humanity is over.
7.45.358	In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.
7.45.359	At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.
7.45.360	”
7.45.361	[9] While many critics view this statement as an exaggeration, the laws of exponential population growth are still in effect, and unchecked human population growth cannot continue indefinitely.
7.45.362	Efforts to control population growth led to the one-child policy in China, which used to include more severe consequences, but now imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child.
7.45.363	Due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir, many Chinese couples continue to have more than one child.
7.45.364	The policy itself, its social impacts, and the effectiveness of limiting overall population growth are controversial.
7.45.365	In spite of population control policies, the human population continues to grow.
7.45.366	At some point the food supply may run out because of the subsequent need to produce more and more food to feed our population.
7.45.367	The United Nations estimates that future world population growth may vary from 6 billion (a decrease) to 16 billion people by the year 2100.
7.45.368	There is no way to know whether human population growth will moderate to the point where the crisis described by Dr. Ehrlich will be averted.
7.45.369	Another result of population growth is the endangerment of the natural environment.
7.45.370	Many countries have attempted to reduce the human impact on climate change by reducing their emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.
7.45.371	However, these treaties have not been ratified by every country, and many underdeveloped countries trying to improve their economic condition may be less likely to agree with such provisions if it means slower economic development.
7.45.372	Furthermore, the role of human activity in causing climate change has become a hotly debated socio-political issue in some developed countries, including the United States.
7.45.373	Thus, we enter the future with considerable uncertainty about our ability to curb human population growth and protect our environment.
7.45.374	Community Ecology
7.45.375	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Discuss the predator-prey cycle Give examples of defenses against predation and herbivory Describe the competitive exclusion principle Give examples of symbiotic relationships between species Describe community structure and succession Populations rarely, if ever, live in isolation from populations of other species.
7.45.376	In most cases, numerous species share a habitat.
7.45.377	The interactions between these populations play a major role in regulating population growth and abundance.
7.45.378	All populations occupying the same habitat form a community: populations inhabiting a specific area at the same time.
7.45.379	The number of species occupying the same habitat and their relative abundance is known as species diversity.
7.45.380	Areas with low diversity, such as the glaciers of Antarctica, still contain a wide variety of living things, whereas the diversity of tropical rainforests is so great that it cannot be counted.
7.45.381	Ecology is studied at the community level to understand how species interact with each other and compete for the same resources.
7.45.382	Predation and Herbivory Perhaps the classical example of species interaction is predation: the hunting of prey by its predator.
7.45.383	Nature shows on television highlight the drama of one living organism killing another.
7.45.384	Populations of predators and prey in a community are not constant over time: in most cases, they vary in cycles that appear to be related.
7.45.385	The most often cited example of predator-prey dynamics is seen in the cycling of the lynx (predator) and the snowshoe hare (prey), using nearly 200 year-old trapping data from North American forests (Figure 45.18).
7.45.386	This cycle of predator and prey lasts approximately 10 years, with the predator population lagging 1–2 years behind that of the prey population.
7.45.387	As the hare numbers increase, there is more food available for the lynx, allowing the lynx population to increase as well.
7.45.388	When the lynx population grows to a threshold level, however, they kill so many hares that hare population begins to decline, followed by a decline in the lynx population because of scarcity of food.
7.45.389	When the lynx population is low, the hare population size begins to increase due, at least in part, to low predation pressure, starting the cycle anew.
7.45.390	The cycling of lynx and snowshoe hare populations in Northern Ontario is an example of predator-prey dynamics.
7.45.391	The idea that the population cycling of the two species is entirely controlled by predation models has come under question.
7.45.392	More recent studies have pointed to undefined density-dependent factors as being important in the cycling, in addition to predation.
7.45.393	One possibility is that the cycling is inherent in the hare population due to density-dependent effects such as lower fecundity (maternal stress) caused by crowding when the hare population gets too dense.
7.45.394	The hare cycling would then induce the cycling of the lynx because it is the lynxes’ major food source.
7.45.395	The more we study communities, the more complexities we find, allowing ecologists to derive more accurate and sophisticated models of population dynamics.
7.45.396	Herbivory describes the consumption of plants by insects and other animals, and it is another interspecific relationship that affects populations.
7.45.397	Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals.
7.45.398	Some plants have developed mechanisms to defend against herbivory.
7.45.399	Other species have developed mutualistic relationships; for example, herbivory provides a mechanism of seed distribution that aids in plant reproduction.
7.45.400	Defense Mechanisms against Predation and Herbivory
7.45.401	The study of communities must consider evolutionary forces that act on the members of the various populations contained within it.
7.45.402	Species are not static, but slowly changing and adapting to their environment by natural selection and other evolutionary forces.
7.45.403	Species have evolved numerous mechanisms to escape predation and herbivory.
7.45.404	These defenses may be mechanical, chemical, physical, or behavioral.
7.45.405	Mechanical defenses, such as the presence of thorns on plants or the hard shell on turtles, discourage animal predation and herbivory by causing physical pain to the predator or by physically preventing the predator from being able to eat the prey.
7.45.406	Chemical defenses are produced by many animals as well as plants, such as the foxglove which is extremely toxic when eaten.
7.45.407	Figure 45.19 shows some organisms’ defenses against predation and herbivory.
7.45.408	The (a) honey locust tree (Gleditsia triacanthos) uses thorns, a mechanical defense, against herbivores, while the (b) Florida red-bellied turtle (Pseudemys nelsoni) uses its shell as a mechanical defense against predators.
7.45.409	(c) Foxglove (Digitalis sp.) uses a chemical defense:
7.45.410	toxins produced by the plant can cause nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, convulsions, or death when consumed.
7.45.411	(d)
7.45.412	The North American millipede (Narceus americanus) uses both mechanical and chemical defenses: when threatened, the millipede curls into a defensive ball and produces a noxious substance that irritates eyes and skin.
7.45.413	Many species use their body shape and coloration to avoid being detected by predators.
7.45.414	The tropical walking stick is an insect with the coloration and body shape of a twig which makes it very hard to see when stationary against a background of real twigs (Figure 45.20a).
7.45.415	In another example, the chameleon can change its color to match its surroundings (Figure 45.20b).
7.45.416	Both of these are examples of camouflage, or avoiding detection by blending in with the background.
7.45.417	(a)
7.45.418	The tropical walking stick and (b) the chameleon use body shape and/or coloration to prevent detection by predators.
7.45.419	Some species use coloration as a way of warning predators that they are not good to eat.
7.45.420	For example, the cinnabar moth caterpillar, the fire-bellied toad, and many species of beetle have bright colors that warn of a foul taste, the presence of toxic chemical, and/or the ability to sting or bite, respectively.
7.45.421	Predators that ignore this coloration and eat the organisms will experience their unpleasant taste or presence of toxic chemicals and learn not to eat them in the future.
7.45.422	This type of defensive mechanism is called aposematic coloration, or warning coloration.
7.45.423	(a)
7.45.424	The strawberry poison dart frog (Oophaga pumilio) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators that it is toxic, while the (b) striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators of the unpleasant odor it produces.
7.45.425	While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration, other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals.
7.45.426	In Batesian mimicry, a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one.
7.45.427	Assuming they share the same predators, this coloration then protects the harmless ones, even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic.
7.45.428	Many insect species mimic the coloration of wasps or bees, which are stinging, venomous insects, thereby discouraging predation.
7.45.429	Batesian mimicry occurs when a harmless species mimics the coloration of a harmful species, as is seen with the (a) bumblebee and (b) bee-like robber fly.
7.45.430	In Müllerian mimicry, multiple species share the same warning coloration, but all of them actually have defenses.
7.45.431	Figure 45.23 shows a variety of foul-tasting butterflies with similar coloration.
7.45.432	In Emsleyan/Mertensian mimicry, a deadly prey mimics a less dangerous one, such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the non-venomous milk snake.
7.45.433	This type of mimicry is extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types.
7.45.434	For this type of mimicry to work, it is essential that eating the milk snake has unpleasant but not fatal consequences.
7.45.435	Then, these predators learn not to eat snakes with this coloration, protecting the coral snake as well.
7.45.436	If the snake were fatal to the predator, there would be no opportunity for the predator to learn not to eat it, and the benefit for the less toxic species would disappear.
7.45.437	Several unpleasant-tasting Heliconius butterfly species share a similar color pattern with better-tasting varieties, an example of Müllerian mimicry.
7.45.438	Competitive Exclusion Principle Resources are often limited within a habitat and multiple species may compete to obtain them.
7.45.439	All species have an ecological niche in the ecosystem, which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with other species in the community.
7.45.440	The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot occupy the same niche in a habitat.
7.45.441	In other words, different species cannot coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources.
7.45.442	An example of this principle is shown in Figure 45.24, with two protozoan species, Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum.
7.45.443	When grown individually in the laboratory, they both thrive.
7.45.444	But when they are placed together in the same test tube (habitat), P. aurelia outcompetes P. caudatum for food, leading to the latter’s eventual extinction.
7.45.445	Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum grow well individually, but when they compete for the same resources, the P. aurelia outcompetes the P. caudatum.
7.45.446	This exclusion may be avoided if a population evolves to make use of a different resource, a different area of the habitat, or feeds during a different time of day, called resource partitioning.
7.45.447	The two organisms are then said to occupy different microniches.
7.45.448	These organisms coexist by minimizing direct competition.
7.45.449	Symbiosis Symbiotic relationships, or symbioses (plural), are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations.
7.45.450	Most scientists accept this definition, but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic, where both individuals benefit from the interaction.
7.45.451	In this discussion, the broader definition will be used.
7.45.452	Commensalism A commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close, prolonged interaction, while the other neither benefits nor is harmed.
7.45.453	Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship (Figure 45.25).
7.45.454	The tree is not harmed by the presence of the nest among its branches.
7.45.455	The nests are light and produce little strain on the structural integrity of the branch, and most of the leaves, which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are above the nest so they are unaffected.
7.45.456	The bird, on the other hand, benefits greatly.
7.45.457	If the bird had to nest in the open, its eggs and young would be vulnerable to predators.
7.45.458	Another example of a commensal relationship is the clown fish and the sea anemone.
7.45.459	The sea anemone is not harmed by the fish, and the fish benefits with protection from predators who would be stung upon nearing the sea anemone.
7.45.460	The southern masked-weaver bird is starting to make a nest in a tree in Zambezi Valley, Zambia.
7.45.461	This is an example of a commensal relationship, in which one species (the bird) benefits, while the other (the tree) neither benefits nor is harmed.
7.45.462	Mutualism
7.45.463	A second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism, where two species benefit from their interaction.
7.45.464	Some scientists believe that these are the only true examples of symbiosis.
7.45.465	For example, termites have a mutualistic relationship with protozoa that live in the insect’s gut
7.45.466	(Figure 45.26a).
7.45.467	The termite benefits from the ability of bacterial symbionts within the protozoa to digest cellulose.
7.45.468	The termite itself cannot do this, and without the protozoa, it would not be able to obtain energy from its food (cellulose from the wood it chews and eats).
7.45.469	The protozoa and the bacterial symbionts benefit by having a protective environment and a constant supply of food from the wood chewing actions of the termite.
7.45.470	Lichens have a mutualistic relationship between fungus and photosynthetic algae or bacteria (Figure 45.26b).
7.45.471	As these symbionts grow together, the glucose produced by the algae provides nourishment for both organisms, whereas the physical structure of the lichen protects the algae from the elements and makes certain nutrients in the atmosphere more available to the algae.
7.45.472	(a) Termites form a mutualistic relationship with symbiotic protozoa in their guts, which allow both organisms to obtain energy from the cellulose the termite consumes.
7.45.473	(b)
7.45.474	Lichen is a fungus that has symbiotic photosynthetic algae living inside its cells.
7.45.475	Parasitism
7.45.476	A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it.
7.45.477	In this relationship, the parasite benefits, but the organism being fed upon, the host is harmed.
7.45.478	The host is usually weakened by the parasite as it siphons resources the host would normally use to maintain itself.
7.45.479	The parasite, however, is unlikely to kill the host, especially not quickly, because this would allow no time for the organism to complete its reproductive cycle by spreading to another host.
7.45.480	The reproductive cycles of parasites are often very complex, sometimes requiring more than one host species.
7.45.481	A tapeworm is a parasite that causes disease in humans when contaminated, undercooked meat such as pork, fish, or beef is consumed (Figure 45.27).
7.45.482	The tapeworm can live inside the intestine of the host for several years, benefiting from the food the host is bringing into its gut by eating, and may grow to be over 50 ft long by adding segments.
7.45.483	The parasite moves from species to species in a cycle, making two hosts necessary to complete its life cycle.
7.45.484	Another common parasite is Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan cause of malaria, a significant disease in many parts of the world.
7.45.485	Living in human liver and red blood cells, the organism reproduces asexually in the gut of blood-feeding mosquitoes to complete its life cycle.
7.45.486	Thus malaria is spread from human to human by mosquitoes, one of many arthropod-borne infectious diseases.
7.45.487	This diagram shows the life cycle of a pork tapeworm (Taenia solium), a human worm parasite.
7.45.488	Characteristics of Communities Communities are complex entities that can be characterized by their structure (the types and numbers of species present) and dynamics (how communities change over time).
7.45.489	Understanding community structure and dynamics enables community ecologists to manage ecosystems more effectively.
7.45.490	Foundation Species Foundation species are considered the “base” or “bedrock” of a community, having the greatest influence on its overall structure.
7.45.491	They are usually the primary producers: organisms that bring most of the energy into the community.
7.45.492	Kelp, brown algae, is a foundation species, forming the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of California.
7.45.493	Foundation species may physically modify the environment to produce and maintain habitats that benefit the other organisms that use them.
7.45.494	An example is the photosynthetic corals of the coral reef (Figure 45.28).
7.45.495	Corals themselves are not photosynthetic, but harbor symbionts within their body tissues (dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae) that perform photosynthesis; this is another example of a mutualism.
7.45.496	The exoskeletons of living and dead coral make up most of the reef structure, which protects many other species from waves and ocean currents.
7.45.497	Coral is the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems.
7.45.498	Biodiversity, Species Richness, and Relative Species Abundance Biodiversity describes a community’s biological complexity: it is measured by the number of different species (species richness) in a particular area and their relative abundance (species evenness).
7.45.499	The area in question could be a habitat, a biome, or the entire biosphere.
7.45.500	Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome.
7.45.501	Species richness varies across the globe (Figure 45.29).
7.45.502	One factor in determining species richness is latitude, with the greatest species richness occurring in ecosystems near the equator, which often have warmer temperatures, large amounts of rainfall, and low seasonality.
7.45.503	The lowest species richness occurs near the poles, which are much colder, drier, and thus less conducive to life in Geologic time (time since glaciations).
7.45.504	The predictability of climate or productivity is also an important factor.
7.45.505	Other factors influence species richness as well.
7.45.506	For example, the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains, including the Galápagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin.
7.45.507	Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat, ecosystem, or biome.
7.45.508	Foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species.
7.45.509	The greatest species richness for mammals in North and South America is associated with the equatorial latitudes.
7.45.510	Keystone Species
7.45.511	A keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an ecological community’s structure.
7.45.512	The intertidal sea star, Pisaster ochraceus, of the northwestern United States is a keystone species (Figure 45.30).
7.45.513	Studies have shown that when this organism is removed from communities, populations of their natural prey (mussels) increase, completely altering the species composition and reducing biodiversity.
7.45.514	Another keystone species is the banded tetra, a fish in tropical streams, which supplies nearly all of the phosphorus, a necessary inorganic nutrient, to the rest of the community.
7.45.515	If these fish were to become extinct, the community would be greatly affected.
7.45.516	The Pisaster ochraceus sea star is a keystone species.
7.45.517	Community Dynamics Community dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time.
7.45.518	Sometimes these changes are induced by environmental disturbances such as volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, fires, and climate change.
7.45.519	Communities with a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium.
7.45.520	Following a disturbance, the community may or may not return to the equilibrium state.
7.45.521	Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time.
7.45.522	In primary succession, newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things; in secondary succession, part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain.
7.45.523	Primary Succession and
7.45.524	Pioneer Species Primary succession occurs when new land is formed or rock is exposed: for example, following the eruption of volcanoes, such as those on the Big Island of Hawaii.
7.45.525	As lava flows into the ocean, new land is continually being formed.
7.45.526	On the Big Island, approximately 32 acres of land is added each year.
7.45.527	First, weathering and other natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements, known as pioneer species (Figure 45.32).
7.45.528	These species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other, less hardy species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species.
7.45.529	In addition, as these early species grow and die, they add to an ever-growing layer of decomposing organic material and contribute to soil formation.
7.45.530	Over time the area will reach an equilibrium state, with a set of organisms quite different from the pioneer species.
7.45.531	During primary succession in lava on Maui, Hawaii, succulent plants are the pioneer species.
7.45.532	Secondary succession
7.45.533	A classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire (Figure 45.33).
7.45.534	Wildfires will burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area.
7.45.535	Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form of ash.
7.45.536	Thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to take hold.
7.45.537	Before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight.
7.45.538	Their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species.
7.45.539	After the fire, though, these trees are no longer dominant.
7.45.540	Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species.
7.45.541	Due to, at least in part, changes in the environment brought on by the growth of the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine, oak, and hickory trees.
7.45.542	These organisms are called intermediate species.
7.45.543	Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire.
7.45.544	This equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community, which will remain stable until the next disturbance.
7.45.545	Secondary succession is shown in an oak and hickory forest after a forest fire.

7.45.547	Behavioral Biology:
7.45.548	Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior
7.45.549	By the end of this section, you will be able to: •
7.45.550	Compare innate and learned behavior
7.45.551	• Discuss how movement and migration behaviors are a result of natural selection
7.45.552	•
7.45.553	Discuss the different ways members of a population communicate with each other
7.45.554	• Give examples of how species use energy for mating displays and other courtship behaviors •
7.45.555	Differentiate between various mating systems •
7.45.556	Describe different ways that species learn Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus.
7.45.557	Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes.
7.45.558	The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new.
7.45.559	Animal behavior has been studied for decades, by biologists in the science of ethology, by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology, and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology.
7.45.560	Although there is overlap between these disciplines, scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches.
7.45.561	Comparative psychology is an extension of work done in human and behavioral psychology.
7.45.562	Ethology is an extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines.
7.45.563	Still, one cannot study behavioral biology without touching on both comparative psychology and ethology.
7.45.564	One goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning.
7.45.565	Innate behavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned.
7.45.566	They are “hard wired” into the system.
7.45.567	On the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are flexible, dynamic, and can be altered according to changes in the environment.
7.45.568	Innate Behaviors: Movement and Migration Innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli.
7.45.569	The simplest example of this is a reflex action, an involuntary and rapid response to stimulus.
7.45.570	To test the “knee-jerk” reflex, a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber hammer.
7.45.571	The stimulation of the nerves there leads to the reflex of extending the leg at the knee.
7.45.572	This is similar to the reaction of someone who touches a hot stove and instinctually pulls his or her hand away.
7.45.573	Even humans, with our great capacity to learn, still exhibit a variety of innate behaviors.
7.45.574	Kinesis and Taxis
7.45.575	Another activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis, or the undirected movement in response to a stimulus.
7.45.576	Orthokinesis is the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus.
7.45.577	Woodlice, for example, increase their speed of movement when exposed to high or low temperatures.
7.45.578	This movement, although random, increases the probability that the insect spends less time in the unfavorable environment.
7.45.579	Another example is klinokinesis, an increase in turning behaviors.
7.45.580	It is exhibited by bacteria such as E. coli which, in association with orthokinesis, helps the organisms randomly find a more hospitable environment.
7.45.581	A similar, but more directed version of kinesis is taxis: the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus.
7.45.582	This movement can be in response to light (phototaxis), chemical signals (chemotaxis), or gravity (geotaxis) and can be directed toward (positive) or away (negative) from the source of the stimulus.
7.45.583	An example of a positive chemotaxis is exhibited by the unicellular protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila.
7.45.584	This organism swims using its cilia, at times moving in a straight line, and at other times making turns.
7.45.585	The attracting chemotactic agent alters the frequency of turning as the organism moves directly toward the source, following the increasing concentration gradient.
7.45.586	Fixed Action Patterns A fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed, the pattern goes on to completion.
7.45.587	An example of such a behavior occurs in the three-spined stickleback, a small freshwater fish (Figure 45.34).
7.45.588	Males of this species develop a red belly during breeding season and show instinctual aggressiveness to other males during this time.
7.45.589	In laboratory experiments, researchers exposed such fish to objects that in no way resemble a fish in their shape, but which were painted red on their lower halves.
7.45.590	The male sticklebacks responded aggressively to the objects just as if they were real male sticklebacks.
7.45.591	Male three-spined stickleback fish exhibit a fixed action pattern.
7.45.592	During mating season, the males, which develop a bright red belly, react strongly to red-bottomed objects that in no way resemble fish.
7.45.593	Migration Migration is the long-range seasonal movement of animals.
7.45.594	It is an evolved, adapted response to variation in resource availability, and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals.
7.45.595	Birds fly south for the winter to get to warmer climates with sufficient food, and salmon migrate to their spawning grounds.
7.45.596	The popular 2005 documentary March of the Penguins followed the 62-mile migration of emperor penguins through Antarctica to bring food back to their breeding site and to their young.
7.45.597	Wildebeests (Figure 45.35) migrate over 1800 miles each year in search of new grasslands.
7.45.598	Wildebeests migrate in a clockwise fashion over 1800 miles each year in search of rain-ripened grass.
7.45.599	Although migration is thought of as innate behavior, only some migrating species always migrate (obligate migration).
7.45.600	Animals that exhibit facultative migration can choose to migrate or not.
7.45.601	Additionally, in some animals, only a portion of the population migrates, whereas the rest does not migrate (incomplete migration).
7.45.602	For example, owls that live in the tundra may migrate in years when their food source, small rodents, is relatively scarce, but not migrate during the years when rodents are plentiful.
7.45.603	Foraging Foraging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources.
7.45.604	Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors, and these are favored by natural section.
7.45.605	The painted stork, for example, uses its long beak to search the bottom of a freshwater marshland for crabs and other food.
7.45.606	The painted stork uses its long beak to forage.
7.45.607	Innate Behaviors:
7.45.608	Living in Groups Not all animals live in groups, but even those that live relatively solitary lives, with the exception of those that can reproduce asexually, must mate.
7.45.609	Mating usually involves one animal signaling another so as to communicate the desire to mate.
7.45.610	There are several types of energy-intensive behaviors or displays associated with mating, called mating rituals.
7.45.611	Other behaviors found in populations that live in groups are described in terms of which animal benefits from the behavior.
7.45.612	In selfish behavior, only the animal in question benefits; in altruistic behavior, one animal’s actions benefit another animal; cooperative behavior describes when both animals benefit.
7.45.613	All of these behaviors involve some sort of communication between population members.
7.45.614	Communication within a Species Animals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals.
7.45.615	An example of this is seen in the three-spined stickleback, where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals females to mate.
7.45.616	Other signals are chemical (pheromones), aural (sound), visual (courtship and aggressive displays), or tactile (touch).
7.45.617	These types of communication may be instinctual or learned or a combination of both.
7.45.618	These are not the same as the communication we associate with language, which has been observed only in humans and perhaps in some species of primates and cetaceans.
7.45.619	A pheromone is a secreted chemical signal used to obtain a response from another individual of the same species.
7.45.620	The purpose of pheromones is to elicit a specific behavior from the receiving individual.
7.45.621	Pheromones are especially common among social insects, but they are used by many species to attract the opposite sex, to sound alarms, to mark food trails, and to elicit other, more complex behaviors.
7.45.622	Even humans are thought to respond to certain pheromones called axillary steroids.
7.45.623	These chemicals influence human perception of other people, and in one study were responsible for a group of women synchronizing their menstrual cycles.
7.45.624	The role of pheromones in human-to-human communication is still somewhat controversial and continues to be researched.
7.45.625	Songs are an example of an aural signal, one that needs to be heard by the recipient.
7.45.626	Perhaps the best known of these are songs of birds, which identify the species and are used to attract mates.
7.45.627	Other well-known songs are those of whales, which are of such low frequency that they can travel long distances underwater.
7.45.628	Dolphins communicate with each other using a wide variety of vocalizations.
7.45.629	Male crickets make chirping sounds using a specialized organ to attract a mate, repel other males, and to announce a successful mating.
7.45.630	Courtship displays are a series of ritualized visual behaviors (signals) designed to attract and convince a member of the opposite sex to mate.
7.45.631	These displays are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom.
7.45.632	Often these displays involve a series of steps, including an initial display by one member followed by a response from the other.
7.45.633	If at any point, the display is performed incorrectly or a proper response is not given, the mating ritual is abandoned and the mating attempt will be unsuccessful.
7.45.634	The mating display of the common stork is shown in Figure 45.37.
7.45.635	Aggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom.
7.45.636	An example is when a dog bares its teeth when it wants another dog to back down.
7.45.637	Presumably, these displays communicate not only the willingness of the animal to fight, but also its fighting ability.
7.45.638	Although these displays do signal aggression on the part of the sender, it is thought that these displays are actually a mechanism to reduce the amount of actual fighting that occurs between members of the same species: they allow individuals to assess the fighting ability of their opponent and thus decide whether it is “worth the fight.
7.45.639	”
7.45.640	The testing of certain hypotheses using game theory has led to the conclusion that some of these displays may overstate an animal’s actual fighting ability and are used to “bluff” the opponent.
7.45.641	This type of interaction, even if “dishonest,” would be favored by natural selection if it is successful more times than not.
7.45.642	This stork’s courtship display is designed to attract potential mates.
7.45.643	Distraction displays are seen in birds and some fish.
7.45.644	They are designed to attract a predator away from the nest that contains their young.
7.45.645	This is an example of an altruistic behavior: it benefits the young more than the individual performing the display, which is putting itself at risk by doing so.
7.45.646	Many animals, especially primates, communicate with other members in the group through touch.
7.45.647	Activities such as grooming, touching the shoulder or root of the tail, embracing, lip contact, and greeting ceremonies have all been observed in the Indian langur, an Old World monkey.
7.45.648	Similar behaviors are found in other primates, especially in the great apes.
7.45.649	Altruistic Behaviors Behaviors that lower the fitness of the individual but increase the fitness of another individual are termed altruistic.
7.45.650	Examples of such behaviors are seen widely across the animal kingdom.
7.45.651	Social insects such as worker bees have no ability to reproduce, yet they maintain the queen so she can populate the hive with her offspring.
7.45.652	Meerkats keep a sentry standing guard to warn the rest of the colony about intruders, even though the sentry is putting itself at risk.
7.45.653	Wolves and wild dogs bring meat to pack members not present during a hunt.
7.45.654	Lemurs take care of infants unrelated to them.
7.45.655	Although on the surface, these behaviors appear to be altruistic, it may not be so simple.
7.45.656	There has been much discussion over why altruistic behaviors exist.
7.45.657	Do these behaviors lead to overall evolutionary advantages for their species?
7.45.658	Do they help the altruistic individual pass on its own genes?
7.45.659	And what about such activities between unrelated individuals?
7.45.660	One explanation for altruistic-type behaviors is found in the genetics of natural selection.
7.45.661	In the 1976 book, The Selfish Gene, scientist Richard Dawkins attempted to explain many seemingly altruistic behaviors from the viewpoint of the gene itself.
7.45.662	Although a gene obviously cannot be selfish in the human sense, it may appear that way if the sacrifice of an individual benefits related individuals that share genes that are identical by descent (present in relatives because of common lineage).
7.45.663	Mammal parents make this sacrifice to take care of their offspring.
7.45.664	Emperor penguins migrate miles in harsh conditions to bring food back for their young.
7.45.665	Selfish gene theory has been controversial over the years and is still discussed among scientists in related fields.
7.45.666	Even less-related individuals, those with less genetic identity than that shared by parent and offspring, benefit from seemingly altruistic behavior.
7.45.667	The activities of social insects such as bees, wasps, ants, and termites are good examples.
7.45.668	Sterile workers in these societies take care of the queen because they are closely related to it, and as the queen has offspring, she is passing on genes from the workers indirectly.
7.45.669	Thus, it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen without having any direct chance of passing on its genes due to its sterility.
7.45.670	The lowering of individual fitness to enhance the reproductive fitness of a relative and thus one’s inclusive fitness evolves through kin selection.
7.45.671	This phenomenon can explain many superficially altruistic behaviors seen in animals.
7.45.672	However, these behaviors may not be truly defined as altruism in these cases because the actor is actually increasing its own fitness either directly (through its own offspring) or indirectly (through the inclusive fitness it gains through relatives that share genes with it).
7.45.673	Unrelated individuals may also act altruistically to each other, and this seems to defy the “selfish gene” explanation.
7.45.674	An example of this observed in many monkey species where a monkey will present its back to an unrelated monkey to have that individual pick the parasites from its fur.
7.45.675	After a certain amount of time, the roles are reversed and the first monkey now grooms the second monkey.
7.45.676	Thus, there is reciprocity in the behavior.
7.45.677	Both benefit from the interaction and their fitness is raised more than if neither cooperated nor if one cooperated and the other did not cooperate.
7.45.678	This behavior is still not necessarily altruism, as the “giving” behavior of the actor is based on the expectation that it will be the “receiver” of the behavior in the future, termed reciprocal altruism.
7.45.679	Reciprocal altruism requires that individuals repeatedly encounter each other, often the result of living in the same social group, and that cheaters (those that never “give back”) are punished.
7.45.680	Evolutionary game theory, a modification of classical game theory in mathematics, has shown that many of these so-called “altruistic behaviors” are not altruistic at all.
7.45.681	The definition of “pure” altruism, based on human behavior, is an action that benefits another without any direct benefit to oneself.
7.45.682	Most of the behaviors previously described do not seem to satisfy this definition, and game theorists are good at finding “selfish” components in them.
7.45.683	Others have argued that the terms “selfish” and “altruistic” should be dropped completely when discussing animal behavior, as they describe human behavior and may not be directly applicable to instinctual animal activity.
7.45.684	What is clear, though, is that heritable behaviors that improve the chances of passing on one’s genes or a portion of one’s genes are favored by natural selection and will be retained in future generations as long as those behaviors convey a fitness advantage.
7.45.685	These instinctual behaviors may then be applied, in special circumstances, to other species, as long as it doesn’t lower the animal’s fitness.
7.45.686	Finding Sex Partners
7.45.687	Not all animals reproduce sexually, but many that do have the same challenge: they need to find a suitable mate and often have to compete with other individuals to obtain one.
7.45.688	Significant energy is spent in the process of locating, attracting, and mating with the sex partner.
7.45.689	Two types of selection occur during this process and can lead to traits that are important to reproduction called secondary sexual characteristics: intersexual selection, the choosing of a mate where individuals of one sex choose mates of the other sex, and intrasexual selection, the competition for mates between species members of the same sex.
7.45.690	Intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual, aural, tactile, and chemical cues.
7.45.691	An example of intersexual selection is when female peacocks choose to mate with the male with the brightest plumage.
7.45.692	This type of selection often leads to traits in the chosen sex that do not enhance survival, but are those traits most attractive to the opposite sex (often at the expense of survival).
7.45.693	Intrasexual selection involves mating displays and aggressive mating rituals such as rams butting heads—the winner of these battles is the one that is able to mate.
7.45.694	Many of these rituals use up considerable energy but result in the selection of the healthiest, strongest, and/or most dominant individuals for mating.
7.45.695	Three general mating systems, all involving innate as opposed to learned behaviors, are seen in animal populations: monogamous, polygynous, and polyandrous.
7.45.696	In monogamous systems, one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season.
7.45.697	In some animals, such as the gray wolf, these associations can last much longer, even a lifetime.
7.45.698	Several explanations have been proposed for this type of mating system.
7.45.699	The “mate-guarding hypothesis” states that males stay with the female to prevent other males from mating with her.
7.45.700	This behavior is advantageous in such situations where mates are scarce and difficult to find.
7.45.701	Another explanation is the “male-assistance hypothesis,” where males that remain with a female to help guard and rear their young will have more and healthier offspring.
7.45.702	Monogamy is observed in many bird populations where, in addition to the parental care from the female, the male is also a major provider of parental care for the chicks.
7.45.703	A third explanation for the evolutionary advantages of monogamy is the “female-enforcement hypothesis.
7.45.704	”
7.45.705	In this scenario, the female ensures that the male does not have other offspring that might compete with her own, so she actively interferes with the male’s signaling to attract other mates.
7.45.706	Polygynous mating refers to one male mating with multiple females.
7.45.707	In these situations, the female must be responsible for most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring.
7.45.708	In resourced-based polygyny, males compete for territories with the best resources, and then mate with females that enter the territory, drawn to its resource richness.
7.45.709	The female benefits by mating with a dominant, genetically fit male; however, it is at the cost of having no male help in caring for the offspring.
7.45.710	An example is seen in the yellow-rumped honeyguide, a bird whose males defend beehives because the females feed on their wax.
7.45.711	As the females approach, the male defending the nest will mate with them.
7.45.712	Harem mating structures are a type of polygynous system where certain males dominate mating while controlling a territory with resources.
7.45.713	Elephant seals, where the alpha male dominates the mating within the group are an example.
7.45.714	A third type of polygyny is a lek system.
7.45.715	Here there is a communal courting area where several males perform elaborate displays for females, and the females choose their mate from this group.
7.45.716	This behavior is observed in several bird species including the sage grouse and the prairie chicken.
7.45.717	In polyandrous mating systems, one female mates with many males.
7.45.718	These types of systems are much rarer than monogamous and polygynous mating systems.
7.45.719	In pipefishes and seahorses, males receive the eggs from the female, fertilize them, protect them within a pouch, and give birth to the offspring (Figure 45.38).
7.45.720	Therefore, the female is able to provide eggs to several males without the burden of carrying the fertilized eggs.
7.45.721	Polyandrous mating, in which one female mates with many males, occurs in the (a) seahorse and the (b) pipefish.
7.45.722	Simple Learned Behaviors
7.45.723	The majority of the behaviors previously discussed were innate or at least have an innate component (variations on the innate behaviors may be learned).
7.45.724	They are inherited and the behaviors do not change in response to signals from the environment.
7.45.725	Conversely, learned behaviors, even though they may have instinctive components, allow an organism to adapt to changes in the environment and are modified by previous experiences.
7.45.726	Simple learned behaviors include habituation and imprinting—both are important to the maturation process of young animals.
7.45.727	Habituation Habituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure.
7.45.728	This is a form of non-associative learning, as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward.
7.45.729	Prairie dogs typically sound an alarm call when threatened by a predator, but they become habituated to the sound of human footsteps when no harm is associated with this sound, therefore, they no longer respond to them with an alarm call.
7.45.730	In this example, habituation is specific to the sound of human footsteps, as the animals still respond to the sounds of potential predators.
7.45.731	Imprinting Imprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species involved.
7.45.732	Hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see, their mother, and make a bond with her.
7.45.733	A familiar sight is ducklings walking or swimming after their mothers (Figure 45.39).
7.45.734	This is another type of non-associative learning, but is very important in the maturation process of these animals as it encourages them to stay near their mother so they will be protected, greatly increasing their chances of survival.
7.45.735	However, if newborn ducks see a human before they see their mother, they will imprint on the human and follow it in just the same manner as they would follow their real mother.
7.45.736	The attachment of ducklings to their mother is an example of imprinting.
7.45.737	Conditioned
7.45.738	Behavior Conditioned behaviors are types of associative learning, where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence.
7.45.739	During operant conditioning, the behavioral response is modified by its consequences, with regards to its form, strength, or frequency.
7.45.740	Classical Conditioning
7.45.741	In classical conditioning, a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not been associated with, the conditioned stimulus.
7.45.742	The response to the original, unconditioned stimulus is called the unconditioned response.
7.45.743	The most cited example of classical conditioning is Ivan Pavlov’s experiments with dogs (Figure 45.40).
7.45.744	In Pavlov’s experiments, the unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to the unconditioned stimulus of seeing or smelling their food.
7.45.745	The conditioning stimulus that researchers associated with the unconditioned response was the ringing of a bell.
7.45.746	During conditioning, every time the animal was given food, the bell was rung.
7.45.747	This was repeated during several trials.
7.45.748	After some time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food and to respond by salivating.
7.45.749	After the conditioning period was finished, the dog would respond by salivating when the bell was rung, even when the unconditioned stimulus, the food, was absent.
7.45.750	Thus, the ringing of the bell became the conditioned stimulus and the salivation became the conditioned response.
7.45.751	Although it is thought by some scientists that the unconditioned and conditioned responses are identical, even Pavlov discovered that the saliva in the conditioned dogs had characteristic differences when compared to the unconditioned dog.
7.45.752	In the classic Pavlovian response, the dog becomes conditioned to associate the ringing of the bell with food.
7.45.753	It had been thought by some scientists that this type of conditioning required multiple exposures to the paired stimulus and response, but it is now known that this is not necessary in all cases, and that some conditioning can be learned in a single pairing experiment.
7.45.754	Classical conditioning is a major tenet of behaviorism, a branch of psychological philosophy that proposes that all actions, thoughts, and emotions of living things are behaviors that can be treated by behavior modification and changes in the environment.
7.45.755	Operant Conditioning
7.45.756	In operant conditioning, the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal responds to the stimulus.
7.45.757	A major proponent of such conditioning was psychologist B.F. Skinner, the inventor of the Skinner box.
7.45.758	Skinner put rats in his boxes that contained a lever that would dispense food to the rat when depressed.
7.45.759	While initially the rat would push the lever a few times by accident, it eventually associated pushing the lever with getting the food.
7.45.760	This type of learning is an example of operant conditioning.
7.45.761	Operant learning is the basis of most animal training.
7.45.762	The conditioned behavior is continually modified by positive or negative reinforcement, often a reward such as food or some type of punishment, respectively.
7.45.763	In this way, the animal is conditioned to associate a type of behavior with the punishment or reward, and, over time, can be induced to perform behaviors that they would not have done in the wild, such as the “tricks” dolphins perform at marine amusement park shows.
7.45.764	The training of dolphins by rewarding them with food is an example of positive reinforcement operant conditioning.
7.45.765	Cognitive Learning Classical and operant conditioning are inefficient ways for humans and other intelligent animals to learn.
7.45.766	Some primates, including humans, are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions.
7.45.767	The development of complex language by humans has made cognitive learning, the manipulation of information using the mind, the most prominent method of human learning.
7.45.768	In fact, that is how students are learning right now by reading this book.
7.45.769	As students read, they can make mental images of objects or organisms and imagine changes to them, or behaviors by them, and anticipate the consequences.
7.45.770	In addition to visual processing, cognitive learning is also enhanced by remembering past experiences, touching physical objects, hearing sounds, tasting food, and a variety of other sensory-based inputs.
7.45.771	Cognitive learning is so powerful that it can be used to understand conditioning in detail.
7.45.772	In the reverse scenario, conditioning cannot help someone learn about cognition.
7.45.773	Classic work on cognitive learning was done by Wolfgang Köhler with chimpanzees.
7.45.774	He demonstrated that these animals were capable of abstract thought by showing that they could learn how to solve a puzzle.
7.45.775	When a banana was hung in their cage too high for them to reach, and several boxes were placed randomly on the floor, some of the chimps were able to stack the boxes one on top of the other, climb on top of them, and get the banana.
7.45.776	This implies that they could visualize the result of stacking the boxes even before they had performed the action.
7.45.777	This type of learning is much more powerful and versatile than conditioning.
7.45.778	Cognitive learning is not limited to primates, although they are the most efficient in using it.
7.45.779	Maze running experiments done with rats by H.C. Blodgett in the 1920s were the first to show cognitive skills in a simple mammal.
7.45.780	The motivation for the animals to work their way through the maze was a piece of food at its end.
7.45.781	In these studies, the animals in Group I were run in one trial per day and had food available to them each day on completion of the run (Figure 45.42).
7.45.782	Group II rats were not fed in the maze for the first six days and then subsequent runs were done with food for several days after.
7.45.783	Group III rats had food available on the third day and every day thereafter.
7.45.784	The results were that the control rats, Group I, learned quickly, and figured out how to run the maze in seven days.
7.45.785	Group III did not learn much during the three days without food, but rapidly caught up to the control group when given the food reward.
7.45.786	Group II learned very slowly for the six days with no reward to motivate them, and they did not begin to catch up to the control group until the day food was given, and then it took two days longer to learn the maze.
7.45.787	Group I (the green solid line) found food at the end of each trial, group II (the blue dashed line) did not find food for the first 6 days, and group III (the red dotted line) did not find food during runs on the first three days.
7.45.788	Notice that rats given food earlier learned faster and eventually caught up to the control group.
7.45.789	The orange dots on the group II and III lines show the days when food rewards were added to the mazes.
7.45.790	It may not be immediately obvious that this type of learning is different than conditioning.
7.45.791	Although one might be tempted to believe that the rats simply learned how to find their way through a conditioned series of right and left turns, E.C. Tolman proved a decade later that the rats were making a representation of the maze in their minds, which he called a “cognitive map.
7.45.792	”
7.45.793	This was an early demonstration of the power of cognitive learning and how these abilities were not just limited to humans.
7.45.794	Sociobiology Sociobiology is an interdisciplinary science originally popularized by social insect researcher E.O. Wilson in the 1970s.
7.45.795	Wilson defined the science as “the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization.
7.45.796	”
7.45.797	[10] The main thrust of sociobiology is that animal and human behavior, including aggressiveness and other social interactions, can be explained almost solely in terms of genetics and natural selection.
7.45.798	This science is controversial; noted scientist such as the late Stephen Jay Gould criticized the approach for ignoring the environmental effects on behavior.
7.45.799	This is another example of the “nature versus nurture” debate of the role of genetics versus the role of environment in determining an organism’s characteristics.
7.45.800	Sociobiology also links genes with behaviors and has been associated with “biological determinism,” the belief that all behaviors are hardwired into our genes.
7.45.801	No one disputes that certain behaviors can be inherited and that natural selection plays a role retaining them.
7.45.802	It is the application of such principles to human behavior that sparks this controversy, which remains active today.
7.46.0	In the southwestern United States, rainy weather causes an increase in production of pinyon nuts, causing the deer mouse population to explode.
7.46.1	Deer mice may carry a virus called Sin Nombre (a hantavirus) that causes respiratory disease in humans and has a high fatality rate.
7.46.2	In 1992–1993, wet El Niño weather caused a Sin Nombre epidemic.
7.46.3	Navajo healers, who were aware of the link between this disease and weather, predicted the outbreak.
7.46.4	In 1993, an interesting example of ecosystem dynamics occurred when a rare lung disease struck inhabitants of the southwestern United States.
7.46.5	This disease had an alarming rate of fatalities, killing more than half of early patients, many of whom were Native Americans.
7.46.6	These formerly healthy young adults died from complete respiratory failure.
7.46.7	The disease was unknown, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the United States government agency responsible for managing potential epidemics, was brought in to investigate.
7.46.8	The scientists could have learned about the disease had they known to talk with the Navajo healers who lived in the area and who had observed the connection between rainfall and mice populations, thereby predicting the 1993 outbreak.
7.46.9	The cause of the disease, determined within a few weeks by the CDC investigators, was the hantavirus known as Sin Nombre, the virus with “no name.
7.46.10	”
7.46.11	With insights from traditional Navajo medicine, scientists were able to characterize the disease rapidly and institute effective health measures to prevent its spread.
7.46.12	This example illustrates the importance of understanding the complexities of ecosystems and how they respond to changes in the environment.
7.46.13	Ecology of Ecosystems
7.46.14	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the basic types of ecosystems on
7.46.15	Earth Explain
7.46.16	the methods that ecologists use to study ecosystem structure and dynamics Identify the different methods of ecosystem modeling Differentiate between food chains and food webs and recognize the importance of each Life in an ecosystem is often about competition for limited resources, a characteristic of the theory of natural selection.
7.46.17	Competition in communities (all living things within specific habitats) is observed both within species and among different species.
7.46.18	The resources for which organisms compete include organic material from living or previously living organisms, sunlight, and mineral nutrients, which provide the energy for living processes and the matter to make up organisms’ physical structures.
7.46.19	Other critical factors influencing community dynamics are the components of its physical and geographic environment: a habitat’s latitude, amount of rainfall, topography (elevation), and available species.
7.46.20	These are all important environmental variables that determine which organisms can exist within a particular area.
7.46.21	An ecosystem is a community of living organisms and their interactions with their abiotic (non-living) environment.
7.46.22	Ecosystems can be small, such as the tide pools found near the rocky shores of many oceans, or large, such as the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil.
7.46.23	A (a) tidal pool ecosystem in Matinicus Island in Maine is a small ecosystem, while the (b) Amazon Rainforest in Brazil is a large ecosystem.
7.46.24	There are three broad categories of ecosystems based on their general environment: freshwater, ocean water, and terrestrial.
7.46.25	Within these broad categories are individual ecosystem types based on the organisms present and the type of environmental habitat.
7.46.26	Ocean ecosystems are the most common, comprising 75 percent of the Earth's surface and consisting of three basic types: shallow ocean, deep ocean water, and deep ocean surfaces (the low depth areas of the deep oceans).
7.46.27	The shallow ocean ecosystems include extremely biodiverse coral reef ecosystems, and the deep ocean surface is known for its large numbers of plankton and krill (small crustaceans) that support it.
7.46.28	These two environments are especially important to aerobic respirators worldwide as the phytoplankton perform 40 percent of all photosynthesis on Earth.
7.46.29	Although not as diverse as the other two, deep ocean ecosystems contain a wide variety of marine organisms.
7.46.30	Such ecosystems exist even at the bottom of the ocean where light is unable to penetrate through the water.
7.46.31	Freshwater ecosystems are the rarest, occurring on only 1.8 percent of the Earth's surface.
7.46.32	Lakes, rivers, streams, and springs comprise these systems; they are quite diverse, and they support a variety of fish, amphibians, reptiles, insects, phytoplankton, fungi, and bacteria.
7.46.33	Terrestrial ecosystems, also known for their diversity, are grouped into large categories called biomes, such as tropical rain forests, savannas, deserts, coniferous forests, deciduous forests, and tundra.
7.46.34	Grouping these ecosystems into just a few biome categories obscures the great diversity of the individual ecosystems within them.
7.46.35	For example, there is great variation in desert vegetation: the saguaro cacti and other plant life in the Sonoran Desert, in the United States, are relatively abundant compared to the desolate rocky desert of Boa Vista, an island off the coast of Western Africa.
7.46.36	Desert ecosystems, like all ecosystems, can vary greatly.
7.46.37	The desert in (a)
7.46.38	Saguaro National Park, Arizona, has abundant plant life, while the rocky desert of (b) Boa Vista island, Cape Verde, Africa, is devoid of plant life.
7.46.39	Ecosystems are complex with many interacting parts.
7.46.40	They are routinely exposed to various disturbances, or changes in the environment that effect their compositions: yearly variations in rainfall and temperature and the slower processes of plant growth, which may take several years.
7.46.41	Many of these disturbances are a result of natural processes.
7.46.42	For example, when lightning causes a forest fire and destroys part of a forest ecosystem, the ground is eventually populated by grasses, then by bushes and shrubs, and later by mature trees, restoring the forest to its former state.
7.46.43	The impact of environmental disturbances caused by human activities is as important as the changes wrought by natural processes.
7.46.44	Human agricultural practices, air pollution, acid rain, global deforestation, overfishing, eutrophication, oil spills, and illegal dumping on land and into the ocean are all issues of concern to conservationists.
7.46.45	Equilibrium is the steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment and with each other.
7.46.46	In ecology, two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems: resistance and resilience.
7.46.47	The ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance.
7.46.48	The speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed, called its resilience.
7.46.49	Ecosystem resistance and resilience are especially important when considering human impact.
7.46.50	The nature of an ecosystem may change to such a degree that it can lose its resilience entirely.
7.46.51	This process can lead to the complete destruction or irreversible altering of the ecosystem.
7.46.52	Food Chains and Food Webs
7.46.53	The term “food chain” is sometimes used metaphorically to describe human social situations.
7.46.54	In this sense, food chains are thought of as a competition for survival, such as “who eats whom?
7.46.55	”
7.46.56	Someone eats and someone is eaten.
7.46.57	Therefore, it is not surprising that in our competitive “dog-eat-dog” society, individuals who are considered successful are seen as being at the top of the food chain, consuming all others for their benefit, whereas the less successful are seen as being at the bottom.
7.46.58	The scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage.
7.46.59	In ecology, a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass: primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics.
7.46.60	There is a single path through the chain.
7.46.61	Each organism in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level.
7.46.62	Depending on their role as producers or consumers, species or groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels.
7.46.63	In many ecosystems, the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms (plants and/or phytoplankton), which are called primary producers.
7.46.64	The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores: the primary consumers.
7.46.65	Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers.
7.46.66	Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores.
7.46.67	Higher-level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels, and so on, up to the organisms at the top of the food chain: the apex consumers.
7.46.68	In the Lake Ontario food chain shown in Figure 46.4, the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain.
7.46.69	These are the trophic levels of a food chain in Lake Ontario at the United States-Canada border.
7.46.70	Energy and nutrients flow from photosynthetic green algae at the bottom to the top of the food chain: the Chinook salmon.
7.46.71	One major factor that limits the length of food chains is energy.
7.46.72	Energy is lost as heat between each trophic level due to the second law of thermodynamics.
7.46.73	Thus, after a limited number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy remaining in the food chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher trophic level.
7.46.74	The loss of energy between trophic levels is illustrated by the pioneering studies of Howard T. Odum in the Silver Springs, Florida, ecosystem in the 1940s (Figure 46.5).
7.46.75	The primary producers generated 20,819 kcal/m2/yr (kilocalories per square meter per year), the primary consumers generated 3368 kcal/m2/yr, the secondary consumers generated 383 kcal/m2/yr, and the tertiary consumers only generated 21 kcal/m2/yr.
7.46.76	Thus, there is little energy remaining for another level of consumers in this ecosystem.
7.46.77	The relative energy in trophic levels in a Silver Springs, Florida, ecosystem is shown.
7.46.78	Each trophic level has less energy available and supports fewer organisms at the next level.
7.46.79	There is a one problem when using food chains to accurately describe most ecosystems.
7.46.80	Even when all organisms are grouped into appropriate trophic levels, some of these organisms can feed on species from more than one trophic level; likewise, some of these organisms can be eaten by species from multiple trophic levels.
7.46.81	In other words, the linear model of ecosystems, the food chain, is not completely descriptive of ecosystem structure.
7.46.82	A holistic model—which accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment—is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems.
7.46.83	A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic, non-linear web of primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics.
7.46.84	This food web shows the interactions between organisms across trophic levels in the Lake Ontario ecosystem.
7.46.85	Primary producers are outlined in green, primary consumers in orange, secondary consumers in blue, and tertiary (apex) consumers in purple.
7.46.86	Arrows point from an organism that is consumed to the organism that consumes it.
7.46.87	Notice how some lines point to more than one trophic level.
7.46.88	For example, the opossum shrimp eats both primary producers and primary consumers.
7.46.89	A comparison of the two types of structural ecosystem models shows strength in both.
7.46.90	Food chains are more flexible for analytical modeling, are easier to follow, and are easier to experiment with, whereas food web models more accurately represent ecosystem structure and dynamics, and data can be directly used as input for simulation modeling.
7.46.91	Two general types of food webs are often shown interacting within a single ecosystem.
7.46.92	A grazing food web (such as the Lake Ontario food web in Figure 46.6) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base, followed by herbivores and various carnivores.
7.46.93	A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter (dead organisms), called decomposers or detritivores.
7.46.94	These organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms.
7.46.95	As all ecosystems require a method to recycle material from dead organisms, most grazing food webs have an associated detrital food web.
7.46.96	For example, in a meadow ecosystem, plants may support a grazing food web of different organisms, primary and other levels of consumers, while at the same time supporting a detrital food web of bacteria, fungi, and detrivorous invertebrates feeding off dead plants and animals.
7.46.97	Research into Ecosystem Dynamics: Ecosystem Experimentation and Modeling
7.46.98	The study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment (disturbances) or by internal forces is called ecosystem dynamics.
7.46.99	Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies.
7.46.100	Some ecologists study ecosystems using controlled experimental systems, while some study entire ecosystems in their natural state, and others use both approaches.
7.46.101	A holistic ecosystem model attempts to quantify the composition, interaction, and dynamics of entire ecosystems; it is the most representative of the ecosystem in its natural state.
7.46.102	A food web is an example of a holistic ecosystem model.
7.46.103	However, this type of study is limited by time and expense, as well as the fact that it is neither feasible nor ethical to do experiments on large natural ecosystems.
7.46.104	To quantify all different species in an ecosystem and the dynamics in their habitat is difficult, especially when studying large habitats such as the Amazon Rainforest, which covers 1.4 billion acres (5.5 million km2) of the Earth’s surface.
7.46.105	For these reasons, scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions.
7.46.106	Experimental systems usually involve either partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments, termed a mesocosm, or by re-creating an ecosystem entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment, which is referred to as a microcosm.
7.46.107	A major limitation to these approaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through partitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem.
7.46.108	These changes are often due to differences in species numbers and diversity and also to environment alterations caused by partitioning (mesocosm) or re-creating (microcosm) the natural habitat.
7.46.109	Thus, these types of experiments are not totally predictive of changes that would occur in the ecosystem from which they were gathered.
7.46.110	As both of these approaches have their limitations, some ecologists suggest that results from these experimental systems should be used only in conjunction with holistic ecosystem studies to obtain the most representative data about ecosystem structure, function, and dynamics.
7.46.111	Scientists use the data generated by these experimental studies to develop ecosystem models that demonstrate the structure and dynamics of ecosystems.
7.46.112	Three basic types of ecosystem modeling are routinely used in research and ecosystem management: a conceptual model, an analytical model, and a simulation model.
7.46.113	A conceptual model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem.
7.46.114	A conceptual model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem; however, its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited.
7.46.115	Analytical and simulation models, in contrast, are mathematical methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects of potential environmental changes without direct experimentation, although with some limitations as to accuracy.
7.46.116	An analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics.
7.46.117	A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics.
7.46.118	Ideally, these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances, and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers (such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health.
7.46.119	Conceptual Models Conceptual models are useful for describing ecosystem structure and dynamics and for demonstrating the relationships between different organisms in a community and their environment.
7.46.120	Conceptual models are usually depicted graphically as flow charts.
7.46.121	The organisms and their resources are grouped into specific compartments with arrows showing the relationship and transfer of energy or nutrients between them.
7.46.122	Thus, these diagrams are sometimes called compartment models.
7.46.123	To model the cycling of mineral nutrients, organic and inorganic nutrients are subdivided into those that are bioavailable (ready to be incorporated into biological macromolecules) and those that are not.
7.46.124	For example, in a terrestrial ecosystem near a deposit of coal, carbon will be available to the plants of this ecosystem as carbon dioxide gas in a short-term period, not from the carbon-rich coal itself.
7.46.125	However, over a longer period, microorganisms capable of digesting coal will incorporate its carbon or release it as natural gas (methane, CH4), changing this unavailable organic source into an available one.
7.46.126	This conversion is greatly accelerated by the combustion of fossil fuels by humans, which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
7.46.127	This is thought to be a major factor in the rise of the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the industrial age.
7.46.128	The carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels is produced faster than photosynthetic organisms can use it.
7.46.129	This process is intensified by the reduction of photosynthetic trees because of worldwide deforestation.
7.46.130	Most scientists agree that high atmospheric carbon dioxide is a major cause of global climate change.
7.46.131	Conceptual models are also used to show the flow of energy through particular ecosystems.
7.46.132	Figure 46.8 is based on Howard T. Odum’s classical study of the Silver Springs, Florida, holistic ecosystem in the mid-twentieth century.
7.46.133	[2] This study shows the energy content and transfer between various ecosystem compartments.
7.46.134	Analytical and Simulation Models
7.46.135	The major limitation of conceptual models is their inability to predict the consequences of changes in ecosystem species and/or environment.
7.46.136	Ecosystems are dynamic entities and subject to a variety of abiotic and biotic disturbances caused by natural forces and/or human activity.
7.46.137	Ecosystems altered from their initial equilibrium state can often recover from such disturbances and return to a state of equilibrium.
7.46.138	As most ecosystems are subject to periodic disturbances and are often in a state of change, they are usually either moving toward or away from their equilibrium state.
7.46.139	There are many of these equilibrium states among the various components of an ecosystem, which affects the ecosystem overall.
7.46.140	Furthermore, as humans have the ability to greatly and rapidly alter the species content and habitat of an ecosystem, the need for predictive models that enable understanding of how ecosystems respond to these changes becomes more crucial.
7.46.141	Analytical models often use simple, linear components of ecosystems, such as food chains, and are known to be complex mathematically; therefore, they require a significant amount of mathematical knowledge and expertise.
7.46.142	Although analytical models have great potential, their simplification of complex ecosystems is thought to limit their accuracy.
7.46.143	Simulation models that use computer programs are better able to deal with the complexities of ecosystem structure.
7.46.144	A recent development in simulation modeling uses supercomputers to create and run individual-based simulations, which accounts for the behavior of individual organisms and their effects on the ecosystem as a whole.
7.46.145	These simulations are considered to be the most accurate and predictive of the complex responses of ecosystems to disturbances.
7.46.146	Energy Flow through Ecosystems
7.46.147	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe how organisms acquire energy in a food web and in associated food chains Explain how the efficiency of energy transfers between trophic levels affects ecosystem structure and dynamics Discuss trophic levels and how ecological pyramids are used to model them All living things require energy in one form or another.
7.46.148	Energy is required by most complex metabolic pathways (often in the form of adenosine triphosphate, ATP), especially those responsible for building large molecules from smaller compounds, and life itself is an energy-driven process.
7.46.149	Living organisms would not be able to assemble macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and complex carbohydrates) from their monomeric subunits without a constant energy input.
7.46.150	It is important to understand how organisms acquire energy and how that energy is passed from one organism to another through food webs and their constituent food chains.
7.46.151	Food webs illustrate how energy flows directionally through ecosystems, including how efficiently organisms acquire it, use it, and how much remains for use by other organisms of the food web.
7.46.152	How Organisms Acquire Energy in a Food Web Energy is acquired by living things in three ways: photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, and the consumption and digestion of other living or previously living organisms by heterotrophs.
7.46.153	Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are both grouped into a category known as autotrophs: organisms capable of synthesizing their own food (more specifically, capable of using inorganic carbon as a carbon source).
7.46.154	Photosynthetic autotrophs (photoautotrophs) use sunlight as an energy source, whereas chemosynthetic autotrophs (chemoautotrophs) use inorganic molecules as an energy source.
7.46.155	Autotrophs are critical for all ecosystems.
7.46.156	Without these organisms, energy would not be available to other living organisms and life itself would not be possible.
7.46.157	Photoautotrophs, such as plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, serve as the energy source for a majority of the world’s ecosystems.
7.46.158	These ecosystems are often described by grazing food webs.
7.46.159	Photoautotrophs harness the solar energy of the sun by converting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP (and NADP).
7.46.160	The energy stored in ATP is used to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose.
7.46.161	Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as in those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean (Figure 46.9).
7.46.162	Many chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy.
7.46.163	This allows chemoautotrophs to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose, for their own energy and in turn supplies energy to the rest of the ecosystem.
7.46.164	Swimming shrimp, a few squat lobsters, and hundreds of vent mussels are seen at a hydrothermal vent at the bottom of the ocean.
7.46.165	As no sunlight penetrates to this depth, the ecosystem is supported by chemoautotrophic bacteria and organic material that sinks from the ocean’s surface.
7.46.166	This picture was taken in 2006 at the submerged NW Eifuku volcano off the coast of Japan by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
7.46.167	The summit of this highly active volcano lies 1535 m below the surface.
7.46.168	Productivity within Trophic Levels Productivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into biomass in a particular trophic level.
7.46.169	Biomass is the total mass, in a unit area at the time of measurement, of living or previously living organisms within a trophic level.
7.46.170	Ecosystems have characteristic amounts of biomass at each trophic level.
7.46.171	For example, in the English Channel ecosystem the primary producers account for a biomass of 4 g/m2 (grams per meter squared), while the primary consumers exhibit a biomass of 21 g/m2.
7.46.172	The productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms bring energy to other living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy.
7.46.173	The rate at which photosynthetic primary producers incorporate energy from the sun is called gross primary productivity.
7.46.174	An example of gross primary productivity is shown in the compartment diagram of energy flow within the Silver Springs aquatic ecosystem as shown (Figure 46.8).
7.46.175	In this ecosystem, the total energy accumulated by the primary producers (gross primary productivity) was shown to be 20,810 kcal/m2/yr.
7.46.176	Because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions (like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss) scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem.
7.46.177	Net primary productivity is the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms’ respiration and heat loss.
7.46.178	The net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level.
7.46.179	In our Silver Spring example, 13,187 of the 20,810 kcal/m2/yr were used for respiration or were lost as heat, leaving 7,632 kcal/m2/yr of energy for use by the primary consumers.
7.46.180	Ecological Efficiency: The Transfer of Energy between Trophic Levels
7.46.181	As illustrated in Figure 46.8, large amounts of energy are lost from the ecosystem from one trophic level to the next level as energy flows from the primary producers through the various trophic levels of consumers and decomposers.
7.46.182	The main reason for this loss is the second law of thermodynamics, which states that whenever energy is converted from one form to another, there is a tendency toward disorder (entropy) in the system.
7.46.183	In biologic systems, this means a great deal of energy is lost as metabolic heat when the organisms from one trophic level consume the next level.
7.46.184	In the Silver Springs ecosystem example (Figure 46.8), we see that the primary consumers produced 1103 kcal/m2/yr from the 7618 kcal/m2/yr of energy available to them from the primary producers.
7.46.185	The measurement of energy transfer efficiency between two successive trophic levels is termed the trophic level transfer efficiency (TLTE) and is defined by the formula: In Silver Springs, the TLTE between the first two trophic levels was approximately 14.8 percent.
7.46.186	The low efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels is usually the major factor that limits the length of food chains observed in a food web.
7.46.187	The fact is, after four to six energy transfers, there is not enough energy left to support another trophic level.
7.46.188	In the Lake Ontario example shown in Figure 46.6, only three energy transfers occurred between the primary producer, (green algae), and the apex consumer (Chinook salmon).
7.46.189	Ecologists have many different methods of measuring energy transfers within ecosystems.
7.46.190	Some transfers are easier or more difficult to measure depending on the complexity of the ecosystem and how much access scientists have to observe the ecosystem.
7.46.191	In other words, some ecosystems are more difficult to study than others, and sometimes the quantification of energy transfers has to be estimated.
7.46.192	Another main parameter that is important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem is the net production efficiency.
7.46.193	Net production efficiency (NPE) allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level incorporate the energy they receive into biomass; it is calculated using the following formula: Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level.
7.46.194	Assimilation is the biomass (energy content generated per unit area) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food, energy used for respiration, and energy lost as waste.
7.46.195	Incomplete ingestion refers to the fact that some consumers eat only a part of their food.
7.46.196	For example, when a lion kills an antelope, it will eat everything except the hide and bones.
7.46.197	The lion is missing the energy-rich bone marrow inside the bone, so the lion does not make use of all the calories its prey could provide.
7.46.198	Thus, NPE measures how efficiently each trophic level uses and incorporates the energy from its food into biomass to fuel the next trophic level.
7.46.199	In general, cold-blooded animals (ectotherms), such as invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles, use less of the energy they obtain for respiration and heat than warm-blooded animals (endotherms), such as birds and mammals.
7.46.200	The extra heat generated in endotherms, although an advantage in terms of the activity of these organisms in colder environments, is a major disadvantage in terms of NPE.
7.46.201	Therefore, many endotherms have to eat more often than ectotherms to get the energy they need for survival.
7.46.202	In general, NPE for ectotherms is an order of magnitude (10x) higher than for endotherms.
7.46.203	For example, the NPE for a caterpillar eating leaves has been measured at 18 percent, whereas the NPE for a squirrel eating acorns may be as low as 1.6 percent.
7.46.204	The inefficiency of energy use by warm-blooded animals has broad implications for the world's food supply.
7.46.205	It is widely accepted that the meat industry uses large amounts of crops to feed livestock, and because the NPE is low, much of the energy from animal feed is lost.
7.46.206	For example, it costs about 1¢ to produce 1000 dietary calories (kcal) of corn or soybeans, but approximately $0.19 to produce a similar number of calories growing cattle for beef consumption.
7.46.207	The same energy content of milk from cattle is also costly, at approximately $0.16 per 1000 kcal.
7.46.208	Much of this difference is due to the low NPE of cattle.
7.46.209	Thus, there has been a growing movement worldwide to promote the consumption of non-meat and non-dairy foods so that less energy is wasted feeding animals for the meat industry.
7.46.210	Modeling Ecosystems Energy Flow:
7.46.211	Ecological Pyramids
7.46.212	The structure of ecosystems can be visualized with ecological pyramids, which were first described by the pioneering studies of Charles Elton in the 1920s.
7.46.213	Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of various parameters (such as number of organisms, energy, and biomass) across trophic levels.
7.46.214	Pyramids of numbers can be either upright or inverted, depending on the ecosystem.
7.46.215	As shown in Figure 46.10, typical grassland during the summer has a base of many plants and the numbers of organisms decrease at each trophic level.
7.46.216	However, during the summer in a temperate forest, the base of the pyramid consists of few trees compared with the number of primary consumers, mostly insects.
7.46.217	Because trees are large, they have great photosynthetic capability, and dominate other plants in this ecosystem to obtain sunlight.
7.46.218	Even in smaller numbers, primary producers in forests are still capable of supporting other trophic levels.
7.46.219	Another way to visualize ecosystem structure is with pyramids of biomass.
7.46.220	This pyramid measures the amount of energy converted into living tissue at the different trophic levels.
7.46.221	Using the Silver Springs ecosystem example, this data exhibits an upright biomass pyramid (Figure 46.10), whereas the pyramid from the English Channel example is inverted.
7.46.222	The plants (primary producers) of the Silver Springs ecosystem make up a large percentage of the biomass found there.
7.46.223	However, the phytoplankton in the English Channel example make up less biomass than the primary consumers, the zooplankton.
7.46.224	As with inverted pyramids of numbers, this inverted pyramid is not due to a lack of productivity from the primary producers, but results from the high turnover rate of the phytoplankton.
7.46.225	The phytoplankton are consumed rapidly by the primary consumers, thus, minimizing their biomass at any particular point in time.
7.46.226	However, phytoplankton reproduce quickly, thus they are able to support the rest of the ecosystem.
7.46.227	Pyramid ecosystem modeling can also be used to show energy flow through the trophic levels.
7.46.228	Notice that these numbers are the same as those used in the energy flow compartment diagram in Figure 46.8.
7.46.229	Pyramids of energy are always upright, and an ecosystem without sufficient primary productivity cannot be supported.
7.46.230	All types of ecological pyramids are useful for characterizing ecosystem structure.
7.46.231	However, in the study of energy flow through the ecosystem, pyramids of energy are the most consistent and representative models of ecosystem structure.
7.46.232	Consequences of Food Webs:
7.46.233	Biological Magnification One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification.
7.46.234	Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent, toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level, from the primary producers to the apex consumers.
7.46.235	Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate, including classical studies with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which was published in the 1960s bestseller, Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson.
7.46.236	DDT was a commonly used pesticide before its dangers became known.
7.46.237	In some aquatic ecosystems, organisms from each trophic level consumed many organisms of the lower level, which caused DDT to increase in birds (apex consumers) that ate fish.
7.46.238	Thus, the birds accumulated sufficient amounts of DDT to cause fragility in their eggshells.
7.46.239	This effect increased egg breakage during nesting and was shown to have adverse effects on these bird populations.
7.46.240	The use of DDT was banned in the United States in the 1970s.
7.46.241	Other substances that biomagnify are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were used in coolant liquids in the United States until their use was banned in 1979, and heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium.
7.46.242	These substances were best studied in aquatic ecosystems, where fish species at different trophic levels accumulate toxic substances brought through the ecosystem by the primary producers.
7.46.243	As illustrated in a study performed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron (Figure 46.11), PCB concentrations increased from the ecosystem’s primary producers (phytoplankton) through the different trophic levels of fish species.
7.46.244	The apex consumer (walleye) has more than four times the amount of PCBs compared to phytoplankton.
7.46.245	Also, based on results from other studies, birds that eat these fish may have PCB levels at least one order of magnitude higher than those found in the lake fish.
7.46.246	This chart shows the PCB concentrations found at the various trophic levels in the Saginaw Bay ecosystem of Lake Huron.
7.46.247	Numbers on the x-axis reflect enrichment with heavy isotopes of nitrogen (15N), which is a marker for increasing trophic level.
7.46.248	Notice that the fish in the higher trophic levels accumulate more PCBs than those in lower trophic levels.
7.46.249	Other concerns have been raised by the accumulation of heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium, in certain types of seafood.
7.46.250	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that pregnant women and young children should not consume any swordfish, shark, king mackerel, or tilefish because of their high mercury content.
7.46.251	These individuals are advised to eat fish low in mercury: salmon, tilapia, shrimp, pollock, and catfish.
7.46.252	Biomagnification is a good example of how ecosystem dynamics can affect our everyday lives, even influencing the food we eat.
7.46.253	Biogeochemical Cycles
7.46.254	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Discuss the biogeochemical cycles of water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur Explain how human activities have impacted these cycles and the potential consequences for Earth Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight (or inorganic molecules for chemoautotrophs) and leaving as heat during the many transfers between trophic levels.
7.46.255	However, the matter that makes up living organisms is conserved and recycled.
7.46.256	The six most common elements associated with organic molecules—carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath the Earth’s surface.
7.46.257	Geologic processes, such as weathering, erosion, water drainage, and the subduction of the continental plates, all play a role in this recycling of materials.
7.46.258	Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process, the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle.
7.46.259	Water contains hydrogen and oxygen, which is essential to all living processes.
7.46.260	The hydrosphere is the area of the Earth where water movement and storage occurs: as liquid water on the surface and beneath the surface or frozen (rivers, lakes, oceans, groundwater, polar ice caps, and glaciers), and as water vapor in the atmosphere.
7.46.261	Carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels.
7.46.262	Nitrogen is a major component of our nucleic acids and proteins and is critical to human agriculture.
7.46.263	Phosphorus, a major component of nucleic acid (along with nitrogen), is one of the main ingredients in artificial fertilizers used in agriculture and their associated environmental impacts on our surface water.
7.46.264	Sulfur, critical to the 3–D folding of proteins (as in disulfide binding), is released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal.
7.46.265	The cycling of these elements is interconnected.
7.46.266	For example, the movement of water is critical for the leaching of nitrogen and phosphate into rivers, lakes, and oceans.
7.46.267	Furthermore, the ocean itself is a major reservoir for carbon.
7.46.268	Thus, mineral nutrients are cycled, either rapidly or slowly, through the entire biosphere, from one living organism to another, and between the biotic and abiotic world.
7.46.269	The Water (Hydrologic) Cycle Water is the basis of all living processes.
7.46.270	The human body is more than 1/2 water and human cells are more than 70 percent water.
7.46.271	Thus, most land animals need a supply of fresh water to survive.
7.46.272	However, when examining the stores of water on Earth, 97.5 percent of it is non-potable salt water (Figure 46.12).
7.46.273	Of the remaining water, 99 percent is locked underground as water or as ice.
7.46.274	Thus, less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily accessible from lakes and rivers.
7.46.275	Many living things, such as plants, animals, and fungi, are dependent on the small amount of fresh surface water supply, a lack of which can have massive effects on ecosystem dynamics.
7.46.276	Humans, of course, have developed technologies to increase water availability, such as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using desalination to obtain drinkable water from the ocean.
7.46.277	Although this pursuit of drinkable water has been ongoing throughout human history, the supply of fresh water is still a major issue in modern times.
7.46.278	Only 2.5 percent of water on Earth is fresh water, and less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily accessible to living things.
7.46.279	Water cycling is extremely important to ecosystem dynamics.
7.46.280	Water has a major influence on climate and, thus, on the environments of ecosystems, some located on distant parts of the Earth.
7.46.281	Most of the water on Earth is stored for long periods in the oceans, underground, and as ice.
7.46.282	Figure 46.13 illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may spend in the Earth’s major water reservoirs.
7.46.283	Residence time is a measure of the average time an individual water molecule stays in a particular reservoir.
7.46.284	A large amount of the Earth’s water is locked in place in these reservoirs as ice, beneath the ground, and in the ocean, and, thus, is unavailable for short-term cycling (only surface water can evaporate).
7.46.285	This graph shows the average residence time for water molecules in the Earth’s water reservoirs.
7.46.286	There are various processes that occur during the cycling of water, shown in Figure 46.14.
7.46.287	These processes include the following: • evaporation/sublimation • condensation/precipitation • subsurface water flow • surface runoff/snowmelt
7.46.288	• streamflow
7.46.289	The water cycle is driven by the sun’s energy as it warms the oceans and other surface waters.
7.46.290	This leads to the evaporation (water to water vapor) of liquid surface water and the sublimation (ice to water vapor) of frozen water, which deposits large amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere.
7.46.291	Over time, this water vapor condenses into clouds as liquid or frozen droplets and is eventually followed by precipitation (rain or snow), which returns water to the Earth’s surface.
7.46.292	Rain eventually permeates into the ground, where it may evaporate again if it is near the surface, flow beneath the surface, or be stored for long periods.
7.46.293	More easily observed is surface runoff: the flow of fresh water either from rain or melting ice.
7.46.294	Runoff can then make its way through streams and lakes to the oceans or flow directly to the oceans themselves.
7.46.295	Rain and surface runoff are major ways in which minerals, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, are cycled from land to water.
7.46.296	The environmental effects of runoff will be discussed later as these cycles are described.
7.46.297	Water from the land and oceans enters the atmosphere by evaporation or sublimation, where it condenses into clouds and falls as rain or snow.
7.46.298	Precipitated water may enter freshwater bodies or infiltrate the soil.
7.46.299	The cycle is complete when surface or groundwater reenters the ocean.
7.46.300	The Carbon Cycle Carbon is the second most abundant element in living organisms.
7.46.301	Carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role in the structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms.
7.46.302	Carbon compounds contain especially high energy, particularly those derived from fossilized organisms, mainly plants, which humans use as fuel.
7.46.303	Since the 1800s, the number of countries using massive amounts of fossil fuels has increased.
7.46.304	Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, global demand for the Earth’s limited fossil fuel supplies has risen; therefore, the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased.
7.46.305	This increase in carbon dioxide has been associated with climate change and other disturbances of the Earth’s ecosystems and is a major environmental concern worldwide.
7.46.306	Thus, the “carbon footprint” is based on how much carbon dioxide is produced and how much fossil fuel countries consume.
7.46.307	The carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected sub-cycles: one dealing with rapid carbon exchange among living organisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon through geologic processes.
7.46.308	The entire carbon cycle is shown in Figure 46.15.
7.46.309	The Carbon Cycle Carbon is the second most abundant element in living organisms.
7.46.310	Carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role in the structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms.
7.46.311	Carbon compounds contain especially high energy, particularly those derived from fossilized organisms, mainly plants, which humans use as fuel.
7.46.312	Since the 1800s, the number of countries using massive amounts of fossil fuels has increased.
7.46.313	Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, global demand for the Earth’s limited fossil fuel supplies has risen; therefore, the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased.
7.46.314	This increase in carbon dioxide has been associated with climate change and other disturbances of the Earth’s ecosystems and is a major environmental concern worldwide.
7.46.315	Thus, the “carbon footprint” is based on how much carbon dioxide is produced and how much fossil fuel countries consume.
7.46.316	The carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected sub-cycles: one dealing with rapid carbon exchange among living organisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon through geologic processes.
7.46.317	The entire carbon cycle is shown in Figure 46.15.
7.46.318	The Biological Carbon Cycle Living organisms are connected in many ways, even between ecosystems.
7.46.319	A good example of this connection is the exchange of carbon between autotrophs and heterotrophs within and between ecosystems by way of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
7.46.320	Carbon dioxide is the basic building block that most autotrophs use to build multi-carbon, high energy compounds, such as glucose.
7.46.321	The energy harnessed from the sun is used by these organisms to form the covalent bonds that link carbon atoms together.
7.46.322	These chemical bonds thereby store this energy for later use in the process of respiration.
7.46.323	Most terrestrial autotrophs obtain their carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, while marine autotrophs acquire it in the dissolved form (carbonic acid, H2CO3 −).
7.46.324	However carbon dioxide is acquired, a by-product of the process is oxygen.
7.46.325	The photosynthetic organisms are responsible for depositing approximately 21 percent oxygen content of the atmosphere that we observe today.
7.46.326	Heterotrophs and autotrophs are partners in biological carbon exchange (especially the primary consumers, largely herbivores).
7.46.327	Heterotrophs acquire the high-energy carbon compounds from the autotrophs by consuming them, and breaking them down by respiration to obtain cellular energy, such as ATP.
7.46.328	The most efficient type of respiration, aerobic respiration, requires oxygen obtained from the atmosphere or dissolved in water.
7.46.329	Thus, there is a constant exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the autotrophs (which need the carbon) and the heterotrophs (which need the oxygen).
7.46.330	Gas exchange through the atmosphere and water is one way that the carbon cycle connects all living organisms on Earth.
7.46.331	The Biogeochemical Carbon Cycle
7.46.332	The movement of carbon through the land, water, and air is complex, and in many cases, it occurs much more slowly geologically than as seen between living organisms.
7.46.333	Carbon is stored for long periods in what are known as carbon reservoirs, which include the atmosphere, bodies of liquid water (mostly oceans), ocean sediment, soil, land sediments (including fossil fuels), and the Earth’s interior.
7.46.334	As stated, the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and is essential to the process of photosynthesis.
7.46.335	The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans.
7.46.336	The exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each location, and each one affects the other reciprocally.
7.46.337	Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and combines with water molecules to form carbonic acid, and then it ionizes to carbonate and bicarbonate ions.
7.46.338	Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form bicarbonate and carbonate ions.
7.46.339	The equilibrium coefficients are such that more than 90 percent of the carbon in the ocean is found as bicarbonate ions.
7.46.340	Some of these ions combine with seawater calcium to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a major component of marine organism shells.
7.46.341	These organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor.
7.46.342	Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone, which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth.
7.46.343	On land, carbon is stored in soil as a result of the decomposition of living organisms (by decomposers) or from weathering of terrestrial rock and minerals.
7.46.344	This carbon can be leached into the water reservoirs by surface runoff.
7.46.345	Deeper underground, on land and at sea, are fossil fuels: the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form.
7.46.346	Fossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation.
7.46.347	A non-renewable resource, such as fossil fuel, is either regenerated very slowly or not at all.
7.46.348	Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land (including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems.
7.46.349	Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within the Earth by the process of subduction: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another.
7.46.350	Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents.
7.46.351	Carbon dioxide is also added to the atmosphere by the animal husbandry practices of humans.
7.46.352	The large numbers of land animals raised to feed the Earth’s growing population results in increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere due to farming practices and the respiration and methane production.
7.46.353	This is another example of how human activity indirectly affects biogeochemical cycles in a significant way.
7.46.354	Although much of the debate about the future effects of increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on fossils fuels, scientists take natural processes, such as volcanoes and respiration, into account as they model and predict the future impact of this increase.
7.46.355	The Nitrogen Cycle Getting nitrogen into the living world is difficult.
7.46.356	Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate nitrogen from the atmosphere (which exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N2) even though this molecule comprises approximately 78 percent of the atmosphere.
7.46.357	Nitrogen enters the living world via free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules through nitrogen fixation (conversion of N2).
7.46.358	Cyanobacteria live in most aquatic ecosystems where sunlight is present; they play a key role in nitrogen fixation.
7.46.359	Cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic sources of nitrogen to “fix” nitrogen.
7.46.360	Rhizobium bacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, beans, and peanuts) and provide them with the organic nitrogen they need.
7.46.361	Free-living bacteria, such as Azotobacter, are also important nitrogen fixers.
7.46.362	Organic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as primary production and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen.
7.46.363	As shown in Figure 46.17, the nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is successively converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by bacteria.
7.46.364	This process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification.
7.46.365	First, the ammonification process converts nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead animals into ammonium (NH4 +) by certain bacteria and fungi.
7.46.366	Second, the ammonium is converted to nitrites (NO2 −) by nitrifying bacteria, such as Nitrosomonas, through nitrification.
7.46.367	Subsequently, nitrites are converted to nitrates (NO3 −) by similar organisms.
7.46.368	Third, the process of denitrification occurs, whereby bacteria, such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium, convert the nitrates into nitrogen gas, allowing it to re-enter the atmosphere.
7.46.369	Human activity can release nitrogen into the environment by two primary means: the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases different nitrogen oxides, and by the use of artificial fertilizers in agriculture, which are then washed into lakes, streams, and rivers by surface runoff.
7.46.370	Atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on Earth’s ecosystems including the production of acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO3) and greenhouse gas (as nitrous oxide, N2O) potentially causing climate change.
7.46.371	A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication, a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms, depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna.
7.46.372	A similar process occurs in the marine nitrogen cycle, where the ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification processes are performed by marine bacteria.
7.46.373	Some of this nitrogen falls to the ocean floor as sediment, which can then be moved to land in geologic time by uplift of the Earth’s surface and thereby incorporated into terrestrial rock.
7.46.374	Although the movement of nitrogen from rock directly into living systems has been traditionally seen as insignificant compared with nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere, a recent study showed that this process may indeed be significant and should be included in any study of the global nitrogen cycle.
7.46.375	The Phosphorus Cycle Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes; it is a major component of nucleic acid and phospholipids, and, as calcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones.
7.46.376	Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for growth) in aquatic ecosystems (Figure 46.18).
7.46.377	Phosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO4 3−).
7.46.378	In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity, natural surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates into rivers, lakes, and the ocean.
7.46.379	This rock has its origins in the ocean.
7.46.380	Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions.
7.46.381	However, in remote regions, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust may also be significant phosphate sources.
7.46.382	This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of areas of the Earth’s surface.
7.46.383	Phosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine ecosystems.
7.46.384	The movement of phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow, with the average phosphate ion having an oceanic residence time between 20,000 and 100,000 years.
7.46.385	In nature, phosphorus exists as the phosphate ion (PO4 3−).
7.46.386	Weathering of rocks and volcanic activity releases phosphate into the soil, water, and air, where it becomes available to terrestrial food webs.
7.46.387	Phosphate enters the oceans via surface runoff, groundwater flow, and river flow.
7.46.388	Phosphate dissolved in ocean water cycles into marine food webs.
7.46.389	Some phosphate from the marine food webs falls to the ocean floor, where it forms sediment.
7.46.390	Excess phosphorus and nitrogen that enters these ecosystems from fertilizer runoff and from sewage causes excessive growth of microorganisms and depletes the dissolved oxygen, which leads to the death of many ecosystem fauna, such as shellfish and finfish.
7.46.391	This process is responsible for dead zones in lakes and at the mouths of many major rivers.
7.46.392	Dead zones occur when phosphorus and nitrogen from fertilizers cause excessive growth of microorganisms, which depletes oxygen and kills fauna.
7.46.393	Worldwide, large dead zones are found in coastal areas of high population density.
7.46.394	A dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are depleted of their normal flora and fauna; these zones can be caused by eutrophication, oil spills, dumping of toxic chemicals, and other human activities.
7.46.395	The number of dead zones has been increasing for several years, and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008.
7.46.396	One of the worst dead zones is off the coast of the United States in the Gulf of Mexico, where fertilizer runoff from the Mississippi River basin has created a dead zone of over 8463 square miles.
7.46.397	Phosphate and nitrate runoff from fertilizers also negatively affect several lake and bay ecosystems including the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.
7.46.398	The Sulfur Cycle Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living things.
7.46.399	As a part of the amino acid cysteine, it is involved in the formation of disulfide bonds within proteins, which help to determine their 3-D folding patterns, and hence their functions.
7.46.400	As shown in Figure 46.20, sulfur cycles between the oceans, land, and atmosphere.
7.46.401	Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and enters the atmosphere in three ways: from the decomposition of organic molecules, from volcanic activity and geothermal vents, and from the burning of fossil fuels by humans.
7.46.402	Sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere becomes available to terrestrial and marine ecosystems when it is dissolved in precipitation as weak sulfuric acid or when it falls directly to the Earth as fallout.
7.46.403	Weathering of rocks also makes sulfates available to terrestrial ecosystems.
7.46.404	Decomposition of living organisms returns sulfates to the ocean, soil and atmosphere.
7.46.405	On land, sulfur is deposited in four major ways: precipitation, direct fallout from the atmosphere, rock weathering, and geothermal vents (Figure 46.21).
7.46.406	Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and as rain falls through the atmosphere, sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
7.46.407	Sulfur can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout.
7.46.408	Also, the weathering of sulfur-containing rocks releases sulfur into the soil.
7.46.409	These rocks originate from ocean sediments that are moved to land by the geologic uplifting of ocean sediments.
7.46.410	Terrestrial ecosystems can then make use of these soil sulfates ( SO4− ), and upon the death and decomposition of these organisms, release the sulfur back into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas.
7.46.411	At this sulfur vent in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northeastern California, the yellowish sulfur deposits are visible near the mouth of the vent.
7.46.412	Sulfur enters the ocean via runoff from land, from atmospheric fallout, and from underwater geothermal vents.
7.46.413	Some ecosystems (Figure 46.9) rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source.
7.46.414	This sulfur then supports marine ecosystems in the form of sulfates.
7.46.415	Human activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle.
7.46.416	The burning of large quantities of fossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere.
7.46.417	As rain falls through this gas, it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain.
7.46.418	Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid, which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems.
7.46.419	Acid rain damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes, which kills many of the resident fauna; it also affects the man-made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings.
7.46.420	For example, many marble monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, have suffered significant damage from acid rain over the years.
7.46.421	These examples show the wide-ranging effects of human activities on our environment and the challenges that remain for our future.
7.47.0	Lake Victoria in Africa, shown in this satellite image, was the site of one of the most extraordinary evolutionary findings on the planet, as well as a casualty of devastating biodiversity loss.
7.47.1	In the 1980s, biologists working in Lake Victoria in Africa discovered one of the most extraordinary products of evolution on the planet.
7.47.2	Located in the Great Rift Valley, Lake Victoria is a large lake about 68,900 km2 in area (larger than Lake Huron, the second largest of North America’s Great Lakes).
7.47.3	Biologists were studying species of a family of fish called cichlids.
7.47.4	They found that as they sampled for fish in different locations of the lake, they never stopped finding new species, and they identified nearly 500 evolved types of cichlids.
7.47.5	But while studying these variations, they quickly discovered that the invasive Nile Perch was destroying the lake’s cichlid population, bringing hundreds of cichlid species to extinction with devastating rapidity.
7.47.6	The Biodiversity Crisis
7.47.7	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define biodiversity Describe biodiversity as the equilibrium of naturally fluctuating rates of extinction and speciation Identify historical causes of high extinction rates in Earth’s history Traditionally, ecologists have measured biodiversity, a general term for the variety present in the biosphere, by taking into account both the number of species and their commonness.
7.47.8	Biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things.
7.47.9	These estimation indexes, which came from information theory, are most useful as a first step in quantifying biodiversity between and within ecosystems; they are less useful when the main concern among conservation biologists is simply the loss of biodiversity.
7.47.10	However, biologists recognize that measures of biodiversity, in terms of species diversity, may help focus efforts to preserve the biologically or technologically important elements of biodiversity.
7.47.11	The Lake Victoria cichlids provide an example through which we can begin to understand biodiversity.
7.47.12	The biologists studying cichlids in the 1980s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of specializations to particular habitat types and specific feeding strategies: eating plankton floating in the water, scraping and then eating algae from rocks, eating insect larvae from the bottom, and eating the eggs of other species of cichlid.
7.47.13	The cichlids of Lake Victoria are the product of an adaptive radiation.
7.47.14	An adaptive radiation is a rapid (less than three million years in the case of the Lake Victoria cichlids) branching through speciation of a phylogenetic tree into many closely related species; typically, the species “radiate” into different habitats and niches.
7.47.15	The Galápagos finches are an example of a modest adaptive radiation with 15 species.
7.47.16	The cichlids of Lake Victoria are an example of a spectacular adaptive radiation that includes about 500 species.
7.47.17	At the time biologists were making this discovery, some species began to quickly disappear.
7.47.18	A culprit in these declines was a species of large fish that was introduced to Lake Victoria by fisheries to feed the people living around the lake.
7.47.19	The Nile perch was introduced in 1963, but lay low until the 1980s when its populations began to surge.
7.47.20	The Nile perch population grew by consuming cichlids, driving species after species to the point of extinction (the disappearance of a species).
7.47.21	In fact, there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria: the Nile perch, declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria, and increased fishing pressure.
7.47.22	Scientists had not even catalogued all of the species present
7.47.23	—
7.47.24	so many were lost that were never named.
7.47.25	The diversity is now a shadow of what it once was.
7.47.26	The cichlids of Lake Victoria are a thumbnail sketch of contemporary rapid species loss that occurs all over Earth and is caused by human activity.
7.47.27	Extinction is a natural process of macroevolution that occurs at the rate of about one out of 1 million species becoming extinct per year.
7.47.28	The fossil record reveals that there have been five periods of mass extinction in history with much higher rates of species loss, and the rate of species loss today is comparable to those periods of mass extinction.
7.47.29	However, there is a major difference between the previous mass extinctions and the current extinction we are experiencing: human activity.
7.47.30	Specifically, three human activities have a major impact: destruction of habitat, introduction of exotic species, and over-harvesting.
7.47.31	Predictions of species loss within the next century, a tiny amount of time on geological timescales, range from 10 percent to 50 percent.
7.47.32	Extinctions on this scale have only happened five other times in the history of the planet, and they have been caused by cataclysmic events that changed the course of the history of life in each instance.
7.47.33	Earth is now in one of those times.
7.47.34	Types of Biodiversity Scientists generally accept that the term biodiversity describes the number and kinds of species in a location or on the planet.
7.47.35	Species can be difficult to define, but most biologists still feel comfortable with the concept and are able to identify and count eukaryotic species in most contexts.
7.47.36	Biologists have also identified alternate measures of biodiversity, some of which are important for planning how to preserve biodiversity.
7.47.37	Genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts.
7.47.38	Genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a species.
7.47.39	A species’ future potential for adaptation depends on the genetic diversity held in the genomes of the individuals in populations that make up the species.
7.47.40	The same is true for higher taxonomic categories.
7.47.41	A genus with very different types of species will have more genetic diversity than a genus with species that look alike and have similar ecologies.
7.47.42	If there were a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for subsequent evolution is the most genetically diverse one.
7.47.43	It would be ideal not to have to make such choices, but increasingly this may be the norm.
7.47.44	Many genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing.
7.47.45	Genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells, both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism.
7.47.46	This chemical diversity has potential benefit for humans as a source of pharmaceuticals, so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare.
7.47.47	Humans have generated diversity in domestic animals, plants, and fungi.
7.47.48	This diversity is also suffering losses because of migration, market forces, and increasing globalism in agriculture, especially in heavily populated regions such as China, India, and Japan.
7.47.49	The human population directly depends on this diversity as a stable food source, and its decline is troubling biologists and agricultural scientists.
7.47.50	It is also useful to define ecosystem diversity, meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given geographic area (Figure 47.2).
7.47.51	Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems.
7.47.52	The loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between species, the loss of unique features of coadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create.
7.47.53	An example of a largely extinct ecosystem in North America is the prairie ecosystem.
7.47.54	Prairies once spanned central North America from the boreal forest in northern Canada down into Mexico.
7.47.55	They are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl.
7.47.56	Many of the species survive, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most productive agricultural soils is now gone.
7.47.57	As a consequence, soils are disappearing or must be maintained at greater expense.
7.47.58	The variety of ecosystems on Earth—from (a) coral reef to
7.47.59	(b) prairie—enables a great diversity of species to exist.
7.47.60	Current Species Diversity
7.47.61	Despite considerable effort, knowledge of the species that inhabit the planet is limited.
7.47.62	A recent estimate suggests that the eukaryote species for which science has names, about 1.5 million species, account for less than 20 percent of the total number of eukaryote species present on the planet (8.7 million species, by one estimate).
7.47.63	Estimates of numbers of prokaryotic species are largely guesses, but biologists agree that science has only begun to catalog their diversity.
7.47.64	Even with what is known, there is no central repository of names or samples of the described species; therefore, there is no way to be sure that the 1.5 million descriptions is an accurate number.
7.47.65	It is a best guess based on the opinions of experts in different taxonomic groups.
7.47.66	Given that Earth is losing species at an accelerating pace, science is very much in the place it was with the Lake Victoria cichlids: knowing little about what is being lost.
7.47.67	Table 47.1 presents recent estimates of biodiversity in different groups.
7.47.68	There are various initiatives to catalog described species in accessible ways, and the internet is facilitating that effort.
7.47.69	Nevertheless, it has been pointed out that at the current rate of species description, which according to the State of Observed Species Report is 17,000 to 20,000 new species per year, it will take close to 500 years to finish describing life on this planet.
7.47.70	[4]
7.47.71	Over time, the task becomes both increasingly impossible and increasingly easier as extinction removes species from the planet.
7.47.72	Naming and counting species may seem an unimportant pursuit given the other needs of humanity, but it is not simply an accounting.
7.47.73	Describing species is a complex process by which biologists determine an organism’s unique characteristics and whether or not that organism belongs to any other described species.
7.47.74	It allows biologists to find and recognize the species after the initial discovery, and allows them to follow up on questions about its biology.
7.47.75	In addition, the unique characteristics of each species make it potentially valuable to humans or other species on which humans depend.
7.47.76	Understanding these characteristics is the value of finding and naming species.
7.47.77	Patterns of Biodiversity Biodiversity is not evenly distributed on Earth.
7.47.78	Lake Victoria contained almost 500 species of cichlids alone, ignoring the other fish families present in the lake.
7.47.79	All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria; therefore, the 500 species of cichlids were endemic.
7.47.80	Endemic species are found in only one location.
7.47.81	Endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction.
7.47.82	Higher taxonomic levels, such as genera and families, can also be endemic.
7.47.83	Lake Huron contains about 79 species of fish, all of which are found in many other lakes in North America.
7.47.84	What accounts for the difference in fish diversity in these two lakes?
7.47.85	Lake Victoria is a tropical lake, while Lake Huron is a temperate lake.
7.47.86	Lake Huron in its present form is only about 7,000 years old, while Lake Victoria in its present form is about 15,000 years old.
7.47.87	Biogeographers have suggested these two factors, latitude and age, are two of several hypotheses to explain biodiversity patterns on the planet.
7.47.88	One of the oldest observed patterns in ecology is that species biodiversity in almost every taxonomic group increases as latitude declines.
7.47.89	In other words, biodiversity increases closer to the equator.
7.47.90	This map illustrates the number of amphibian species across the globe and shows the trend toward higher biodiversity at lower latitudes.
7.47.91	A similar pattern is observed for most taxonomic groups.
7.47.92	It is not yet clear why biodiversity increases closer to the equator, but hypotheses include the greater age of the ecosystems in the tropics versus temperate regions that were largely devoid of life or drastically impoverished during the last glaciation.
7.47.93	The idea is that greater age provides more time for speciation.
7.47.94	Another possible explanation is the increased energy the tropics receive from the sun versus the decreased energy that temperate and polar regions receive.
7.47.95	It is not entirely clear how greater energy input could translate into more species.
7.47.96	The complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation by increasing the heterogeneity, or number of ecological niches, in the tropics relative to higher latitudes.
7.47.97	The greater heterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution, specialization, and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population differentiation.
7.47.98	However, this hypothesis suffers from some circularity—ecosystems with more species encourage speciation, but how did they get more species to begin with?
7.47.99	The tropics have been perceived as being more stable than temperate regions, which have a pronounced climate and day-length seasonality.
7.47.100	The tropics have their own forms of seasonality, such as rainfall, but they are generally assumed to be more stable environments and this stability might promote speciation.
7.47.101	Regardless of the mechanisms, it is certainly true that all levels of biodiversity are greatest in the tropics.
7.47.102	Additionally, the rate of endemism is highest, and there are more biodiversity hotspots.
7.47.103	However, this richness of diversity also means that knowledge of species is lowest, and there is a high potential for biodiversity loss.
7.47.104	Conservation of Biodiversity
7.47.105	In 1988, British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at significant risk for species loss: biodiversity hotspots.
7.47.106	Biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species.
7.47.107	The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts, a kind of conservation triage.
7.47.108	By protecting hotspots, governments are able to protect a larger number of species.
7.47.109	The original criteria for a hotspot included the presence of 1500 or more endemic plant species and 70 percent of the area disturbed by human activity.
7.47.110	There are now 34 biodiversity hotspots (Figure 47.4) containing large numbers of endemic species, which include half of Earth’s endemic plants.
7.47.111	Conservation International has identified 34 biodiversity hotspots, which cover only 2.3 percent of the Earth’s surface but have endemic to them 42 percent of the terrestrial vertebrate species and 50 percent of the world’s plants.
7.47.112	Biodiversity Change through Geological Time
7.47.113	The number of species on the planet, or in any geographical area, is the result of an equilibrium of two evolutionary processes that are ongoing: speciation and extinction.
7.47.114	Both are
7.47.115	natural “
7.47.116	birth”
7.47.117	and “death” processes of macroevolution.
7.47.118	When speciation rates begin to outstrip extinction rates, the number of species will increase; likewise, the number of species will decrease when extinction rates begin to overtake speciation rates.
7.47.119	Throughout Earth’s history, these two processes have fluctuated—sometimes leading to dramatic changes in the number of species on Earth as reflected in the fossil record.
7.47.120	Percent extinction occurrences as reflected in the fossil record have fluctuated throughout Earth’s history.
7.47.121	Sudden and dramatic losses of biodiversity, called mass extinctions, have occurred five times.
7.47.122	Paleontologists have identified five strata in the fossil record that appear to show sudden and dramatic (greater than half of all extant species disappearing from the fossil record) losses in biodiversity.
7.47.123	These are called mass extinctions.
7.47.124	There are many lesser, yet still dramatic, extinction events, but the five mass extinctions have attracted the most research.
7.47.125	An argument can be made that the five mass extinctions are only the five most extreme events in a continuous series of large extinction events throughout the Phanerozoic (since 542 million years ago).
7.47.126	In most cases, the hypothesized causes are still controversial; however, the most recent event seems clear.
7.47.127	The Five Mass Extinctions
7.47.128	The fossil record of the mass extinctions was the basis for defining periods of geological history, so they typically occur at the transition point between geological periods.
7.47.129	The transition in fossils from one period to another reflects the dramatic loss of species and the gradual origin of new species.
7.47.130	These transitions can be seen in the rock strata.
7.47.131	Table 47.2 provides data on the five mass extinctions.
7.47.132	The Ordovician-Silurian extinction event is the first recorded mass extinction and the second largest.
7.47.133	During this period, about 85 percent of marine species (few species lived outside the oceans) became extinct.
7.47.134	The main hypothesis for its cause is a period of glaciation and then warming.
7.47.135	The extinction event actually consists of two extinction events separated by about 1 million years.
7.47.136	The first event was caused by cooling, and the second event was due to the subsequent warming.
7.47.137	The climate changes affected temperatures and sea levels.
7.47.138	Some researchers have suggested that a gamma-ray burst, caused by a nearby supernova, is a possible cause of the Ordovician-Silurian extinction.
7.47.139	The gamma-ray burst would have stripped away the Earth’s ozone layer causing intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun and may account for climate changes observed at the time.
7.47.140	The hypothesis is speculative, but extraterrestrial influences on Earth’s history are an active line of research.
7.47.141	Recovery of biodiversity after the mass extinction took from 5 to 20 million years, depending on the location.
7.47.142	The late Devonian extinction may have occurred over a relatively long period of time.
7.47.143	It appears to have affected marine species and not the plants or animals inhabiting terrestrial habitats.
7.47.144	The causes of this extinction are poorly understood.
7.47.145	The end-Permian extinction was the largest in the history of life.
7.47.146	Indeed, an argument could be made that Earth nearly became devoid of life during this extinction event.
7.47.147	The planet looked very different before and after this event.
7.47.148	Estimates are that 96 percent of all marine species and 70 percent of all terrestrial species were lost.
7.47.149	It was at this time, for example, that the trilobites, a group that survived the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, became extinct.
7.47.150	The causes for this mass extinction are not clear, but the leading suspect is extended and widespread volcanic activity that led to a runaway global-warming event.
7.47.151	The oceans became largely anoxic, suffocating marine life.
7.47.152	Terrestrial tetrapod diversity took 30 million years to recover after the end-Permian extinction.
7.47.153	The Permian extinction dramatically altered Earth’s biodiversity makeup and the course of evolution.
7.47.154	The causes of the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event are not clear and hypotheses of climate change, asteroid impact, and volcanic eruptions have been argued.
7.47.155	The extinction event occurred just before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, although recent scholarship suggests that the extinctions may have occurred more gradually throughout the Triassic.
7.47.156	The causes of the end-Cretaceous extinction event are the ones that are best understood.
7.47.157	It was during this extinction event about 65 million years ago that the dinosaurs, the dominant vertebrate group for millions of years, disappeared from the planet (with the exception of a theropod clade that gave rise to birds).
7.47.158	Indeed, every land animal that weighed more then 25 kg became extinct.
7.47.159	The cause of this extinction is now understood to be the result of a cataclysmic impact of a large meteorite, or asteroid, off the coast of what is now the Yucatán Peninsula.
7.47.160	This hypothesis, proposed first in 1980, was a radical explanation based on a sharp spike in the levels of iridium (which rains down from space in meteors at a fairly constant rate but is otherwise absent on Earth’s surface) at the rock stratum that marks the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods (Figure 47.6).
7.47.161	This boundary marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs in fossils as well as many other taxa.
7.47.162	The researchers who discovered the iridium spike interpreted it as a rapid influx of iridium from space to the atmosphere (in the form of a large asteroid) rather than a slowing in the deposition of sediments during that period.
7.47.163	It was a radical explanation, but the report of an appropriately aged and sized impact crater in 1991 made the hypothesis more believable.
7.47.164	Now an abundance of geological evidence supports the theory.
7.47.165	Recovery times for biodiversity after the end-
7.47.166	Cretaceous extinction are shorter, in geological time, than for the end-Permian extinction, on the order of 10 million years.
7.47.167	The Pleistocene Extinction
7.47.168	The Pleistocene Extinction is one of the lesser extinctions, and a recent one.
7.47.169	It is well known that the North American, and to some degree Eurasian, megafauna, or large animals, disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period.
7.47.170	The extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,000–12,000 years ago.
7.47.171	In North America, the losses were quite dramatic and included the woolly mammoths (last dated about 4,000 years ago in an isolated population), mastodon, giant beavers, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed cats, and the North American camel, just to name a few.
7.47.172	The possibility that the rapid extinction of these large animals was caused by over-hunting was first suggested in the 1900s.
7.47.173	Research into this hypothesis continues today.
7.47.174	It seems likely that over-hunting caused many pre-written history extinctions in many regions of the world.
7.47.175	In general, the timing of the Pleistocene extinctions correlated with the arrival of humans and not with climate-change events, which is the main competing hypothesis for these extinctions.
7.47.176	The extinctions began in Australia about 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, just after the arrival of humans in the area: a marsupial lion, a giant one-ton wombat, and several giant kangaroo species disappeared.
7.47.177	In North America, the extinctions of almost all of the large mammals occurred 10,000–12,000 years ago.
7.47.178	All that are left are the smaller mammals such as bears, elk, moose, and cougars.
7.47.179	Finally, on many remote oceanic islands, the extinctions of many species occurred coincident with human arrivals.
7.47.180	Not all of the islands had large animals, but when there were large animals, they were lost.
7.47.181	Madagascar was colonized about 2,000 years ago and the large mammals that lived there became extinct.
7.47.182	Eurasia and Africa do not show this pattern, but they also did not experience a recent arrival of humans.
7.47.183	Humans arrived in Eurasia hundreds of thousands of years ago after the origin of the species in Africa.
7.47.184	This topic remains an area of active research and hypothesizing.
7.47.185	It seems clear that even if climate played a role, in most cases human hunting precipitated the extinctions.
7.47.186	Present-Time Extinctions
7.47.187	The sixth, or Holocene, mass extinction appears to have begun earlier than previously believed and has mostly to do with the activities of Homo sapiens.
7.47.188	Since the beginning of the Holocene period, there are numerous recent extinctions of individual species that are recorded in human writings.
7.47.189	Most of these are coincident with the expansion of the European colonies since the 1500s.
7.47.190	One of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird.
7.47.191	The dodo bird lived in the forests of Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean.
7.47.192	The dodo bird became extinct around 1662.
7.47.193	It was hunted for its meat by sailors and was easy prey because the dodo, which did not evolve with humans, would approach people without fear.
7.47.194	Introduced pigs, rats, and dogs brought to the island by European ships also killed dodo young and eggs.
7.47.195	Steller's sea cow became extinct in 1768; it was related to the manatee and probably once lived along the northwest coast of North America.
7.47.196	Steller's sea cow was first discovered by Europeans in 1741 and was hunted for meat and oil.
7.47.197	The last sea cow was killed in 1768.
7.47.198	That amounts to 27 years between the sea cow’s first contact with Europeans and extinction of the species.
7.47.199	In 1914, the last living passenger pigeon died in a zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio.
7.47.200	This species had once darkened the skies of North America during its migrations, but it was hunted and suffered from habitat loss through the clearing of forests for farmland.
7.47.201	In 1918, the last living Carolina parakeet died in captivity.
7.47.202	This species was once common in the eastern United States, but it suffered from habitat loss.
7.47.203	The species was also hunted because it ate orchard fruit when its native foods were destroyed to make way for farmland.
7.47.204	The Japanese sea lion, which inhabited a broad area around Japan and the coast of Korea, became extinct in the 1950s due to fishermen.
7.47.205	The Caribbean monk seal was distributed throughout the Caribbean Sea but was driven to extinction via hunting by 1952.
7.47.206	These are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the past 500 years.
7.47.207	The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) keeps a list of extinct and endangered species called the Red List.
7.47.208	The list is not complete, but it describes 380 extinct species of vertebrates after 1500 AD, 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting or overfishing.
7.47.209	Estimates of Present-Time Extinction Rates Estimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation.
7.47.210	The extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans, especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way.
7.47.211	But there are many organisms that are of less interest to humans (not necessarily of less value) and many that are undescribed.
7.47.212	The background extinction rate is estimated to be about one per million species per year (E/MSY).
7.47.213	For example, assuming there are about ten million species in existence, the expectation is that ten species would become extinct each year (each year represents ten million species per year).
7.47.214	One contemporary extinction rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year 1500.
7.47.215	For birds alone this method yields an estimate of 26 E/MSY.
7.47.216	However, this value may be underestimated for three reasons.
7.47.217	First, many species would not have been described until much later in the time period, so their loss would have gone unnoticed.
7.47.218	Second, the number of recently extinct species is increasing because extinct species now are being described from skeletal remains.
7.47.219	And third, some species are probably already extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such.
7.47.220	Taking these factors into account raises the estimated extinction rate closer to 100 E/MSY.
7.47.221	The predicted rate by the end of the century is 1500 E/MSY.
7.47.222	A second approach to estimating present-time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest-area loss and understanding species-area relationships.
7.47.223	The species-area relationship is the rate at which new species are seen when the area surveyed is increased.
7.47.224	Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island increases.
7.47.225	This phenomenon has also been shown to hold true in other habitats as well.
7.47.226	Turning this relationship around, if the habitat area is reduced, the number of species living there will also decline.
7.47.227	Estimates of extinction rates based on habitat loss and species-area relationships have suggested that with about 90 percent habitat loss an expected 50 percent of species would become extinct.
7.47.228	Species-area estimates have led to species extinction rate calculations of about 1000 E/MSY and higher.
7.47.229	In general, actual observations do not show this amount of loss and suggestions have been made that there is a delay in extinction.
7.47.230	Recent work has also called into question the applicability of the species-area relationship when estimating the loss of species.
7.47.231	This work argues that the species-area relationship leads to an overestimate of extinction rates.
7.47.232	A better relationship to use may be the endemics-area relationship.
7.47.233	Using this method would bring estimates down to around 500 E/MSY in the coming century.
7.47.234	Note that this value is still 500 times the background rate.
7.47.235	Studies have shown that the number of species present increases with the size of the habitat.
7.47.236	The Importance of Biodiversity to Human Life
7.47.237	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify chemical diversity benefits to humans Identify biodiversity components that support human agriculture Describe ecosystem services
7.47.238	It may not be clear why biologists are concerned about biodiversity loss.
7.47.239	When biodiversity loss is thought of as the extinction of the passenger pigeon, the dodo bird, and even the woolly mammoth, the loss may appear to be an emotional one.
7.47.240	But is the loss practically important for the welfare of the human species?
7.47.241	From the perspective of evolution and ecology, the loss of a particular individual species is unimportant (however, the loss of a keystone species can lead to ecological disaster).
7.47.242	Extinction is a normal part of macroevolution.
7.47.243	But the accelerated extinction rate means the loss of tens of thousands of species within our lifetimes, and it is likely to have dramatic effects on human welfare through the collapse of ecosystems and in added costs to maintain food production, clean air and water, and human health.
7.47.244	Agriculture began after early hunter-gatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate environment.
7.47.245	This cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on undomesticated living things on the planet.
7.47.246	Biologists recognize the human species is embedded in ecosystems and is dependent on them, just as every other species on the planet is dependent.
7.47.247	Technology smoothes out the extremes of existence, but ultimately the human species cannot exist without its ecosystem.
7.47.248	Human Health Contemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area.
7.47.249	Most plants produce secondary plant compounds, which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them, but some of which also work as medication.
7.47.250	For centuries in Europe, older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals—books that identified plants and their uses.
7.47.251	Humans are not the only species to use plants for medicinal reasons: the great apes, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have all been observed self-medicating with plants.
7.47.252	Modern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds.
7.47.253	Examples of significant medicines derived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine (Figure 47.8).
7.47.254	Many medicines were once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized.
7.47.255	It is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of modern drugs contained at least one plant extract.
7.47.256	That number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are replaced by synthetic versions.
7.47.257	Antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health and lifespans in developed countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria.
7.47.258	Catharanthus roseus, the Madagascar periwinkle, has various medicinal properties.
7.47.259	Among other uses, it is a source of vincristine, a drug used in the treatment of lymphomas.
7.47.260	In recent years, animal venoms and poisons have excited intense research for their medicinal potential.
7.47.261	By 2007, the FDA had approved five drugs based on animal toxins to treat diseases such as hypertension, chronic pain, and diabetes.
7.47.262	Another five drugs are undergoing clinical trials, and at least six drugs are being used in other countries.
7.47.263	Other toxins under investigation come from mammals, snakes, lizards, various amphibians, fish, snails, octopuses, and scorpions.
7.47.264	Aside from representing billions of dollars in profits, these medicines improve people’s lives.
7.47.265	Pharmaceutical companies are actively looking for new compounds synthesized by living organisms that can function as medicine.
7.47.266	It is estimated that 1/3 of pharmaceutical research and development is spent on natural compounds and that about 35 percent of new drugs brought to market between 1981 and 2002 were from natural compounds.
7.47.267	The opportunities for new medications will be reduced in direct proportion to the disappearance of species.
7.47.268	Agricultural Diversity
7.47.269	Since the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding and selecting crop varieties.
7.47.270	This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of humans.
7.47.271	For example, potatoes were domesticated beginning around 7,000 years ago in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia.
7.47.272	The potatoes grown in that region belong to seven species and the number of varieties likely is in the thousands.
7.47.273	Each variety has been bred to thrive at particular elevations and soil and climate conditions.
7.47.274	The diversity is driven by the diverse demands of the topography, the limited movement of people, and the demands created by crop rotation for different varieties that will do well in different fields.
7.47.275	Potatoes are only one example of human-generated diversity.
7.47.276	Every plant, animal, and fungus that has been cultivated by humans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising from the demands for food value, adaptation to growing conditions, and resistance to pests.
7.47.277	The potato demonstrates a well-known example of the risks of low crop diversity: the tragic Irish potato famine when the single variety grown in Ireland became susceptible to a potato blight, wiping out the crop.
7.47.278	The loss of the crop led to famine, death, and mass emigration.
7.47.279	Resistance to disease is a chief benefit to maintaining crop biodiversity, and lack of diversity in contemporary crop species carries similar risks.
7.47.280	Seed companies, which are the source of most crop varieties in developed countries, must continually breed new varieties to keep up with evolving pest organisms.
7.47.281	These same seed companies, however, have participated in the decline of the number of varieties available as they focus on selling fewer varieties in more areas of the world.
7.47.282	The ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the accessibility of wild forms related to the crop plant.
7.47.283	These wild forms are often the source of new gene variants that can be bred with existing varieties to create varieties with new attributes.
7.47.284	Loss of wild species related to a crop will mean the loss of potential in crop improvement.
7.47.285	Maintaining the genetic diversity of wild species related to domesticated species ensures our continued food supply.
7.47.286	Since the 1920s, government agriculture departments have maintained seed banks of crop varieties as a way to maintain crop diversity.
7.47.287	This system has flaws because, over time, seed banks are lost through accidents, and there is no way to replace them.
7.47.288	In 2008, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (Figure 47.9) began storing seeds from around the world as a backup system to the regional seed banks.
7.47.289	If a regional seed bank stores varieties in Svalbard, losses can be replaced from Svalbard.
7.47.290	The seed vault is located deep into the rock of an arctic island.
7.47.291	Conditions within the vault are maintained at ideal temperature and humidity for seed survival, but the deep underground location of the vault in the arctic means that failure of the vault’s systems will not compromise the climatic conditions inside the vault.
7.47.292	Crop success s is largely dependent on the quality of the soil.
7.47.293	Although some agricultural soils are rendered sterile using controversial cultivation and chemical treatments, most contain a huge diversity of organisms that maintain nutrient cycles—breaking down organic matter into nutrient compounds that crops need for growth.
7.47.294	These organisms also maintain soil texture that affects water and oxygen dynamics in the soil that are necessary for plant growth.
7.47.295	If farmers had to maintain arable soil using alternate means, the cost of food would be much higher than it is now.
7.47.296	These kinds of processes are called ecosystem services.
7.47.297	They occur within ecosystems, such as soil ecosystems, as a result of the diverse metabolic activities of the organisms living there, but they provide benefits to human food production, drinking water availability, and breathable air.
7.47.298	Other key ecosystem services related to food production are plant pollination and crop pest control.
7.47.299	Over 150 crops in the United States require pollination to produce.
7.47.300	One estimate of the benefit of honeybee pollination within the United States is $1.6 billion per year; other pollinators contribute up to $6.7 billion more.
7.47.301	Many honeybee populations are managed by apiarists who rent out their hives’ services to farmers.
7.47.302	Honeybee populations in North America have been suffering large losses caused by a syndrome known as colony collapse disorder, whose cause is unclear.
7.47.303	Other pollinators include a diverse array of other bee species and various insects and birds.
7.47.304	Loss of these species would make growing crops requiring pollination impossible, increasing dependence on other crops.
7.47.305	Finally, humans compete for their food with crop pests, most of which are insects.
7.47.306	Pesticides control these competitors; however, pesticides are costly and lose their effectiveness over time as pest populations adapt.
7.47.307	They also lead to collateral damage by killing non-pest species and risking the health of consumers and agricultural workers.
7.47.308	Ecologists believe that the bulk of the work in removing pests is actually done by predators and parasites of those pests, but the impact has not been well studied.
7.47.309	A review found that in 74 percent of studies that looked for an effect of landscape complexity on natural enemies of pests, the greater the complexity, the greater the effect of pest-suppressing organisms.
7.47.310	An experimental study found that introducing multiple enemies of pea aphids (an important alfalfa pest) increased the yield of alfalfa significantly.
7.47.311	This study shows the importance of landscape diversity via the question of whether a diversity of pests is more effective at control than one single pest; the results showed this to be the case.
7.47.312	Loss of diversity in pest enemies will inevitably make it more difficult and costly to grow food.
7.47.313	Wild Food Sources
7.47.314	In addition to growing crops and raising animals for food, humans obtain food resources from wild populations, primarily fish populations.
7.47.315	For approximately 1 billion people, aquatic resources provide the main source of animal protein.
7.47.316	But since 1990, global fish production has declined.
7.47.317	Despite considerable effort, few fisheries on the planet are managed for sustainability.
7.47.318	Fishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested species, but rather to a radical restructuring of the marine ecosystem in which a dominant species is so over-harvested that it becomes a minor player, ecologically.
7.47.319	In addition to humans losing the food source, these alterations affect many other species in ways that are difficult or impossible to predict.
7.47.320	The collapse of fisheries has dramatic and long-lasting effects on local populations that work in the fishery.
7.47.321	In addition, the loss of an inexpensive protein source to populations that cannot afford to replace it will increase the cost of living and limit societies in other ways.
7.47.322	In general, the fish taken from fisheries have shifted to smaller species as larger species are fished to extinction.
7.47.323	The ultimate outcome could clearly be the loss of aquatic systems as food sources.
7.47.324	Psychological and Moral Value
7.47.325	Finally, it has been argued that humans benefit psychologically from living in a biodiverse world.
7.47.326	A chief proponent of this idea is entomologist E. O.Wilson.
7.47.327	He argues that human evolutionary history has adapted us to live in a natural environment and that built environments generate stressors that affect human health and well-being.
7.47.328	There is considerable research into the psychological regenerative benefits of natural landscapes that suggests the hypothesis may hold some truth.
7.47.329	In addition, there is a moral argument that humans have a responsibility to inflict as little harm as possible on other species.
7.47.330	Threats to Biodiversity
7.47.331	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify significant threats to biodiversity Explain the effects of habitat loss, exotic species, and hunting on biodiversity Identify the early and predicted effects of climate change on biodiversity
7.47.332	The core threat to biodiversity on the planet, and therefore a threat to human welfare, is the combination of human population growth and resource exploitation.
7.47.333	The human population requires resources to survive and grow, and those resources are being removed unsustainably from the environment.
7.47.334	The three greatest proximate threats to biodiversity are habitat loss, overharvesting, and introduction of exotic species.
7.47.335	The first two of these are a direct result of human population growth and resource use.
7.47.336	The third results from increased mobility and trade.
7.47.337	A fourth major cause of extinction, anthropogenic climate change, has not yet had a large impact, but it is predicted to become significant during this century.
7.47.338	Global climate change is also a consequence of human population needs for energy and the use of fossil fuels to meet those needs (Figure 47.10).
7.47.339	Environmental issues, such as toxic pollution, have specific targeted effects on species, but they are not generally seen as threats at the magnitude of the others.
7.47.340	Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels fluctuate in a cyclical manner.
7.47.341	However, the burning of fossil fuels in recent history has caused a dramatic increase in the levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere, which have now reached levels never before seen in human history.
7.47.342	Scientists predict that the addition of this “greenhouse gas” to the atmosphere is resulting in climate change that will significantly impact biodiversity in the coming century.
7.47.343	Habitat Loss Humans rely on technology to modify their environment and replace certain functions that were once performed by the natural ecosystem.
7.47.344	Other species cannot do this.
7.47.345	Elimination of their ecosystem—whether it is a forest, a desert, a grassland, a freshwater estuarine, or a marine environment—will kill the individuals in the species.
7.47.346	Remove the entire habitat within the range of a species and, unless they are one of the few species that do well in human-built environments, the species will become extinct.
7.47.347	Human destruction of habitats accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century.
7.47.348	Consider the exceptional biodiversity of Sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of critically endangered elephant, and the Sumatran tiger, but half of Sumatra’s forest is now gone.
7.47.349	The neighboring island of Borneo, home to the other species of orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest.
7.47.350	Forest loss continues in protected areas of Borneo.
7.47.351	The orangutan in Borneo is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it is simply the most visible of thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests of Borneo.
7.47.352	The forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations (Figure 47.11).
7.47.353	Palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics, and biodiesel in Europe.
7.47.354	A five-year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years 2000–2005 was 3.1 percent.
7.47.355	In the humid tropics where forest loss is primarily from timber extraction, 272,000 km2 was lost out of a global total of 11,564,000 km2 (or 2.4 percent).
7.47.356	In the tropics, these losses certainly also represent the extinction of species because of high levels of endemism.
7.47.357	(a) One species of orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, is found only in the rainforests of Borneo, and the other species of orangutan (Pongo abelii) is found only in the rainforests of Sumatra.
7.47.358	These animals are examples of the exceptional biodiversity of (c) the islands of Sumatra and Borneo.
7.47.359	Other species include the (b) Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) and the (d) Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus), both critically endangered species.
7.47.360	Rainforest habitat is being removed to make way for (e) oil palm plantations such as this one in Borneo’s Sabah Province.
7.47.361	Habitat destruction can affect ecosystems other than forests.
7.47.362	Rivers and streams are important ecosystems and are frequently modified through land development and from damming or water removal.
7.47.363	Damming of rivers affects the water flow and access to all parts of a river.
7.47.364	Differing flow regimes can reduce or eliminate populations that are adapted to these changes in flow patterns.
7.47.365	For example, an estimated 91percent of river lengths in the United States have been developed: they have modifications like dams, to create energy or store water; levees, to prevent flooding; or dredging or rerouting, to create land that is more suitable for human development.
7.47.366	Many fish species in the United States, especially rare species or species with restricted distributions, have seen declines caused by river damming and habitat loss.
7.47.367	Research has confirmed that species of amphibians that must carry out parts of their life cycles in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats have a greater chance of suffering population declines and extinction because of the increased likelihood that one of their habitats or access between them will be lost.
7.47.368	Overharvesting Overharvesting is a serious threat to many species, but particularly to aquatic species.
7.47.369	There are many examples of regulated commercial fisheries monitored by fisheries scientists that have nevertheless collapsed.
7.47.370	The western Atlantic cod fishery is the most spectacular recent collapse.
7.47.371	While it was a hugely productive fishery for 400 years, the introduction of modern factory trawlers in the 1980s and the pressure on the fishery led to it becoming unsustainable.
7.47.372	The causes of fishery collapse are both economic and political in nature.
7.47.373	Most fisheries are managed as a common (shared) resource even when the fishing territory lies within a country’s territorial waters.
7.47.374	Common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the tragedy of the commons in which essentially no fisher has a motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when it is not owned by that fisher.
7.47.375	The natural outcome of harvests of resources held in common is their overexploitation.
7.47.376	While large fisheries are regulated to attempt to avoid this pressure, it still exists in the background.
7.47.377	This overexploitation is exacerbated when access to the fishery is open and unregulated and when technology gives fishers the ability to overfish.
7.47.378	In a few fisheries, the biological growth of the resource is less than the potential growth of the profits made from fishing if that time and money were invested elsewhere.
7.47.379	In these cases—whales are an example
7.47.380	—economic forces will always drive toward fishing the population to extinction.
7.47.381	For the most part, fishery extinction is not equivalent to biological extinction—the last fish of a species is rarely fished out of the ocean.
7.47.382	At the same time, fishery extinction is still harmful to fish species and their ecosystems.
7.47.383	There are some instances in which true extinction is a possibility.
7.47.384	Whales have slow-growing populations and are at risk of complete extinction through hunting.
7.47.385	There are some species of sharks with restricted distributions that are at risk of extinction.
7.47.386	The groupers are another population of generally slow-growing fishes that, in the Caribbean, includes a number of species that are at risk of extinction from overfishing.
7.47.387	Coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems that face peril from several processes.
7.47.388	Reefs are home to 1/3 of the world
7.47.389	’s marine fish species
7.47.390	—
7.47.391	about 4,000 species—despite making up only 1 percent of marine habitat.
7.47.392	Most home marine aquaria are stocked with wild-caught organisms, not cultured organisms.
7.47.393	Although no species is known to have been driven extinct by the pet trade in marine species, there are studies showing that populations of some species have declined in response to harvesting, indicating that the harvest is not sustainable at those levels.
7.47.394	There are concerns about the effect of the pet trade on some terrestrial species such as turtles, amphibians, birds, plants, and even the orangutan.
7.47.395	Bush meat is the generic term used for wild animals killed for food.
7.47.396	Hunting is practiced throughout the world, but hunting practices, particularly in equatorial Africa and parts of Asia, are believed to threaten several species with extinction.
7.47.397	Traditionally, bush meat in Africa was hunted to feed families directly; however, recent commercialization of the practice now has bush meat available in grocery stores, which has increased harvest rates to the level of unsustainability.
7.47.398	Additionally, human population growth has increased the need for protein foods that are not being met from agriculture.
7.47.399	Species threatened by the bush meat trade are mostly mammals including many primates living in the Congo basin.
7.47.400	Exotic Species Exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an ecosystem in which they did not evolve.
7.47.401	Such introductions likely occur frequently as natural phenomena.
7.47.402	For example, Kudzu (Pueraria lobata), which is native to Japan, was introduced in the United States in 1876.
7.47.403	It was later planted for soil conservation.
7.47.404	Problematically, it grows too well in the southeastern United States—up to a foot a day.
7.47.405	It is now a pest species and covers over 7 million acres in the southeastern United States.
7.47.406	If an introduced species is able to survive in its new habitat, that introduction is now reflected in the observed range of the species.
7.47.407	Human transportation of people and goods, including the intentional transport of organisms for trade, has dramatically increased the introduction of species into new ecosystems, sometimes at distances that are well beyond the capacity of the species to ever travel itself and outside the range of the species’ natural predators.
7.47.408	Most exotic species introductions probably fail because of the low number of individuals introduced or poor adaptation to the ecosystem they enter.
7.47.409	Some species, however, possess preadaptations that can make them especially successful in a new ecosystem.
7.47.410	These exotic species often undergo dramatic population increases in their new habitat and reset the ecological conditions in the new environment, threatening the species that exist there.
7.47.411	For this reason, exotic species are also called invasive species.
7.47.412	Exotic species can threaten other species through competition for resources, predation, or disease.
7.47.413	Lakes and islands are particularly vulnerable to extinction threats from introduced species.
7.47.414	In Lake Victoria, as mentioned earlier, the intentional introduction of the Nile perch was largely responsible for the extinction of about 200 species of cichlids.
7.47.415	The accidental introduction of the brown tree snake via aircraft (Figure 47.12) from the Solomon Islands to Guam in 1950 has led to the extinction of three species of birds and three to five species of reptiles endemic to the island.
7.47.416	Several other species are still threatened.
7.47.417	The brown tree snake is adept at exploiting human transportation as a means to migrate; one was even found on an aircraft arriving in Corpus Christi, Texas.
7.47.418	Constant vigilance on the part of airport, military, and commercial aircraft personnel is required to prevent the snake from moving from Guam to other islands in the Pacific, especially Hawaii.
7.47.419	Islands do not make up a large area of land on the globe, but they do contain a disproportionate number of endemic species because of their isolation from mainland ancestors.
7.47.420	The brown tree snake, Boiga irregularis, is an exotic species that has caused numerous extinctions on the island of Guam since its accidental introduction in 1950.

7.47.422	(credit: NPS)
7.47.423	It now appears that the global decline in amphibian species recognized in the 1990s is, in some part, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis (Figure 47.13).
7.47.424	There is evidence that the fungus is native to Africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport of a commonly used laboratory and pet species: the African clawed toad (Xenopus laevis).
7.47.425	It may well be that biologists themselves are responsible for spreading this disease worldwide.
7.47.426	The North American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, which has also been widely introduced as a food animal but which easily escapes captivity, survives most infections of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and can act as a reservoir for the disease.
7.47.427	This Limosa Harlequin Frog (Atelopus limosus), an endangered species from Panama, died from a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis.
7.47.428	The red lesions are symptomatic of the disease.
7.47.429	Early evidence suggests that another fungal pathogen, Geomyces destructans, introduced from Europe is responsible for white-nose syndrome, which infects cave-hibernating bats in eastern North America and has spread from a point of origin in western New York State (Figure 47.14).
7.47.430	The disease has decimated bat populations and threatens extinction of species already listed as endangered: the Indiana bat, Myotis sodalis, and potentially the Virginia big-eared bat, Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus.
7.47.431	How the fungus was introduced is unclear, but one logical presumption would be that recreational cavers unintentionally brought the fungus on clothes or equipment from Europe.
7.47.432	This little brown bat in Greeley Mine, Vermont, March 26, 2009, was found to have white-nose syndrome.
7.47.433	Climate Change Climate change, and specifically the anthropogenic (meaning, caused by humans) warming trend presently underway, is recognized as a major extinction threat, particularly when combined with other threats such as habitat loss.
7.47.434	Scientists disagree about the likely magnitude of the effects, with extinction rate estimates ranging from 15 percent to 40 percent of species committed to extinction by 2050.
7.47.435	Scientists do agree, however, that climate change will alter regional climates, including rainfall and snowfall patterns, making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them.
7.47.436	The warming trend will shift colder climates toward the north and south poles, forcing species to move with their adapted climate norms while facing habitat gaps along the way.
7.47.437	The shifting ranges will impose new competitive regimes on species as they find themselves in contact with other species not present in their historic range.
7.47.438	One such unexpected species contact is between polar bears and grizzly bears.
7.47.439	Previously, these two species had separate ranges.
7.47.440	Now, their ranges are overlapping and there are documented cases of these two species mating and producing viable offspring.
7.47.441	Changing climates also throw off species’ delicate timing adaptations to seasonal food resources and breeding times.
7.47.442	Many contemporary mismatches to shifts in resource availability and timing have already been documented.
7.47.443	Since 2008, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) have been spotted farther north than their historic range, a possible consequence of climate change.
7.47.444	As a result, grizzly bear habitat now overlaps polar bear (Ursus maritimus) habitat.
7.47.445	The two kinds of bears, which are capable of mating and producing viable offspring, are considered separate species as historically they lived in different habitats and never met.
7.47.446	However, in 2006 a hunter shot a wild grizzly-polar bear hybrid known as a grolar bear, the first wild hybrid ever found.
7.47.447	Range shifts are already being observed: for example, some European bird species ranges have moved 91 km northward.
7.47.448	The same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the populations are not moving quickly enough.
7.47.449	Range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects, freshwater fishes, reptiles, and mammals.
7.47.450	Climate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat for those species adapted to the highest elevations.
7.47.451	Some climates will completely disappear.
7.47.452	The rate of warming appears to be accelerated in the arctic, which is recognized as a serious threat to polar bear populations that require sea ice to hunt seals during the winter months: seals are the only source of protein available to polar bears.
7.47.453	A trend to decreasing sea ice coverage has occurred since observations began in the mid-twentieth century.
7.47.454	The rate of decline observed in recent years is far greater than previously predicted by climate models.
7.47.455	Finally, global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer water.
7.47.456	Shorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect on some species, and a number of islands will disappear entirely.
7.47.457	Additionally, the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation mountains—a cycle that has provided freshwater to environments for centuries—will also be jeopardized.
7.47.458	This could result in an overabundance of salt water and a shortage of fresh water.
7.47.459	Preserving Biodiversity
7.47.460	By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify new technologies for describing biodiversity Explain the legislative framework for conservation Describe principles and challenges of conservation preserve design Identify examples of the effects of habitat restoration Discuss the role of zoos in biodiversity conservation Preserving biodiversity is an extraordinary challenge that must be met by greater understanding of biodiversity itself, changes in human behavior and beliefs, and various preservation strategies.
7.47.461	Measuring Biodiversity
7.47.462	The technology of molecular genetics and data processing and storage are maturing to the point where cataloguing the planet’s species in an accessible way is close to feasible.
7.47.463	DNA barcoding is one molecular genetic method, which takes advantage of rapid evolution in a mitochondrial gene present in eukaryotes, excepting the plants, to identify species using the sequence of portions of the gene.
7.47.464	Plants may be barcoded using a combination of chloroplast genes.
7.47.465	Rapid mass sequencing machines make the molecular genetics portion of the work relatively inexpensive and quick.
7.47.466	Computer resources store and make available the large volumes of data.
7.47.467	Projects are currently underway to use DNA barcoding to catalog museum specimens, which have already been named and studied, as well as testing the method on less studied groups.
7.47.468	As of mid 2012, close to 150,000 named species had been barcoded.
7.47.469	Early studies suggest there are significant numbers of undescribed species that looked too much like sibling species to previously be recognized as different.
7.47.470	These now can be identified with DNA barcoding.
7.47.471	Numerous computer databases now provide information about named species and a framework for adding new species.
7.47.472	However, as already noted, at the present rate of description of new species, it will take close to 500 years before the complete catalog of life is known.
7.47.473	Many, perhaps most, species on the planet do not have that much time.
7.47.474	There is also the problem of understanding which species known to science are threatened and to what degree they are threatened.
7.47.475	This task is carried out by the non-profit IUCN which, as previously mentioned, maintains the Red List—an online listing of endangered species categorized by taxonomy, type of threat, and other criteria (Figure 47.16).
7.47.476	The Red List is supported by scientific research.
7.47.477	In 2011, the list contained 61,000 species, all with supporting documentation.
7.47.478	Changing Human Behavior Legislation throughout the world has been enacted to protect species.
7.47.479	The legislation includes international treaties as well as national and state laws.
7.47.480	The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) treaty came into force in 1975.
7.47.481	The treaty, and the national legislation that supports it, provides a legal framework for preventing approximately 33,000 listed species from being transported across nations’ borders, thus protecting them from being caught or killed when international trade is involved.
7.47.482	The treaty is limited in its reach because it only deals with international movement of organisms or their parts.
7.47.483	It is also limited by various countries’ ability or willingness to enforce the treaty and supporting legislation.
7.47.484	The illegal trade in organisms and their parts is probably a market in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
7.47.485	Illegal wildlife trade is monitored by another non-profit: Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC).
7.47.486	Within many countries there are laws that protect endangered species and regulate hunting and fishing.
7.47.487	In the United States, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted in 1973.
7.47.488	Species at risk are listed by the Act; the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service is required by law to develop management plans that protect the listed species and bring them back to sustainable numbers.
7.47.489	The Act, and others like it in other countries, is a useful tool, but it suffers because it is often difficult to get a species listed, or to get an effective management plan in place once it is listed.
7.47.490	Additionally, species may be controversially taken off the list without necessarily having had a change in their situation.
7.47.491	More fundamentally, the approach to protecting individual species rather than entire ecosystems is both inefficient and focuses efforts on a few highly visible and often charismatic species, perhaps at the expense of other species that go unprotected.
7.47.492	At the same time, the Act has a critical habitat provision outlined in the recovery mechanism that may benefit species other than the one targeted for management.
7.47.493	The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) is an agreement between the United States and Canada that was signed into law in 1918 in response to declines in North American bird species caused by hunting.
7.47.494	The Act now lists over 800 protected species.
7.47.495	It makes it illegal to disturb or kill the protected species or distribute their parts (much of the hunting of birds in the past was for their feathers).
7.47.496	The international response to global warming has been mixed.
7.47.497	The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement that came out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that committed countries to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, was ratified by some countries, but spurned by others.
7.47.498	Two important countries in terms of their potential impact that did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol were the United States and China.
7.47.499	The United States rejected it as a result of a powerful fossil fuel industry and China because of a concern it would stifle the nation’s growth.
7.47.500	Some goals for reduction in greenhouse gasses were met and exceeded by individual countries, but worldwide, the effort to limit greenhouse gas production is not succeeding.
7.47.501	The intended replacement for the Kyoto Protocol has not materialized because governments cannot agree on timelines and benchmarks.
7.47.502	Meanwhile, climate scientists predict the resulting costs to human societies and biodiversity will be high.
7.47.503	As already mentioned, the private non-profit sector plays a large role in the conservation effort both in North America and around the world.
7.47.504	The approaches range from species-specific organizations to the broadly focused IUCN and TRAFFIC.
7.47.505	The Nature Conservancy takes a novel approach.
7.47.506	It purchases land and protects it in an attempt to set up preserves for ecosystems.
7.47.507	Ultimately, human behavior will change when human values change.
7.47.508	At present, the growing urbanization of the human population is a force that poses challenges to the valuing of biodiversity.
7.47.509	Conservation in Preserves Establishment of wildlife and ecosystem preserves is one of the key tools in conservation efforts.
7.47.510	A preserve is an area of land set aside with varying degrees of protection for the organisms that exist within the boundaries of the preserve.
7.47.511	Preserves can be effective in the short term for protecting both species and ecosystems, but they face challenges that scientists are still exploring to strengthen their viability as long-term solutions.
7.47.512	How Much Area to Preserve?
7.47.513	Due to the way protected lands are allocated (they tend to contain less economically valuable resources rather than being set aside specifically for the species or ecosystems at risk) and the way biodiversity is distributed, determining a target percentage of land or marine habitat that should be protected to maintain biodiversity levels is challenging.
7.47.514	The IUCNWorld Parks Congress estimated that 11.5 percent of Earth’s land surface was covered by preserves of various kinds in 2003.
7.47.515	This area is greater than previous goals; however, it only represents 9 out of 14 recognized major biomes.
7.47.516	Research has shown that 12 percent of all species live only outside preserves; these percentages are much higher when only threatened species and high quality preserves are considered.
7.47.517	For example, high quality preserves include only about 50 percent of threatened amphibian species.
7.47.518	The conclusion must be that either the percentage of area protected must increase, or the percentage of high quality preserves must increase, or preserves must be targeted with greater attention to biodiversity protection.
7.47.519	Researchers argue that more attention to the latter solution is required.
7.47.520	Preserve Design
7.47.521	There has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity.
7.47.522	The fundamental principle behind much of the research has been the seminal theoretical work of Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson published in 1967 on island biogeography.
7.47.523	[5]
7.47.524	This work sought to understand the factors affecting biodiversity on islands.
7.47.525	The fundamental conclusion was that biodiversity on an island was a function of the origin of species through migration, speciation, and extinction on that island.
7.47.526	Islands farther from a mainland are harder to get to, so migration is lower and the equilibrium number of species is lower.
7.47.527	Within island populations, evidence suggests that the number of species gradually increases to a level similar to the numbers on the mainland from which the species is suspected to have migrated.
7.47.528	In addition, smaller islands are harder to find, so their immigration rates for new species are lower.
7.47.529	Smaller islands are also less geographically diverse so there are fewer niches to promote speciation.
7.47.530	And finally, smaller islands support smaller populations, so the probability of extinction is higher.
7.47.531	As islands get larger, the number of species accelerates, although the effect of island area on species numbers is not a direct correlation.
7.47.532	Conservation preserves can be seen as “islands” of habitat within “an ocean” of non-habitat.
7.47.533	For a species to persist in a preserve, the preserve must be large enough.
7.47.534	The critical size depends, in part, on the home range that is characteristic of the species.
7.47.535	A preserve for wolves, which range hundreds of kilometers, must be much larger than a preserve for butterflies, which might range within ten kilometers during its lifetime.
7.47.536	But larger preserves have more core area of optimal habitat for individual species, they have more niches to support more species, and they attract more species because they can be found and reached more easily.
7.47.537	Preserves perform better when there are buffer zones around them of suboptimal habitat.
7.47.538	The buffer allows organisms to exit the boundaries of the preserve without immediate negative consequences from predation or lack of resources.
7.47.539	One large preserve is better than the same area of several smaller preserves because there is more core habitat unaffected by edges.
7.47.540	For this same reason, preserves in the shape of a square or circle will be better than a preserve with many thin “arms.
7.47.541	”
7.47.542	If preserves must be smaller, then providing wildlife corridors between them so that individuals and their genes can move between the preserves, for example along rivers and streams, will make the smaller preserves behave more like a large one.
7.47.543	All of these factors are taken into consideration when planning the nature of a preserve before the land is set aside.
7.47.544	In addition to the physical, biological, and ecological specifications of a preserve, there are a variety of policy, legislative, and enforcement specifications related to uses of the preserve for functions other than protection of species.
7.47.545	These can include anything from timber extraction, mineral extraction, regulated hunting, human habitation, and nondestructive human recreation.
7.47.546	Many of these policy decisions are made based on political pressures rather than conservation considerations.
7.47.547	In some cases, wildlife protection policies have been so strict that subsistence-living indigenous populations have been forced from ancestral lands that fell within a preserve.
7.47.548	In other cases, even if a preserve is designed to protect wildlife, if the protections are not or cannot be enforced, the preserve status will have little meaning in the face of illegal poaching and timber extraction.
7.47.549	This is a widespread problem with preserves in areas of the tropics.
7.47.550	Limitations on Preserves Some of the limitations on preserves as conservation tools are evident from the discussion of preserve design.
7.47.551	Political and economic pressures typically make preserves smaller, never larger, so setting aside areas that are large enough is difficult.
7.47.552	If the area set aside is sufficiently large, there may not be sufficient area to create a buffer around the preserve.
7.47.553	In this case, an area on the outer edges of the preserve inevitably becomes a riskier suboptimal habitat for the species in the preserve.
7.47.554	Enforcement of protections is also a significant issue in countries without the resources or political will to prevent poaching and illegal resource extraction.
7.47.555	Climate change will create inevitable problems with the location of preserves.
7.47.556	The species within them will migrate to higher latitudes as the habitat of the preserve becomes less favorable.
7.47.557	Scientists are planning for the effects of global warming on future preserves and striving to predict the need for new preserves to accommodate anticipated changes to habitats; however, the end effectiveness is tenuous since these efforts are prediction based.
7.47.558	Finally, an argument can be made that conservation preserves reinforce the cultural perception that humans are separate from nature, can exist outside of it, and can only operate in ways that do damage to biodiversity.
7.47.559	Creating preserves reduces the pressure on human activities outside the preserves to be sustainable and non-damaging to biodiversity.
7.47.560	Ultimately, the political, economic, and human demographic pressures will degrade and reduce the size of conservation preserves if the activities outside them are not altered to be less damaging to biodiversity.
7.47.561	Habitat Restoration Habitat restoration holds considerable promise as a mechanism for restoring and maintaining biodiversity.
7.47.562	Of course once a species has become extinct, its restoration is impossible.
7.47.563	However, restoration can improve the biodiversity of degraded ecosystems.
7.47.564	Reintroducing wolves, a top predator, to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 led to dramatic changes in the ecosystem that increased biodiversity.
7.47.565	The wolves (Figure 47.17) function to suppress elk and coyote populations and provide more abundant resources to the guild of carrion eaters.
7.47.566	Reducing elk populations has allowed revegetation of riparian areas, which has increased the diversity of species in that habitat.
7.47.567	Decreasing the coyote population has increased the populations of species that were previously suppressed by this predator.
7.47.568	The number of species of carrion eaters has increased because of the predatory activities of the wolves.
7.47.569	In this habitat, the wolf is a keystone species, meaning a species that is instrumental in maintaining diversity in an ecosystem.
7.47.570	Removing a keystone species from an ecological community may cause a collapse in diversity.
7.47.571	The results from the Yellowstone experiment suggest that restoring a keystone species can have the effect of restoring biodiversity in the community.
7.47.572	Ecologists have argued for the identification of keystone species where possible and for focusing protection efforts on those species; likewise, it also makes sense to attempt to return them to their ecosystem if they have been removed.
7.47.573	(a)
7.47.574	The Gibbon wolf pack in Yellowstone National Park, March 1, 2007, represents a keystone species.
7.47.575	The reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park in 1995 led to a change in the grazing behavior of (b) elk.
7.47.576	To avoid predation, the elk no longer grazed exposed stream and riverbeds, such as (c) the Lamar Riverbed in Yellowstone.
7.47.577	This allowed willow and cottonwood seedlings to grow.
7.47.578	The seedlings decreased erosion and provided shading to the creek, which improved fish habitat.
7.47.579	A new colony of (d) beaver may also have benefited from the habitat change.
7.47.580	Other large-scale restoration experiments underway involve dam removal.
7.47.581	In the United States, since the mid-1980s, many aging dams are being considered for removal rather than replacement because of shifting beliefs about the ecological value of free-flowing rivers and because many dams no longer provide the benefit and functions that they did when they were first built.
7.47.582	The measured benefits of dam removal include restoration of naturally fluctuating water levels (the purpose of dams is frequently to reduce variation in river flows), which leads to increased fish diversity and improved water quality.
7.47.583	In the Pacific Northwest, dam removal projects are expected to increase populations of salmon, which is considered a keystone species because it transports key nutrients to inland ecosystems during its annual spawning migrations.
7.47.584	In other regions such as the Atlantic coast, dam removal has allowed the return of spawning anadromous fish species (species that are born in fresh water, live most of their lives in salt water, and return to fresh water to spawn).
7.47.585	Some of the largest dam removal projects have yet to occur or have happened too recently for the consequences to be measured.
7.47.586	The large-scale ecological experiments that these removal projects constitute will provide valuable data for other dam projects slated either for removal or construction.
7.47.587	The Role of Captive Breeding Zoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both through captive breeding programs and education.
7.47.588	The transformation of the missions of zoos from collection and exhibition facilities to organizations that are dedicated to conservation is ongoing.
7.47.589	In general, it has been recognized that, except in some specific targeted cases, captive breeding programs for endangered species are inefficient and often prone to failure when the species are reintroduced to the wild.
7.47.590	Zoo facilities are far too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the numbers of species that are now at risk.
7.47.591	Education is another potential positive impact of zoos on conservation efforts, particularly given the global trend to urbanization and the consequent reduction in contacts between people and wildlife.
7.47.592	A number of studies have been performed to look at the effectiveness of zoos on people’s attitudes and actions regarding conservation; at present, the results tend to be mixed.
