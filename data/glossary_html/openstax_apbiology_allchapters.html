As with mitosis, DNA replication occurs prior to meiosis during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Meiosis is a series of events that arrange and separate chromosomes and chromatids into daughter cells. During the interphases of meiosis, each chromosome is duplicated. In meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei and usually four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The first separates homologs, and the second—like mitosis—separates chromatids into individual chromosomes.

Observable traits are referred to as dominant, and non-expressed traits are described as recessive. When the offspring in Mendel’s experiment were self-crossed, the F<span class="s1">2 </span>offspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 3:1 ratio, confirming that the recessive trait had been transmitted faithfully from the original P<span class="s1">0 </span>parent. Reciprocal crosses generated identical F<span class="s1">1 </span>and F<span class="s1">2 </span>offspring ratios. By examining sample sizes, Mendel showed that his crosses behaved reproducibly according to the laws of probability, and that the traits were inherited as independent events.<br/>Two rules in probability can be used to find the expected proportions of offspring of different traits from different crosses. To find the probability of two or more independent events occurring together, apply the product rule and multiply the probabilities of the individual events. The use of the word “and” suggests the appropriate application of the product rule. To find the probability of two or more events occurring in combination, apply the sum rule and add their individual probabilities together. The use of the word “or” suggests the appropriate application of the sum rule.</p><h3>12.2 Characteristics and Traits</h3><p>When true-breeding or homozygous individuals that differ for a certain trait are crossed, all of the offspring will be heterozygotes for that trait. If the traits are inherited as dominant and recessive, the F<span class="s1">1 </span>offspring will all exhibit the same phenotype as the parent homozygous for the dominant trait. If these heterozygous offspring are self-crossed, the resulting F<span class="s1">2 </span>offspring will be equally likely to inherit gametes carrying the dominant or recessive trait, giving rise to offspring of which one quarter are homozygous dominant, half are heterozygous, and one quarter are homozygous recessive. Because homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals are phenotypically identical, the observed traits in the F<span class="s1">2 </span>offspring will exhibit a ratio of three dominant to one recessive.<br/>Alleles do not always behave in dominant and recessive patterns. Incomplete dominance describes situations in which the heterozygote exhibits a phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous phenotypes. Codominance describes the simultaneous expression of both of the alleles in the heterozygote.

Neither Mendelian genetics nor gene linkage is perfectly accurate; instead, chromosome behavior involves segregation, independent assortment, and occasionally, linkage. Sturtevant devised a method to assess recombination frequency and infer the relative positions and distances of linked genes on a chromosome on the basis of the average number of crossovers in the intervening region between the genes. Sturtevant correctly presumed that genes are arranged in serial order on chromosomes and that recombination between homologs can occur anywhere on a chromosome with equal likelihood. Whereas linkage causes alleles on the same chromosome to be inherited together, homologous recombination biases alleles toward an inheritance pattern of independent assortment.</p><p class="s1">Chapter 14 | DNA Structure and Function                                                                                                                                                                                            575</p><h1>KEY TERMS</h1><h4>electrophoresis <span class="p">technique used to separate DNA fragments according to size</span></h4><h4>helicase <span class="p">during replication, this enzyme helps to open up the DNA helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds</span></h4><h4>induced mutation <span class="p">mutation that results from exposure to chemicals or environmental agents</span></h4><h4>lagging strand   <span class="p">during replication, the strand that is replicated in short fragments and away from the replication fork</span></h4><h4>leading strand   <span class="p">strand that is synthesized continuously in the 5&#39;-3&#39;

The Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from genes to mRNA to proteins. Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the process of translation. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and three nonsense codons. Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.</p><h3>15.2 Prokaryotic Transcription</h3><p>In prokaryotes, mRNA synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the DNA template comprising two consensus sequences that recruit RNA polymerase.

Prokaryotic organisms express the entire DNA they encode in every cell, but not necessarily all at the same time. Proteins are expressed only when they are needed. Eukaryotic organisms express a subset of the DNA that is encoded in any given cell. In each cell type, the type and amount of protein is regulated by controlling gene expression. To express a protein, the DNA is first transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. In prokaryotic cells, these processes occur almost simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus and is separate from the translation that occurs in the cytoplasm. Gene expression in prokaryotes is mostly regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas in eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post- translational levels.</p><h3>16.2 Prokaryotic Gene  Regulation</h3><p>The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control. Repressive control, typified by the <i>trp </i>operon, uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase and the activation of transcription. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. Activator control, typified by the action of CAP, increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter when CAP is bound. In this case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of cAMP to CAP. CAP then binds the promoter, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter better. In the last example—the <i>lac </i>operon—two conditions must be met to initiate transcription. Glucose must not be present, and lactose must be available for the <i>lac </i>operon to be transcribed.

Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size by gel electrophoresis. Short stretches of DNA or RNA can be amplified by PCR. Southern and northern blotting can be used to detect the presence of specific short sequences in a DNA or RNA sample. The term “cloning” may refer to cloning small DNA fragments (molecular cloning), cloning cell populations (cellular cloning), or cloning entire organisms (reproductive cloning). Genetic testing is performed to identify disease-causing genes, and gene therapy is used to cure an inheritable disease.<br/>Transgenic organisms possess DNA from a different species, usually generated by molecular cloning techniques. Vaccines, antibiotics, and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA technology. Transgenic plants are usually created to improve characteristics of crop plants.</p><h3>17.2 Mapping Genomes</h3><p>Genome mapping is similar to solving a big, complicated puzzle with pieces of information coming from laboratories all over the world. Genetic maps provide an outline for the location of genes within a genome, and they estimate the distance between genes and genetic markers on the basis of recombination frequencies during meiosis. Physical maps provide detailed information about the physical distance between the genes. The most detailed information is available through sequence mapping. Information from all mapping and sequencing sources is combined to study an entire genome.</p><h3>17.3 Whole-Genome Sequencing</h3><p>Whole-genome sequencing is the latest available resource to treat genetic diseases. Some doctors are using whole-genome sequencing to save lives. Genomics has many industrial applications including biofuel development, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and pollution control. The basic principle of all modern-day sequencing strategies involves the chain termination method of sequencing.<br/>Although the human genome sequences provide key insights to medical professionals, researchers use whole-genome sequences of model organisms to better understand the genome of the species. Automation and the decreased cost of whole-genome sequencing may lead to personalized medicine in the future.</p><h3>17.4 Applying Genomics</h3><p>Imagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. Genomics is being applied to most fields of biology; it is being used for personalized medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, the study of drug interactions before the conduct of clinical trials, and the study of microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. It is also being applied to developments such as the generation of new biofuels, genealogical assessment using mitochondria,</p><p class="s1">Chapter 18 | Evolution and Origin of Species                                                                                                                                                                 747</p><h1>KEY TERMS</h1><h4>acquired characteristics  <span class="p">modifications caused by an individual’s environment that can be inherited by its offspring</span></h4><h4>adaptation <span class="p">heritable trait or behavior in an organism that aids in its survival and reproduction in its present environment</span></h4><h4>adaptive radiation   <span class="p">speciation when one species radiates out to form several other species</span></h4><h4>allopatric speciation  <span class="p">speciation that occurs via geographic separation</span></h4><h4>allopolyploid <span class="p">polyploidy formed between two related, but separate species</span></h4><h4>aneuploidy <span class="p">condition of a cell having an extra chromosome or missing a chromosome for its species</span></h4><h4>autopolyploid <span class="p">polyploidy formed within a single species</span></h4><h4>behavioral isolation  <span class="p">type of reproductive isolation that occurs when a specific behavior or lack of one  prevents reproduction from taking place</span></h4><h4>convergent evolution <span class="p">process by which groups of organisms independently evolve to similar forms</span></h4><h4>dispersal <span class="p">allopatric speciation that occurs when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area</span></h4><h4>divergent evolution <span class="p">process by which groups of organisms evolve in diverse directions from a common point</span></h4><h4>gametic barrier  <span class="p">prezygotic barrier occurring when closely related individuals of different species mate, but differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking place</span></h4><h4>gradual  speciation model <span class="p">model that shows how species diverge gradually over time in small steps</span></h4><h4>habitat isolation <span class="p">reproductive isolation resulting when populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat, taking up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species</span></h4><h4>homologous structures <span class="p">parallel structures in diverse organisms that have a common ancestor</span></h4><h4>hybrid  <span class="p">offspring of two closely related individuals, not of the same species</span></h4><h4>hybrid zone <span class="p">area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids</span></h4><h4>natural selection <span class="p">reproduction of individuals with favorable genetic traits that survive environmental change because of those traits, leading to evolutionary change</span></h4><h4>polyploidy <span class="p">gametes with extra chromosomes</span></h4><h4>postzygotic barrier  <span class="p">reproductive isolation mechanism that occurs after zygote formation</span></h4><h4>prezygotic barrier  <span class="p">reproductive isolation mechanism that occurs before zygote formation</span></h4><h4>punctuated equilibrium <span class="p">model for rapid speciation that can occur when an event causes a small portion of a population to be cut off from the rest of the population</span></h4><h4>reinforcement <span class="p">continued speciation divergence between two related species due to low fitness of hybrids between them</span></h4><h4>reproductive isolation  <span class="p">situation that occurs when a species is reproductively independent from other species;

Over time, organisms evolve more characteristics that are beneficial to their survival. For living organisms to adapt and change to environmental pressures, genetic variation must be present. With genetic variation, individuals have differences in form and function that allow some to survive certain conditions better than others. These organisms pass their favorable traits to their offspring. Eventually, environments change, and what was once a desirable, advantageous trait may become an undesirable trait and organisms may further evolve. Evolution may be convergent with similar traits evolving in multiple species or divergent with diverse traits evolving in multiple species that came from a common ancestor. Evidence of evolution can be observed by means of DNA code and the fossil record, and also by the existence of homologous and vestigial structures.</p><h3>18.2 Formation of New Species</h3><p>Speciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic separation (allopatric speciation) and through mechanisms that occur within a shared habitat (sympatric speciation). Both pathways isolate a population reproductively in some form. Mechanisms of reproductive isolation act as barriers between closely related species, enabling them to diverge and exist as genetically independent species. Prezygotic barriers block reproduction prior to formation of a zygote, whereas<br/>postzygotic barriers block reproduction after fertilization occurs. For a new species to develop, something must cause a breach in the reproductive barriers. Sympatric speciation can occur through errors in meiosis that form gametes with extra chromosomes (polyploidy). Autopolyploidy occurs within a single species, whereas allopolyploidy occurs between closely related species.</p><h3>18.3 Reconnection and Rates of Speciation</h3><p>Speciation is not a precise division: overlap between closely related species can occur in areas called hybrid zones. Organisms reproduce with other similar organisms. The fitness of these hybrid offspring can affect the evolutionary path<br/>of the two species. Scientists propose two models for the rate of speciation: one model illustrates how a species can change slowly over time; the other model demonstrates how change can occur quickly from a parent generation to a new species. Both models continue to follow the patterns of natural selection.</p><h2>REVIEW QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. <span class="p">Which scientific concept did Charles Darwin and Alfred</span></h4><p>Wallace independently discover?<br/>a.   mutation<br/>b.   natural selection c.   overbreeding<br/>d.   sexual reproduction</p><h4>2. <span class="p">Which of these statements about a natural principle that points to the inevitability of natural selection is false?</span></h4><p>a.

evolution and heredity, along with the more modern study of population genetics. It describes the evolution of populations and species, from small-scale changes among individuals to large-scale changes over paleontological time periods. To understand how organisms evolve, scientists can track populations’ allele frequencies over time. If they differ from generation to generation, scientists can conclude that the population is not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and is thus evolving.</p><h3>19.2 Population Genetics</h3><p>Both genetic and environmental factors can cause phenotypic variation in a population. Different alleles can confer different phenotypes, and different environments can also cause individuals to look or act differently. Only those differences encoded in an individual’s genes, however, can be passed to its offspring and, thus, be a target of natural selection. Natural selection works by selecting for alleles that confer beneficial traits or behaviors, while selecting against those for deleterious qualities. Genetic drift stems from the chance occurrence that some individuals in the germ line have more offspring than others. When individuals leave or join the population, allele frequencies can change as a result of gene flow. Mutations to an individual’s DNA may introduce new variation into a population. Allele frequencies can also be altered when individuals do not randomly mate with others in the group.</p><h3>19.3 Adaptive Evolution</h3><p>Because natural selection acts to increase the frequency of beneficial alleles and traits while decreasing the frequency of deleterious qualities, it is adaptive evolution. Natural selection acts at the level of the individual, selecting for those that have a higher overall fitness compared to the rest of the population. If the fit phenotypes are those that are similar, natural selection will result in stabilizing selection, and an overall decrease in the population’s variation. Directional selection works to shift a population’s variance toward a new, fit phenotype, as environmental conditions change. In contrast, diversifying selection results in increased genetic variance by selecting for two or more distinct phenotypes.<br/>Other types of selection include frequency-dependent selection, in which individuals with either common (positive frequency-dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependent selection) are selected for. Finally, sexual selection results from the fact that one sex has more variance in the reproductive success than the other.

It is made up of elements. All of the 98 elements that occur naturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various ways to create molecules, which in turn combine to form cells, tissues, organ systems, and organisms. Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest units of an element that retain all of the properties of that element. Electrons can be transferred, shared, or cause charge disparities between atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals interactions.</p><h3>2.2 Water</h3><p>Water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life. It is a polar molecule, allowing for the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an excellent solvent.

Each group of organisms went through its own evolutionary journey, called its phylogeny. Each organism shares relatedness with others, and based on morphologic and genetic evidence, scientists attempt to map the evolutionary pathways of all life on Earth. Historically, organisms were organized into a taxonomic classification system. However, today many scientists build phylogenetic trees to illustrate evolutionary relationships.</p><h3>20.2 Determining Evolutionary Relationships</h3><p>To build phylogenetic trees, scientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make evolutionary connections between organisms. Using morphologic and molecular data, scientists work to identify homologous characteristics and genes. Similarities between organisms can stem either from shared evolutionary history (homologies) or from separate evolutionary paths (analogies). Newer technologies can be used to help distinguish homologies from analogies. After homologous information is identified, scientists use cladistics to organize these events as a means to determine an evolutionary timeline. Scientists apply the concept of maximum parsimony, which states that the order of events probably occurred in the most obvious and simple way with the least amount of steps. For evolutionary events, this would be the path with the least number of major divergences that correlate with the evidence.</p><h3>20.3 Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree</h3><p>The phylogenetic tree, first used by Darwin, is the classic “tree of life” model describing phylogenetic relationships among species, and the most common model used today. New ideas about HGT and genome fusion have caused some to suggest revising the model to resemble webs or rings.</p><h2>REVIEW QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. <span class="p">Who devised a commonly used classification system?</span></h4><p>a.

microscope. Their genomes contain either DNA or RNA—never both—and they replicate using the replication proteins of a host cell. Viruses are diverse, infecting archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Viruses consist of a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein capsid with or without an outer lipid envelope. The capsid shape, presence of an envelope, and core composition dictate some elements of the classification of viruses. The most commonly used classification method, the Baltimore classification, categorizes viruses based on how they produce their mRNA.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6">This OpenStax

animals appeared. Hot springs and hydrothermal vents may<br/>have been the environments in which life began. Microbial mats are thought to represent the earliest forms of life on Earth, and there is fossil evidence of their presence about 3.5 billion years ago. A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes that grows at interfaces between different types of material, mostly on moist surfaces. During the first 2 billion years, the atmosphere was anoxic and only anaerobic organisms were able to live.

The shoot system includes the aboveground vegetative portions (stems and leaves) and reproductive parts (flowers and fruits). The root system supports the plant and is usually underground. A plant is composed of two main types of tissue: meristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells found in root and shoot tips. As growth occurs, meristematic tissue differentiates into permanent tissue, which is categorized as either simple or complex. Simple tissues are made up of similar cell types; examples include dermal tissue and ground tissue. Dermal tissue provides the outer covering of the<br/>plant. Ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis; it also supports vascular tissue and may store water and sugars. Complex tissues are made up of different cell types. Vascular tissue, for example, is made up of xylem and phloem cells.</p><h3>23.2 Stems</h3><p>The stem of a plant bears the leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are characterized by the presence of nodes (the points of attachment for leaves or branches) and internodes (regions between nodes).<br/>Plant organs are made up of simple and complex tissues. The stem has three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. Dermal tissue is the outer covering of the plant. It contains epidermal cells, stomata, guard cells, and trichomes. Vascular tissue is made up of xylem and phloem tissues and conducts water, minerals, and photosynthetic products. Ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis and support and is composed of parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells.<br/>Primary growth occurs at the tips of roots and shoots, causing an increase in length. Woody plants may also exhibit secondary growth, or increase in thickness. In woody plants, especially trees, annual rings may form as growth slows at the end of each season. Some plant species have modified stems that help to store food, propagate new plants, or discourage predators. Rhizomes, corms, stolons, runners, tubers, bulbs, tendrils, and thorns are examples of modified stems.</p><h3>23.3 Roots</h3><p>Roots help to anchor a plant, absorb water and minerals, and serve as storage sites for food. Taproots and fibrous roots are the two main types of root systems. In a taproot system, a main root grows vertically downward with a few lateral roots. Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem, where a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is shallower than a taproot. The growing root tip is protected by a root cap. The root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell division (cells are actively dividing), a zone of elongation (cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells differentiate to form different kinds of cells). Root vascular tissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. In some habitats, the roots of certain plants may be modified to form aerial roots or epiphytic roots.</p><h3>23.4 Leaves</h3><p>Leaves are the main site of photosynthesis. A typical leaf consists of a lamina (the broad part of the leaf, also called the blade) and a petiole (the stalk that attaches the leaf to a stem). The arrangement of leaves on a stem, known as phyllotaxy, enables maximum exposure to sunlight. Each plant species has a characteristic leaf arrangement and form. The pattern of leaf arrangement may be alternate, opposite, or spiral, while leaf form may be simple or compound. Leaf tissue consists of the epidermis, which forms the outermost cell layer, and mesophyll and vascular tissue, which make up the inner portion<br/>of the leaf. In some plant species, leaf form is modified to form structures such as tendrils, spines, bud scales, and needles.</p><h3>23.5 Transport  of Water and Solutes in Plants</h3><p>Water potential (Ψ) is a measure of the difference in potential energy between a water sample and pure water.

Limits on animal size and shape include impacts to their movement. Diffusion affects their size and development. Bioenergetics describes how animals use and obtain energy in relation to their body size, activity level, and environment.</p><h3>24.2 Animal Primary Tissues</h3><p>The basic building blocks of complex animals are four primary tissues. These are combined to form organs, which have a specific, specialized function within the body, such as the skin or kidney. Organs are organized together to perform common functions in the form of systems.

It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the systems encounter. It is in equilibrium because body functions are kept within a normal range, with some fluctuations around a set point for the processes.</p><h2>REVIEW QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. <span class="p">The pleural cavity is part of which cavity?</span></h4><p>a.   dorsal<br/>b.   thoracic<br/>c.   abdominal d.   pericardial<br/><b>2. </b>A plane that divides an animal into dorsal and ventral portions is the <u>       </u> plane.<br/>a.   sagittal<br/>b.   midsagittal c.   frontal<br/>d.   transverse</p><h4>3. <span class="p">What is the term for a hard covering or shell that provides protection and muscle attachment?</span></h4><p>a.   apodeme b.   fusiform<br/>c.   exoskeleton d.   endotherm</p><h4>4. <span class="p">Which organism has a fusiform shape?</span></h4><p>a.   elephant b.   dolphin c.   spider<br/>d.   human</p><p class="s1">1090                                                                                                                                                                 Chapter 25 | Animal Nutrition and the Digestive  System</p><h1>KEY TERMS</h1><h4>alimentary canal   <span class="p">tubular digestive system with a mouth and anus</span></h4><h4>aminopeptidase <span class="p">protease that breaks down peptides to single amino acids;

Neurons are specialized cells that are capable of sending electrical as well as chemical signals. Most neurons contain dendrites, which receive these signals, and axons that send signals to other neurons or tissues. There are four main types of neurons: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar neurons. Glia are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support neuronal development and signaling. There are several types of glia that serve different functions.</p><h3>26.2 How Neurons Communicate</h3><p>Neurons have charged membranes because there are different concentrations of ions inside and outside of the cell. Voltage- gated ion channels control the movement of ions into and out of a neuron. When a neuronal membrane is depolarized to at least the threshold of excitation, an action potential is fired. The action potential is then propagated along a myelinated<br/>axon to the axon terminals. In a chemical synapse, the action potential causes release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. Through binding to postsynaptic receptors, the neurotransmitter can cause excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing, respectively, the postsynaptic membrane. In electrical synapses, the action potential is directly communicated to the postsynaptic cell through gap junctions—large channel<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6</a></p><p class="s1">1196                                                                                                                                                                                                             Chapter 27 | Sensory Systems</p><h1>KEY TERMS</h1><h4>audition <span class="p">sense of hearing</span></h4><h4>basilar  membrane <span class="p">stiff structure in the cochlea that indirectly anchors auditory receptors</span></h4><h4>bipolar neuron <span class="p">neuron with two processes from the cell body, typically in opposite directions</span></h4><h4>candela <span class="p">(cd) unit of measurement of luminous intensity (brightness)</span></h4><h4>circadian <span class="p">describes a time cycle about one day in length</span></h4><h4>cochlea <span class="p">whorled structure that contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal</span></h4><h4>cone <span class="p">weakly photosensitive, chromatic, cone-shaped neuron in the fovea of the retina that detects bright light and is used in daytime color vision</span></h4><h4>cornea <span class="p">transparent layer over the front of the eye that helps focus light waves</span></h4><h4>fovea <span class="p">region in the center of the retina with a high density of photoreceptors and which is responsible for acute vision</span></h4><h4>free nerve  ending <span class="p">ending of an afferent neuron that lacks a specialized structure for detection of sensory stimuli;

Perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain function. Humans have special senses: olfaction, gustation, equilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of somatosensation.<br/>Sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons that are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are used to receive information about the environment (internal or external). Each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it detects. For example, neither gustatory receptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. Each sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in space, which is known as that receptor’s receptive field. The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system.<br/>All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, enter the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to processing that particular sense.</p><h3>27.2 Somatosensation</h3><p>Somatosensation includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous membranes, as well as from the limbs and joints. Somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior locations as well, and a variety of receptor types, embedded in the skin and mucous membranes, play a role.<br/>There are several types of specialized sensory receptors. Rapidly adapting free nerve endings detect nociception, hot and cold, and light touch. Slowly adapting, encapsulated Merkel’s disks are found in fingertips and lips, and respond to light touch. Meissner’s corpuscles, found in glabrous skin, are rapidly adapting, encapsulated receptors that detect touch, low- frequency vibration, and flutter. Ruffini endings are slowly adapting, encapsulated receptors that detect skin stretch, joint activity, and warmth. Hair receptors are rapidly adapting nerve endings wrapped around the base of hair follicles that detect hair movement and skin deflection. Finally, Pacinian corpuscles are encapsulated, rapidly adapting receptors that<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6</a></p><p class="s1">1240                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 28 | The Endocrine System</p><h1>KEY TERMS</h1><h4>acromegaly <span class="p">condition caused by overproduction of GH in adults</span></h4><h4>Addison’s disease <span class="p">disorder caused by the hyposecretion of corticosteroids</span></h4><h4>adenylate cyclase  <span class="p">an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP</span></h4><h4>adrenal  cortex <span class="p">outer portion of adrenal glands that produces corticosteroids</span></h4><h4>adrenal  gland   <span class="p">endocrine glands associated with the kidneys</span></h4><h4>adrenal  medulla <span class="p">inner portion of adrenal glands that produces epinephrine and norepinephrine</span></h4><h4>adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) <span class="p">hormone released by the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the adrenal cortex to release corticosteroids during the long-term stress response</span></h4><p><b>aldosterone </b>steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that stimulates the reabsorption of Na<span class="s1">+ </span>from extracellular fluids and secretion of K<span class="s1">+</span>.</p><h4>alpha cell  <span class="p">endocrine cell of the pancreatic islets that produces the hormone glucagon</span></h4><h4>amino  acid-derived hormone <span class="p">hormone derived from amino acids</span></h4><h4>androgen <span class="p">male sex hormone such as testosterone</span></h4><h4>anterior pituitary  <span class="p">portion of the pituitary gland that produces six hormones;

In mammals, air is warmed and humidified in the nasal cavity. Air then travels down the pharynx, through the trachea, and into the lungs. In the lungs, air passes through the branching bronchi, reaching the respiratory bronchioles, which house the first site of gas exchange. The respiratory bronchioles open into the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. Because there are so many alveoli and alveolar sacs in the lung, the surface area for gas exchange is very large. Several protective mechanisms are in place to prevent damage or infection. These include the hair and mucus in the nasal cavity that trap dust, dirt, and other particulate matter before they can enter the system. In the lungs, particles are trapped in a mucus layer and transported via cilia up to the esophageal opening at the top of the trachea to be swallowed.</p><h3>30.2 Gas Exchange across  Respiratory Surfaces</h3><p>The lungs can hold a large volume of air, but they are not usually filled to maximal capacity. Lung volume measurements include tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory reserve volume, and residual volume. The sum of these equals the total lung capacity. Gas movement into or out of the lungs is dependent on the pressure of the gas. Air is a mixture of gases; therefore, the partial pressure of each gas can be calculated to determine how the gas will flow in the lung. The difference between the partial pressure of the gas in the air drives oxygen into the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.</p><h3>30.3 Breathing</h3><p>The structure of the lungs and thoracic cavity control the mechanics of breathing. Upon inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and lowers. The intercostal muscles contract and expand the chest wall outward. The intrapleural pressure drops, the lungs expand, and air is drawn into the airways. When exhaling, the intercostal muscles and diaphragm relax, returning the intrapleural pressure back to the resting state. The lungs recoil and airways close. The air passively exits the lung.<br/>There is high surface tension at the air-airway interface in the lung. Surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins, acts like a detergent in the airways to reduce surface tension and allow for opening of the alveoli.<br/>Breathing and gas exchange are both altered by changes in the compliance and resistance of the lung. If the compliance of the lung decreases, as occurs in restrictive diseases like fibrosis, the airways stiffen and collapse upon exhalation. Air becomes trapped in the lungs, making breathing more difficult. If resistance increases, as happens with asthma or emphysema, the airways become obstructed, trapping air in the lungs and causing breathing to become difficult. Alterations in the ventilation of the airways or perfusion of the arteries can affect gas exchange. These changes in ventilation and perfusion, called V/Q mismatch, can arise from anatomical or physiological changes.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6</a></p><p class="s1">Chapter 31 | The Circulatory  System                                                                                                                                                                             1377</p><h1>KEY TERMS</h1><h4>angina <span class="p">pain caused by partial blockage of the coronary arteries by the buildup of plaque and lack of oxygen to the heart muscle</span></h4><h4>aorta  <span class="p">major artery of the body that takes blood away from the heart</span></h4><h4>arteriole   <span class="p">small vessel that connects an artery to a capillary bed</span></h4><h4>artery  <span class="p">blood vessel that takes blood away from the heart</span></h4><h4>atherosclerosis <span class="p">buildup of fatty plaques in the coronary arteries in the heart</span></h4><h4>atrioventricular valve   <span class="p">one-way membranous flap of connective tissue between the atrium and the ventricle in the right side of the heart;

Some primitive animals use diffusion for the exchange of water, nutrients, and gases. However, complex organisms use the circulatory system to carry gases, nutrients, and waste through the body. Circulatory systems may be open (mixed with the interstitial fluid) or closed (separated from the interstitial fluid). Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptions during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. Fish have a two-chambered heart with unidirectional circulation. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart, which has some mixing of the blood, and they have double circulation. Most non-avian reptiles have a three-chambered heart, but have little mixing of the blood; they have double circulation. Mammals and birds have a four-chambered heart with no mixing of the blood and double circulation.</p><h3>31.2 Components of the Blood</h3><p>Specific components of the blood include red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and the plasma, which contains coagulation factors and serum. Blood is important for regulation of the body’s pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, the circulation of nutrients and removal of waste, the distribution of hormones from endocrine glands, and the elimination of excess heat; it also contains components for blood clotting. Red blood cells are specialized cells that contain hemoglobin and circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells. White blood cells are involved in the immune response to identify and target invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms; they also recycle waste components, such as old red blood cells. Platelets and blood clotting factors cause the change of the soluble protein fibrinogen to the insoluble protein fibrin at a wound site forming a plug. Plasma consists of 90 percent water along with various substances, such as coagulation factors and antibodies. The serum is the plasma component of the blood without the coagulation factors.</p><h3>31.3 Mammalian Heart and Blood Vessels</h3><p>The heart muscle pumps blood through three divisions of the circulatory system: coronary, pulmonary, and systemic. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The pumping of the heart is a function of cardiomyocytes, distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle. The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial node, which is located near the wall of the right atrium. Electrical charges pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison; then the pulse reaches the atrioventricular node between the right atrium and right ventricle. A pause in the electric signal<br/>allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels; arteries take blood away from the heart, and veins bring blood back to the heart.</p><h3>31.4 Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Regulation</h3><p>Blood primarily moves through the body by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. Blood is prevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves. Blood flow through the capillary beds is controlled by precapillary sphincters to increase and decrease flow depending on the body’s needs and is directed by nerve and hormone signals. Lymph vessels take fluid that has leaked out of the blood<br/>to the lymph nodes where it is cleaned before returning to the heart. During systole, blood enters the arteries, and the artery walls stretch to accommodate the extra blood. During diastole, the artery walls return to normal. The blood pressure of the systole phase and the diastole phase gives the two pressure readings for blood pressure.</p><p class="s1">Chapter 32 | Osmotic  Regulation and Excretion                                                                                                                                                                                1417</p><h1>KEY TERMS</h1><h4>afferent  arteriole   <span class="p">arteriole that branches from the cortical radiate artery and enters the glomerulus</span></h4><h4>ammonia <span class="p">compound made of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms</span></h4><h4>ammonotelic <span class="p">describes an animal that excretes ammonia as the primary waste material</span></h4><h4>angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)  <span class="p">enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II</span></h4><h4>angiotensin I  <span class="p">product in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway</span></h4><h4>angiotensin II  <span class="p">molecule that affects different organs to increase blood pressure</span></h4><h4>anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) <span class="p">hormone that prevents the loss of water</span></h4><h4>antioxidant <span class="p">agent that prevents cell destruction by reactive oxygen species</span></h4><h4>arcuate artery  <span class="p">artery that branches from the interlobar artery and arches over the base of the renal pyramids</span></h4><h4>ascending limb  <span class="p">part of the loop of Henle that ascends from the renal medulla to the renal cortex</span></h4><h4>blood urea nitrogen (BUN)  <span class="p">estimate of urea in the blood and an indicator of kidney function</span></h4><h4>Bowman&#39;s capsule  <span class="p">structure that encloses the glomerulus</span></h4><h4>calyx   <span class="p">structure that connects the renal pelvis to the renal medulla</span></h4><h4>cortex (animal)  <span class="p">outer layer of an organ like the kidney or adrenal gland</span></h4><h4>cortical nephron <span class="p">nephron that lies in the renal cortex</span></h4><h4>cortical radiate artery  <span class="p">artery that radiates from the arcuate arteries into the renal cortex</span></h4><h4>countercurrent exchanger  <span class="p">peritubular capillary network that allows exchange of solutes and water from the  renal tubules</span></h4><h4>countercurrent multiplier  <span class="p">osmotic gradient in the renal medulla that is responsible for concentration of urine</span></h4><h4>descending limb  <span class="p">part of the loop of Henle that descends from the renal cortex into the renal medulla</span></h4><h4>distal  convoluted tubule  (DCT) <span class="p">part of the renal tubule that is the most distant from the glomerulus</span></h4><h4>efferent arteriole   <span class="p">arteriole that exits from the glomerulus</span></h4><h4>electrolyte <span class="p">solute that breaks down into ions when dissolved in water</span></h4><h4>flame cell  <span class="p">(also, protonephridia) excretory cell found in flatworms</span></h4><h4>glomerular filtration  <span class="p">filtration of blood in the glomerular capillary network into the glomerulus</span></h4><h4>glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  <span class="p">amount of filtrate formed by the glomerulus per minute</span></h4><h4>glomerulus (renal)  <span class="p">part of the renal corpuscle that contains the capillary network</span></h4><h4>hilum  <span class="p">region in the renal pelvis where blood vessels, nerves, and ureters bunch before entering or exiting the kidney</span></h4><h4>inferior vena  cava   <span class="p">one of the main veins in the human body</span></h4><h4>interlobar  artery  <span class="p">artery that branches from the segmental artery and travels in between the renal lobes</span></h4><h4>juxtaglomerular cell  <span class="p">cell in the afferent and efferent arterioles that responds to stimuli from the macula densa</span></h4><h4>juxtamedullary nephron  <span class="p">nephron that lies in the cortex but close to the renal medulla</span></h4><p class="s1">1418                                                                                                                                                                               Chapter 32 | Osmotic  Regulation and Excretion</p><h4>kidney   <span class="p">organ that performs excretory and osmoregulatory functions</span></h4><h4>lobes of the kidney   <span class="p">renal pyramid along with the adjoining cortical region</span></h4><h4>loop  of Henle  <span class="p">part of the renal tubule that loops into the renal medulla</span></h4><h4>macula densa  <span class="p">group of cells that senses changes in sodium ion concentration;

It is the number of solute molecules and not the molecular size that is important in osmosis. Osmoregulation and osmotic balance are important bodily functions, resulting in water and salt balance. Not all solutes can pass through a semi-permeable membrane. Osmosis is the movement of water across the membrane. Osmosis occurs to equalize the number of solute molecules across a semi-permeable membrane by the movement of water to the side of higher solute concentration. Facilitated diffusion utilizes protein channels to move solute molecules from areas of higher to lower concentration while active transport mechanisms are required to move solutes against concentration gradients. Osmolarity is measured in units of milliequivalents or milliosmoles, both of which take into consideration the number of solute particles and the charge on them. Fish that live in fresh water or saltwater adapt by being osmoregulators or osmoconformers.</p><h3>32.2 The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs</h3><p>The kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems; they function to filter blood and maintain the osmolarity of body fluids at 300 mOsm. They are surrounded by three layers and are made up internally of three distinct regions—the cortex, medulla, and pelvis.<br/>The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. The renal arteries branch out from the aorta and enter the kidney where they further divide into segmental, interlobar, arcuate, and cortical radiate arteries.<br/>The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively filters blood and generates urine. The nephron is made up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule. Cortical nephrons are found in the renal cortex, while juxtamedullary nephrons are found in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. The nephron filters and exchanges water and solutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue fluid in the kidneys.<br/>There are three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular filtration, which occurs in the glomerulus; tubular reabsorption, which occurs in the renal tubules; and tubular secretion, which also occurs in the renal tubules.</p><p class="s1">Chapter 33 | The Immune  System                                                                                                                                                                                 1471</p><h1>KEY TERMS</h1><h4>adaptive immunity   <span class="p">immunity that has memory and occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen  or a vaccination</span></h4><h4>affinity  <span class="p">attraction of molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules</span></h4><h4>allergy   <span class="p">immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen</span></h4><h4>antibody <span class="p">protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen;

Using a combination of cellular and molecular attacks, the innate immune system identifies the nature of a pathogen and responds with inflammation, phagocytosis, cytokine release, destruction by NK cells, and/or a complement system. When innate mechanisms are insufficient to clear an infection, the adaptive immune response is informed and mobilized.</p><h3>33.2 Adaptive Immune Response</h3><p>The adaptive immune response is a slower-acting, longer-lasting, and more specific response than the innate response. However, the adaptive response requires information from the innate immune system to function. APCs display antigens via MHC molecules to complementary naïve T cells. In response, the T cells differentiate and proliferate, becoming T<span class="s1">H </span>cells or CTLs. T<span class="s1">H </span>cells stimulate B cells that have engulfed and presented pathogen-derived antigens. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, whereas CTLs induce apoptosis in intracellularly infected or cancerous cells.<br/>Memory cells persist after a primary exposure to a pathogen. If re-exposure occurs, memory cells differentiate into effector cells without input from the innate immune system. The mucosal immune system is largely independent from the systemic immune system but functions in a parallel fashion to protect the extensive mucosal surfaces of the body.</p><h3>33.3 Antibodies</h3><p>Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are the molecules secreted from plasma cells that mediate the humoral immune response. There are five antibody classes; an antibody&#39;s class determines its mechanism of action and production site but does not control its binding specificity. Antibodies bind antigens via variable domains and can either neutralize pathogens or mark them for phagocytosis or activate the complement cascade.</p><h3>33.4 Disruptions in the Immune System</h3><p>Immune disruptions may involve insufficient immune responses or inappropriate immune targets. Immunodeficiency increases an individual&#39;s susceptibility to infections and cancers. Hypersensitivities are misdirected responses either to harmless foreign particles, as in the case of allergies, or to host factors, as in the case of autoimmunity. Reactions to self components may be the result of molecular mimicry.</p><h2>REVIEW QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. <span class="p">What is the mechanism that skin uses to protect against diseases caused by organisms?</span></h4><p>a.   high pH<br/>b.   mucus c.   tears<br/>d.   desiccation</p><h4>2. <span class="p">How does the human body use a chemical barrier as part of the innate immune response?</span></h4><p>a.

Asexual reproduction occurs through fission, budding, and fragmentation. Sexual reproduction may mean the joining of sperm and eggs within animalsâ€™ bodies or it may mean the release of sperm and eggs into the environment. An individual may be one sex, or both; it may start out as one sex and switch during its life, or it may stay male or female.</p><h3>34.2 Fertilization</h3><p>Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur either outside the bodies or inside the female. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Once fertilized, the eggs can develop inside the female or outside. If the egg develops outside the body, it usually has a protective covering over it. Animal anatomy evolved various ways to fertilize, hold, or expel the egg. The method of fertilization varies among animals. Some species release the egg and sperm into the environment, some species retain the egg and receive the sperm into the female body and then expel the developing embryo covered with shell, while still other species retain the developing offspring through the gestation period.</p><h3>34.3 Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis</h3><p>As animals became more complex, specific organs and organ systems developed to support specific functions for the organism. The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the growth and development of offspring. Processes developed to produce reproductive cells that had exactly half the number of chromosomes of each parent so that new combinations would have the appropriate amount of genetic material. Gametogenesis, the production of sperm (spermatogenesis) and eggs (oogenesis), takes place through the process of meiosis.</p><h3>34.4 Hormonal  Control of Human Reproduction</h3><p>The male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by hormones released from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary as well as hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. The hypothalamus monitors the need for the FSH and LH hormones made and released from the anterior pituitary. FSH and LH affect reproductive structures to cause the formation of sperm and the preparation of eggs for release and possible fertilization. In the male, FSH and LH stimulate Sertoli cells and interstitial cells of Leydig in the testes to facilitate sperm production. The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which also is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of males. In females, FSH and LH cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced. They regulate the female reproductive system which is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle. Menopause occurs when the ovaries lose their sensitivity to FSH and LH and the female reproductive cycles slow to a stop.</p><h3>34.5 Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development</h3><p>The early stages of embryonic development begin with fertilization. The process of fertilization is tightly controlled to ensure that only one sperm fuses with one egg. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes cleavage to form the blastula. The blastula, which in some species is a hollow ball of cells, undergoes a process called gastrulation, in which the three germ layers form. The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermal skin cells, the mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body, and the endoderm gives rise to columnar cells and internal organs.</p><h3>34.6 Organogenesis and Vertebrate  Formation</h3><p>Organogenesis is the formation of organs from the germ layers. Each germ layer gives rise to specific tissue types.

Ecologists ask questions across four levels of biological organization—organismal, population, community, and ecosystem. At the organismal level, ecologists study individual organisms and how they interact with their environments. At the population and community levels, ecologists explore, respectively, how a population of organisms changes over time and the ways in which that population interacts with other species in the community. Ecologists studying an ecosystem examine the living species (the biotic components) of the ecosystem as well as the nonliving portions (the abiotic components), such as air, water, and soil, of the environment.</p><h3>35.2 Biogeography</h3><p>Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution. Endemic species are species that are naturally found only in a specific geographic area. The distribution of living things is influenced by several environmental factors that are, in part, controlled by the latitude or elevation at which an organism is found. Ocean upwelling and spring and fall turnovers are important processes regulating the distribution of nutrients and other abiotic factors important in aquatic ecosystems. Energy sources, temperature, water, inorganic<br/>nutrients, and soil are factors limiting the distribution of living things in terrestrial systems. Net primary productivity is a measure of the amount of biomass produced by a biome.</p><h3>35.3 Terrestrial Biomes</h3><p>The Earth has terrestrial biomes and aquatic biomes. Aquatic biomes include both freshwater and marine environments. There are eight major terrestrial biomes: tropical wet forests, savannas, subtropical deserts, chaparral, temperate grasslands, temperate forests, boreal forests, and Arctic tundra. The same biome can occur in different geographic<br/>locations with similar climates. Temperature and precipitation, and variations in both, are key abiotic factors that shape the composition of animal and plant communities in terrestrial biomes.

Different ways of modeling ecosystems are necessary to understand how environmental disturbances will affect ecosystem structure and dynamics. Conceptual models are useful<br/>to show the general relationships between organisms and the flow of materials or energy between them. Analytical models are used to describe linear food chains, and simulation models work best with holistic food webs.</p><h3>37.2 Energy  Flow through Ecosystems</h3><p>Organisms in an ecosystem acquire energy in a variety of ways, which is transferred between trophic levels as the energy flows from the bottom to the top of the food web, with energy being lost at each transfer. The efficiency of these transfers is important for understanding the different behaviors and eating habits of warm-blooded versus cold-blooded animals. Modeling of ecosystem energy is best done with ecological pyramids of energy, although other ecological pyramids provide other vital information about ecosystem structure.</p><h3>37.3 Biogeochemical Cycles</h3><p>Mineral nutrients are cycled through ecosystems and their environment. Of particular importance are water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. All of these cycles have major impacts on ecosystem structure and function. As human activities have caused major disturbances to these cycles, their study and modeling is especially important.

These measurements include numbers of species, genetic diversity, chemical diversity, and ecosystem diversity. The number of described species is estimated to be 1.5 million with about 17,000 new species being described each year. Estimates for the total number of species on Earth vary but are on the order of 10 million. Biodiversity is negatively correlated with latitude for most taxa, meaning that biodiversity is higher in the tropics. The mechanism for this pattern is not known with certainty, but several plausible hypotheses have been advanced.<br/>Five mass extinctions with losses of more than 50 percent of extant species are observable in the fossil record. Biodiversity recovery times after mass extinctions vary, but have been up to 30 million years. Recent extinctions are recorded in written history and are the basis for one method of estimating contemporary extinction rates.

The plasma membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with each other. The landscape of the membrane is studded with proteins, some of which span the membrane. Some of these proteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing surface of the membrane, forming complexes that function to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid nature of the membrane is due to temperature, the configuration of the fatty acid tails (some kinked by double bonds), the presence of cholesterol embedded in the membrane, and the mosaic nature of the proteins and protein-carbohydrate combinations, which are not firmly fixed in place. Plasma membranes enclose and define the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux.</p><h3>5.2 Passive Transport</h3><p>The passive forms of transport, diffusion and osmosis, move materials of small molecular weight across membranes. Substances diffuse from areas of high concentration to areas of lower concentration, and this process continues until the substance is evenly distributed in a system. In solutions containing more than one substance, each type of molecule diffuses according to its own concentration gradient, independent of the diffusion of other substances. Many factors can affect the rate of diffusion, including concentration gradient, size of the particles that are diffusing, temperature of the system, and so on.<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6</a></p><p class="s1">268                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Chapter 6 | Metabolism</p><h1>KEY TERMS</h1><h4>activation energy  <span class="p">energy necessary for reactions to occur</span></h4><h4>active site   <span class="p">specific region of the enzyme to which the substrate binds</span></h4><h4>allosteric inhibition <span class="p">inhibition by a binding event at a site different from the active site, which induces a conformational change and reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate</span></h4><h4>anabolic <span class="p">(also, anabolism) pathways that require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones</span></h4><h4>ATP  <span class="p">adenosine triphosphate, the cell’s energy currency</span></h4><h4>bioenergetics <span class="p">study of energy flowing through living systems</span></h4><h4>catabolic <span class="p">(also, catabolism) pathways in which complex molecules are broken down into simpler ones</span></h4><h4>chemical energy <span class="p">potential energy in chemical bonds that is released when those bonds are broken</span></h4><h4>coenzyme <span class="p">small organic molecule, such as a vitamin or its derivative, which is required to enhance the activity of an enzyme</span></h4><h4>cofactor <span class="p">inorganic ion, such as iron and magnesium ions, required for optimal regulation of enzyme activity</span></h4><h4>competitive inhibition <span class="p">type of inhibition in which the inhibitor competes with the substrate molecule by binding to the active site of the enzyme</span></h4><h4>denature <span class="p">process that changes the natural properties of a substance</span></h4><h4>endergonic <span class="p">describes chemical reactions that require energy input</span></h4><h4>enthalpy <span class="p">total energy of a system</span></h4><h4>entropy (S)  <span class="p">measure of randomness or disorder within a system</span></h4><h4>exergonic <span class="p">describes chemical reactions that release free energy</span></h4><h4>feedback inhibition <span class="p">effect of a product of a reaction sequence to decrease its further production by inhibiting the activity of the first enzyme in the pathway that produces it</span></h4><h4>free energy <span class="p">Gibbs free energy is the usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.</span></h4><h4>heat  <span class="p">energy energy transferred from one system to another that is not work (energy of the motion of molecules or particles)</span></h4><h4>heat energy <span class="p">total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction</span></h4><h4>induced fit  <span class="p">dynamic fit between the enzyme and its substrate, in which both components modify their structures to allow for ideal binding</span></h4><h4>kinetic  energy <span class="p">type of energy associated with objects or particles in motion</span></h4><h4>metabolism <span class="p">all the chemical reactions that take place inside cells, including anabolism and catabolism</span></h4><h4>phosphoanhydride bond   <span class="p">bond that connects phosphates in an ATP molecule</span></h4><h4>potential energy  <span class="p">type of energy that has the potential to do work;

By harnessing energy from the sun, the evolution of photosynthesis allowed living things access to enormous amounts of energy. Because of photosynthesis, living things gained access to sufficient energy that allowed them to build new structures and achieve the biodiversity evident today.<br/>Only certain organisms, called photoautotrophs, can perform photosynthesis; they require the presence of chlorophyll, a specialized pigment that absorbs certain portions of the visible spectrum and can capture energy from sunlight. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble carbohydrate molecules and release oxygen as a waste product into the atmosphere. Eukaryotic autotrophs, such as plants and algae, have organelles called chloroplasts in which photosynthesis takes place, and starch accumulates. In prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the process is less localized and occurs within folded membranes, extensions of the plasma membrane, and in the cytoplasm.</p><h3>8.2 The Light-Dependent Reaction of Photosynthesis</h3><p>The pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight. A photon strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. The energy travels to the reaction center that contains chlorophyll <i>a </i>and then to the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior. This action builds up a high concentration of ions. The ions flow through ATP synthase via chemiosmosis to form<br/>molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy and reducing power carrier for the light-independent reactions.</p><h3>8.3 Using Light to Make Organic  Molecules</h3><p>Using the energy carriers formed in the first steps of photosynthesis, the light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle, take in CO<span class="s1">2 </span>from the environment.

Signaling cells secrete ligands that bind to target cells and initiate a chain of events within the target cell. The four categories of signaling in multicellular organisms are paracrine signaling, endocrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions. Paracrine signaling takes place over short distances. Endocrine signals are carried long distances through the bloodstream by hormones, and autocrine signals are received by the same cell that sent the signal or other nearby cells of the same kind. Gap junctions allow small molecules, including signaling molecules, to flow between neighboring cells.<br/>Internal receptors are found in the cell cytoplasm. Here, they bind ligand molecules that cross the plasma membrane; these receptor-ligand complexes move to the nucleus and interact directly with cellular DNA. Cell-surface receptors transmit a signal from outside the cell to the cytoplasm. Ion channel-linked receptors, when bound to their ligands, form a pore through the plasma membrane through which certain ions can pass. G-protein-linked receptors interact with a G-protein on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, promoting the exchange of bound GDP for GTP and interacting with other enzymes or ion channels to transmit a signal. Enzyme-linked receptors transmit a signal from outside the cell to an intracellular domain of a membrane-bound enzyme. Ligand binding causes activation of the enzyme. Small hydrophobic ligands (like steroids) are able to penetrate the plasma membrane and bind to internal receptors. Water-soluble hydrophilic ligands are unable to pass through the membrane; instead, they bind to cell-surface receptors, which transmit the signal to the inside of the cell.</p><h3>9.2 Propagation of the Signal</h3><p>Ligand binding to the receptor allows for signal transduction through the cell. The chain of events that conveys the signal through the cell is called a signaling pathway or cascade. Signaling pathways are often very complex because of the interplay between different proteins. A major component of cell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules by enzymes known as kinases. Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in a<br/>protein, changing their shapes, and activating or inactivating the protein. Small molecules like nucleotides can also be phosphorylated. Second messengers are small, non-protein molecules that are used to transmit a signal within a cell. Some examples of second messengers are calcium ions (Ca<span class="s1">2+</span>), cyclic AMP (cAMP), diacylglycerol (DAG), and inositol<br/><a href="http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6">This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6</a></p></body></html>
